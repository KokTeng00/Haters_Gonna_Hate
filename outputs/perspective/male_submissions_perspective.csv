I also have 2 young children who are also little Sheerios who will not be coming to the show and they've asked me to record  their favorites (which are a lot) for them to hear later. Anyways. I'm just curious what people do at concerts nowadays. Can you even truly enjoy yourself if you're holding onto a phone? If you're someone who records do you go back and watch? I will be in the seats, not GA so I'm assuming I won't have a super amazing view of him worth recording. 

Also for some strange reason the Minneapolis gig is far from sold out which makes me quite sad because other venues are having record breaking amounts of people show up for him and I think everyone here knows he is truly amazing.

Do we think this could be beneficial?

This is a blessing since there is a lotnof info, but also a curse as things can go very far very quickly.

I understand it will need to be heavily moderated to protect everyone involved. This is no issue. Again, just surveying the concept to see if there could be any value. I know many parents who could really use some support, and I'm sure many young adults like yourself feel embarrassed or nervous to ask questions to those in their personal lives. Allowing for a moderated safe-space where you can ask questions and seek advice in a non-judgmental format could potentially be of some benefit.

13713,"In our latest installment of [Suchwita](https://youtu.be/5xfosKUglZw), J-Hope was interviewed by Suga, aka Agust D aka Min Yoongi, to celebrate the first anniversary of Jack in the Box and we learned so many things. Here are some of the most surprising: 

1. J-Hope has an upcoming documentary to be released in 2024 called Hope In The Street. Hobi went to different cities around the world to film about street dance, his first love. 

2. The documentary will have a 6 song OST. It‚Äôs mostly music you can dance to with a happy vibe. 

3. Despite what many people thought, it was his idea to release Jack in the Box solely as a Weverse Album and LP. However, after so much desire from Army, he hurriedly prepared for the album to be released in cd form for its first anniversary. 

4. Hobi already has a six month plan post enlistment

5. Hobi and Suga would go to dance classes together and also to watch dance battles. 

All in all I absolutely enjoyed learning more about him and about Bangtan as a whole. Suchwita has become one of my favorite web talk shows. Suga is a great interviewer. I am also loving that the editors are furthering the Yoongi is a cat agenda.

**Background**

I don‚Äôt think I need to waste my time introducing Drake at this point. Aubrey Drake Graham has spent the past 15 years dominating the charts. At this current stage in his career, he has seemingly forgone trying to make critical successes, and is simply making whatever he wants, accentuated by the two releases before his latest album, those being ‚ÄúHonestly, Nevermind,‚Äù a house album that sticks out like a sore thumb in his discography, and ‚ÄúHer Loss,‚Äù a collab album with Atlanta rapper 21 Savage that many fans saw as a return to form for Drake. Though most of his output has been panned since the release of his 2018 album ‚ÄúScorpion,‚Äù the hype for ‚ÄúFor All the Dogs‚Äù was still through the roof.

‚ÄúFor All the Dogs‚Äù hangs on to the darker, airier sound that Drake has been running with since ‚ÄúScorpion,‚Äù but it leans heavily on Drake‚Äôs R&B influences for most of the album. The album features production from Drake‚Äôs normal cast, but also heavy contributions from Lil Yachty and BNYX.

**Review**

The album begins with an all-time Drake opener, ‚ÄúVirginia Beach.‚Äù The song samples Frank Ocean‚Äôs little known ‚ÄúWise Man‚Äù song from ‚ÄúDjango Unchained.‚Äù Regardless of ‚ÄúFor All the Dogs‚Äô‚Äù negative feedback, ‚ÄúVirginia Beach‚Äù serves as a strong opener, cleverly using a sample of another highly anticipated artist to set the bar for his latest output. ‚ÄúVirginia Beach‚Äù doesn‚Äôt bring much to the table in terms of lyrical uniqueness in Drake‚Äôs catalog, but the production and melodies make it stand out.

The second song, ‚ÄúAmen,‚Äù features up-and-coming star Teezo Touchdown, previously featured on Tyler, The Creator‚Äôs ‚ÄúCall Me if You Get Lost,‚Äù Don Toliver‚Äôs ‚ÄúLove Sick‚Äù and Travis Scott‚Äôs ‚ÄúUTOPIA.‚Äù Teezo brings some beautiful vocals to a very bouncy and light song that brings religious references to yet another Drake love song. ‚ÄúCalling for You,‚Äù the next song on the tracklist, brings a Jersey club sound to the album, featuring Drake recounting his flirtatious expeditions with a woman in a Miami club, before an unnecessarily long and obnoxious interlude from Baby M, a model/escort that Drake has referenced before, which may potentially be about Houston Rockets enforcer Dillon Brooks (which is fucking hilarious, by the way).

‚ÄúFear of Heights‚Äù is most likely another diss against Rihanna, who has started a family with A$AP Rocky, and features another transition from an airy R&B track into a Memphis/rage-esque second half. The track truthfully stands as one of the weaker songs on the album, transitioning into the similarly uninspiring ‚ÄúDaylight‚Äù (although it does end with a snippet of ‚ÄúMy Man Freestyle‚Äù by Adonis Graham, which is one of our generation's greatest works). These two tracks stand as an example of songs that, while they aren‚Äôt necessarily purposeless in Drake‚Äôs discography, feel out of place on such an R&B-focused album that is already bloated to begin with.

Though the album is largely R&B centric, ‚ÄúFirst Person Shooter‚Äù still deserves a shout as one of the stronger rap cuts on the album. In Drake and J. Cole‚Äôs first collaboration in nearly a decade, they create what feels like their version of Sicko Mode, dropping a chart-topping rap track with traded verses and a beat switch in the middle. Cole‚Äôs presence was very welcome, bringing some aggression from Drake. The next track, ‚ÄúIDGAF,‚Äù also stands out as a rap track, but on the other side of the spectrum. Where ‚ÄúFirst Person Shooter‚Äù features one of rap‚Äôs longtime heroes of the 2010s, ‚ÄúIDGAF‚Äù is a rage track that sounds like it came straight out of a Yeat album, who is featured on the track, but really owns the song. Drake drops a verse that has been memed to virality, but Yeat handles the hook and drops his own verse, keeping it nonchalant but cold. Though much can be said about these two songs‚Äô inclusion on the album, they did end up going #1 and #2, respectively, on the Billboard Hot 100.

The track ‚Äú7969 Santa‚Äù begins perhaps the best stretch of the album, bringing a similar feeling to ‚ÄúCertified Lover Boy‚Äôs‚Äù ‚ÄúTSU‚Äù with an R&B twist. The track is entirely dedicated to an ex of Drake‚Äôs, Delilah, who is also referenced in the track‚Äôs title. 7969 is the number of the Delilah nightclub in Hollywood, where Drake wishes to forget his problems with the girl of the same name, featuring a sample of Chief Keef‚Äôs classic ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Like.‚Äù The song finishes with a second appearance from Teezo Touchdown, where he delivers his standout ‚Äúdogs will be dogs‚Äù solo. This flows into the lead single of the album, ‚ÄúSlime You Out‚Äù with SZA. Though the production is sound and SZA delivers a great verse, it feels like an odd choice for a single, and (in my opinion) is the weakest track in the excellent stretch from ‚Äú7969 Santa‚Äù to ‚ÄúDrew a Picasso,‚Äù aside from the interlude.

The next track, ‚ÄúBahamas Promises,‚Äù is a very melancholy track where Drake reminisces on another old relationship, complaining about a ruined Bahamas trip that could‚Äôve happened if the woman in question was faithful. This transitions into ‚ÄúTried Our Best,‚Äù where Drake continues to vent about a turbulent relationship. Though neither of these songs are bringing much to the table, they still stand as some of Drake‚Äôs stronger R&B cuts, and some of the better songs on the album, due to their production and vocals. These songs are capped off by the ‚ÄúScrew the World‚Äù interlude, which features some chopped and screwed DJ Screw vocals over Nas‚Äô classic ‚ÄúIf I Ruled the World.‚Äù

‚ÄúDrew a Picasso‚Äù is one of the stronger cuts on the album, featuring some dark R&B production with a beautiful vocal sample, where Drake continues to vent, seemingly about the formerly-mentioned Baby M. Drake expresses his pain of a strained relationship with her, saying the idea of her with somebody else (Dillon Brooks) makes him so embarrassed that he wants to die. Following this track, PARTYNEXTDOOR and Drake reunite on ‚ÄúMembers Only,‚Äù another Drake and PND R&B deep cut. Though it is great to hear PARTY again, this collaboration doesn‚Äôt stick out much compared to any of their other collaborations, such as ‚ÄúCome and See Me‚Äù or ‚ÄúSince Way Back.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat Would Pluto Do‚Äù allows Drake to show one of his bigger influences of the last couple of years, Lil Yachty. Though Yachty contributed to production on ‚ÄúCalling for You‚Äù earlier in the album, ‚ÄúWhat Would Pluto Do‚Äù is the first time that the Yachty influence shows bright and clear. Though the song is a strong melodic rap track, the ‚Äúokay‚Äù verse at the beginning of the album feels like a strong hook that wasn‚Äôt fleshed out at all in the rest of the song. ‚ÄúAll the Parties,‚Äù the following track, suffers from a similar issue, delivering a strong start that falls off immediately after Chief Keef‚Äôs strong hook. Drake keeps the song going through a percussion-less R&B transition, but it leaves a bit to be desired compared to the first minute of the song.

‚Äú8am in Charlotte‚Äù serves as one of the most unexpected Drake cuts I have ever heard in the last decade. With the expectations of Drake dropping a pure rap cut dropping year-by-year since ‚ÄúIf You‚Äôre Reading This‚Äôs‚Äù release, a song of Drake not only purely rapping, but also over a Conductor Williams beat, came out of absolutely nowhere. Drake over some laid back production from the frequent Griselda-collaborator manages to bring a breath of fresh air to Drake‚Äôs catalog while still sounding like a classic time-and-date cut off of a Drake record. It would be ignorant of me to praise this pure-rap cut on an R&B album while criticizing others on the album, but it does stand as one of Drake‚Äôs better songs in his modern discography. It would be incredible to hear a full project of Drake rapping over modern underground-style production, but it is unlikely to happen. Unless‚Ä¶

Allow me to insert my bias for a moment. The song ‚ÄúBBL Love‚Äù is considered by many to be one of the worst songs not only on this album, but in Drake‚Äôs discography. I can‚Äôt help but love it though. The BBL/love metaphor is terrible, but it kind of works. I‚Äôm really just a sucker for the production, which samples the deep soul cut ‚ÄúLoving You‚Äù by Liquid Fire. The song is truly carried by the sample, but damn is it one of my guilty pleasure songs of the year. But yeah, it probably sucks in reality.

‚ÄúGently‚Äù brings a collaboration between two of the biggest artists in the world that still somehow falls flat. Drake, who still runs North American rap despite the criticism, and Bad Bunny, who has become one of the most-streamed artists ever and helped bring reggaeton to the charts in America in the last few years, came together for a forgettable collaboration that did numbers but didn‚Äôt stick very hard. ‚ÄúRich Baby Daddy‚Äù is another collab with a highly-discussed artist in another sense, with a potent hook from Sexyy Red being the centerpiece of the song. This is another song that is kind of terrible, but Sexyy Red‚Äôs hook is slightly contagious, and SZA delivers a powerful second feature. This song is kind of like ‚ÄúWay 2 Sexy‚Äù but oddly less terrible to my ears. In my guilty opinion.

‚ÄúAnother Late Night‚Äù brings the Yachty influence back in a big way, grabbing Yachty for a feature along with his production. I‚Äôm probably (definitely) going to let my biases show one more time. Lil Yachty, despite his resurgence, still seems to be an extremely polarizing artist, as I feel this song has gone unnoticed. Both Drake and Yachty have some silly-ass bars on this song while also keeping it quite chill on some uplifting production. Drake once again disses A$AP Rocky and  Dillon Brooks, who talks a lot of shit for being ass, and references the Millie Bobby Brown allegations all in one verse. Lil Yachty drops an all-time out of pocket Billie Eilish bar as well. This song isn‚Äôt for everybody, but those who have had their ears turned to the Concrete Boys lately will enjoy.

‚ÄúAway from Home‚Äù is the grail of this album for many Drake fans, from what I have seen. The song has yet another production contribution from Lil Yachty, where Drake reminisces on his comeup, expressing his boredom with wealth. The hook sees Drake remembering when success meant more to him in his hungrier youth, whereas now he has everything he could ever want, and stands on his own among most rappers (and artists in general, at this point) in terms of wealth. The album closes with ‚ÄúPolar Opposites,‚Äù a strong closer that does cover the same old Drake topics, but fits the theme of the album and features more excellent production.

**For All the Dogs: Scary Hours Edition**

So it turns out Drake actually would drop a project with modern underground-style production. As a deluxe version of ‚ÄúFor All the Dogs,‚Äù Drake attached a third edition of his ‚ÄúScary Hours‚Äù series with six tracks, five of which featuring Drake straight rapping, something that we haven‚Äôt seen in a while. The production is star-studded for rap fans, featuring The Alchemist, Conductor Williams, Ovrkast., and another J. Cole appearance. The intro, ‚ÄúRed Button,‚Äù shows Drake is not playing around, dropping a full verse including disses to long-time collaborator and competition Kanye West, which includes praise to West‚Äôs mortal enemy Taylor Swift

‚ÄúStories About My Brother‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Shoe Fits‚Äù are two instant classics to Drake‚Äôs discog. ‚ÄúStories About My Brother‚Äù features a simple yet incredible sample and production from Conductor Williams, where Drake brags about the accomplishments of those who came up with him. ‚ÄúThe Shoe Fits‚Äù features a longform diss against promiscuous, fake-lavish women and the inferior men they choose to spend their time with, with incredible production from Ovrkast. and Lil Yachty. ‚ÄúWick Man‚Äù features the extremely unexpected Drake and Alchemist collaboration, which admittedly disappointed me slightly, but it‚Äôs followed by ‚ÄúEvil Ways,‚Äù yet another collab with J. Cole. On this song, the two rappers go bar-for-bar instead of verse-for-verse, over some beautiful production to cap off the EP, save for ‚ÄúYou Broke My Heart.‚Äù The final track on the deluxe feels like it should be on the main album, with extremely loud production backing Drake crooning over a lover‚Äôs betrayal.

**Final Thoughts**

‚ÄúFor All the Dogs,‚Äù like pretty much every Drake album since ‚ÄúViews,‚Äù is a grower for many Drake fans, including myself. The album fell flat for me on the first listen, but over time, I found most of the album falling into my rotation at some point during the last few months of the year. The dark and grimy production with R&B influence of ‚ÄúHer Loss‚Äù carries over to this new project, with heavier emphasis on the R&B piece. That being said, there are a few rap cuts that feel out of place among the R&B sounds all over the album. In my personal opinion, half of the album sounds like a coherent R&B album from Drake, and the other half is various sounds that Drake dabbles in, laced across the rest of the songs. Though songs like ‚ÄúIDGAF,‚Äù ‚Äú8am in Charlotte,‚Äù and ‚ÄúAnother Late Night‚Äù are some of my favorite songs on the album, they still feel quite out of place. ‚ÄúCalling for You‚Äù and ‚ÄúAll the Parties‚Äù are two really good songs that have a beat switch that feels like it was thrown together for the sake of a beat switch. I‚Äôm nowhere near qualified to make a decision like this, but in my eyes, a strictly-R&B version of ‚ÄúFor All The Dogs‚Äù could be amazing and more coherent if it looked something like this:

1. Virginia Beach
2. Amen
3. 7969 Santa
4. Slime You Out
5. Bahamas Promises
6. Tried Our Best
7. Drew a Picasso
8. Members Only
9. What Would Pluto Do
10. BBL Love
11. Away from Home
12. Polar Opposites

Regardless of my feelings on this album‚Äôs tracklist, I think it holds together as one of Drake‚Äôs best albums in the 2020s, as low as that bar may be. It feels stronger than ‚ÄúCertified Lover Boy‚Äù to an extent, and I think some of his best R&B cuts can be found on this album, especially compared to his output in the ‚ÄúViews‚Äù era and beyond. At this point, Drake seems to be putting out whatever he wants, which can have a detrimental effect on the overall cohesion of his projects, but some amazing songs can still come out of it. The expectations of a new ‚ÄúTake Care‚Äù or ‚ÄúIf You‚Äôre Reading This‚Äù are hopeless if you‚Äôre still waiting, but if you take his latest output at face value, you‚Äôre bound to walk out with at least a few songs you like.

In terms of complaints of Drake being nearly 40 years old and still rapping about his exes and women, I think this is overblown, considering Drake collaborators like Future, Lil Wayne and Rick Ross have done the same for years without a peep. However, this doesn‚Äôt change anything about criticisms of Drake‚Äôs subject matter becoming somewhat repetitive at this point. I think he still says what he wants to say cleverly enough that it can pass, but it is certainly noticeable. Despite this, I‚Äôve thoroughly enjoyed this album throughout the fall and winter, and expect to do so going into the new year.

I also need to highlight the Scary Hours Edition; this short EP is one of the best things Drake has ever put out. On these tracks and ‚Äú8am in Charlotte,‚Äù Drake shows he can still rap-rap. His ear for beats hasn‚Äôt gone anywhere either, and the production throughout the EP is top-notch, with some of his best verses in years. I won‚Äôt judge it in the context of the main album, but as an EP it is very, very good.

This is the place to bring any thoughts, opinions, and reactions you have to our club's reading material for the week. Please feel free to read at your own pace and join the discussion whenever you're ready to share your thoughts. We want this to be a welcoming space for conversation and reflection.

Our beloved u/chesari \- who serves as our Book Club facilitator - has some family obligations this weekend, so I‚Äôll be pinch-hitting for her this week.

This week we'll be discussing chapter 5 (focusing on the Love Yourself Era) of our seven favorite guys' new band biography, Beyond The Story: 10-Year Record of BTS. Comments below will include spoilers through the end of chapter 5! So if you don't want to be spoiled, please wait until you've finished the chapter before reading the comments.

If anyone has read ahead and wants to comment something related to future chapters, two things: 1) use spoiler tags to protect anything you say that might spoil the content of chapters 5 and beyond for others, and 2) your comment should also be related to the chapter we're currently discussing, not just a future chapter.

Here are a few questions as food for thought:

‚Ä¢	Was there anything in this chapter that you found surprising?

‚Ä¢	If you were to sum up this chapter with one word, what word would you choose and why?

‚Ä¢	What part of this chapter had the most emotional impact for you?

Finally, u/chesari will be sharing the QR code links associated with this chapter next week.  And a quick word of sincere thanks to her for always going the extra mile.  üíúüíú

Even wonder went a K-pop Group will perform at the Halftime Show, and who will it be and went. BTS and TWICE are both one of popular groups in the world with both selling out Stadium in US. 

It be cool, if these two collaborators, I believed they could collaborate by perform the Super Bowl Halftime.

I highly doubt that two will happen performing at the Super Bowl, they both have good fanbases. 

What good things that can come out is that they both put on a good show performance some of their songs. 

BTS: Dynamite and Butter 

TWICE: Fancy and Feel Special 

What bad things is the language ge barrier, people not knowing who they are, and worried that show could collapse. 

What your though on BTS and TWICE collaboration for the Super Bowl Halftime?

My music taste is amazing. Perhaps the closest thing to a perfect music taste you can get. I listen to Radiohead, Swans, Pink Floyd, LCD Soundsystem, Bjork amongst others. So you can clearly see my taste is of an elite and impeccable standard. And I get that not everyone can have a perfect music taste, listening to the objectively best music in the world, but for me I just don‚Äôt get it.

I like Polar Opposites and Amen the best so far. These songs feel like quality that want to convey a message. But a lot of songs are very generic, perfect for Streaming Numbers and the TikTok generation. Lots of autotune and features that appeal to today's youth. No Rick Ross, Lil Wayne, Chris Brown or Nicky Minaj. Of course the whole thing makes sense from success...it's a business and you want to still be successful and relevant in 5 years. You just have to accept that. There will always be individual songs that hit and feel great.

8063,"I've been following Bad Bunny since day 1, although I didn't like him that much at that time, I was more of a Ozuna fan. People were hyping this new album, because he was going to go back to his trap era, but I wasn't that excited for it. I think that Bad Bunny separated himself from the rest of latin artists from his generation when he released his first album and left Hear This Music. Although he has done trap since that, it is not the same as when he started, and that's great in my opinion, because he evolved for the better. And I find that people who wanted that Bad Bunny, are going to be disappointed with this new album, because as I said, although it has a bunch of traps, it is not the same. In my personal opinion, the intro to this album (Nadie Sabe) is one of the best songs of his career, and it robbed the shine from all the other songs of the album, making it feel like the album was going downhill, although there we other really good songs still. Songs like: MR OCTOBER, CYBERTRUCK, VOU 787, are other highlights of the album, in my opinion. I'm speaking after my very first listen, so it can maybe grow or fall on me, but I think this is better than his last album. My ranking, rn would be:

12854,"Hi everyone! I am going to be attending my very first Ed Sheeran concert and first concert in about 10 years! I snagged some floor tickets for one of Ed‚Äôs last Mathematics tour dates and with my lack of experience attending these events I would like some advice on how to make it the best experience!

I will be going with my boyfriend and we both have different places that we want to stand during the concert. I wanted to get there super early and get to the front of the gates but am worried about not seeing him over the stage since I‚Äôm only around 5‚Äô2‚Äù and will definitely not be wearing any heels while standing for hours. My boyfriend thinks it would be more enjoyable against another gate but one more towards some of the side stages or other platforms. I know I want to be close enough to see him physically and not just on a screen so I can get great photos and videos and I don‚Äôt want my view obstructed by taller people or other equipment in the stadium.

Would some of you mind sharing some advice on when we should get there, where to go and how close you got, and maybe a few of the photos and videos that you got during his Mathematics stadium tours from the standing room sections? I would love to hear everyone‚Äôs experiences and see everyone‚Äôs views and try to make the most enjoyable decision for the concert. 

Thank you so very much in advance!!!

9592,"I understand there's been some tension in this sub over the quality of performances for this tour. I'm not tryna to defend Drake or anything but I thought it would be common knowledge that he wasn't gonna perform with all his energy for these concerts. He's just not hungry anymore like the Take Care and NWTS days so obviously he won't go out of his way for these performances like he's an upcoming artist. However, I do agree that fans shouldn't be spending hundreds and thousands of dollars for these half ass performances so what are your suggestions on how Drake can improve for the next tour?


I'll start. Maybe he should incorporate a band and backup singers or dancers. Most of the biggest and best musicians in the world use this approach for performances and I feel like it would suit Drake. He could still do less and the show would provide more. This would also take some pressure off of him.

Side note: I went to his concert last week and I really enjoyed it (9/10) I'm just coming up with solutions for those with complaints. The only thing that I didn't like at the show was too much pausing, speeches, etc.

11792," Next year, Post Malone will do a set at Stagecoach, the weekend-long country-music festival on the polo grounds of Coachella. His music already has the boozy, confessional quality of country music, so it isn‚Äôt a complete stretch. But this will be his first proper set within the genre. The seed was planted a couple years ago, when Malone closed out Matthew McConaughey‚Äôs ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre Texas‚Äù fundraiser, and ‚ÄúI had the idea to do a set of country covers, a lot of nineties and 2000s stuff.‚Äù His appearance with Dwight Yoakam‚Äôs backing band from that night is on YouTube, and it‚Äôs remarkable.

3107,"Hi! I have a massive BTS collection from 2013-2022 that I'm slowly trying to let go of. Prices are negotiable and I am open to further discounts for bulk purchases!

PCs sold with the album they came in. Price is $3 less than whatever the lowest price you can find from a US retailer (B&N, Target, Walmart, Weverse, etc.). Just send a screenshot or a link so I can verify. PCs are mainly Taehyung and/or OT7 (group), as applicable. The exceptions are the more rare PCs (dope, LYS holos, etc.) which are not sold with the album and are QYOP. Where I have more PCs than albums (i.e., Dark and Wild, Wings, MOTS7, etc.), I will include all the PCs if you buy all the versions of the albums. For example, for D&W, I only have 1 album, but have 4 PCs; for Wings and MOTS7, I have all 4 versions, and 8 PCs (meaning you are getting a bunch of extra PCs for free).

Free shipping via media mail (US only) for purchases over $50. Open to bulk discounts if making a large purchase. The larger the purchase, the larger the discount I'm willing to consider.

I had 12 or so more images of PCs that couldn't fit into the post (maxed out the photo limit), but I collected PCs all the way through Proof. For Butter, BE, and Proof, I have other member options as well - if you are serious about making a purchase, feel free to request and I'll see if I have the PC(s) you're looking for.

Venmo or Paypal F&F preferred, but will accept G&S as long as you cover all the fees.

Thanks for reading!

13684,"There's  been a long ongoing discussion about whether idols should be allowed to  debut as minor which I've been following without getting too involved  so far because my opinion on the issue is pretty straightforward (they  shouldn't). However, a pattern that I've noticed in those discussions  and that has been irking me a lot is that people often bring up Jungkook  as an example of an idol debuting young and still achieving success  (""Well JK debuted at 15 and look at him now!"" sort of arguments), which  admittedly could convince non-fans, but I think BTS fans should know  better and I felt like bringing some facts to the discussion.

First,  I often see the argument that JK doesn't actually regret debuting young  because he says that he's happy he debuted with BTS. Now I do not know  exactly how Jungkook feels about starting to work at 15, as I'm not  inside his head and it's not a topic he often addresses willingly, but I  know that he did [agree that he started working too young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxRsoqzvJuQ)  (@0:48, turn subtitles on) when asked on a variety show, and that he wrote a whole song about [growing up too fast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTh7DIOfd1w)  and feeling inadequately adjusted when comparing his life to his peers.  He also often brings up how he wishes he had studied more and learned  more English, and feeling ""[slower](https://twitter.com/doolsetbangtan/status/1167853733809704960)""   than the other members because he wasn't schooled traditionally. A  quick reminder that Jungkook started training at 13, took a year off  middle school upon debut, and only attended high school sporadically  throughout the years.

I know that a  popular meme among ARMYs was that Jungkook lived √† la Hannah Montana  and attended school by day and performed Blood Sweat and Tears sexily at  night. Tbh this image of JK's [HS uniform](https://twitter.com/jk_97oqol/status/1624714044396666880)  hanging backstage of used to make me laugh too, but looking back it's  less funny and more concerning. It's also worth noting that Jin, who was  only 18 at debut, also said that idols are debuting too young and that  JK used to miss his family in Busan so much during their trainee days  that he would invite him at his own house and for family gatherings so  that he would feel [less lonely](https://twitter.com/jinnieslamp/status/1083919666655817728/photo/1).

That  brings me to my second point: people arguing that he got lucky because,  even though he didn't have his parents around, he was still raised by  the rest of BTS. Now I'm not going to argue against that, he admits  himself that BTS played a huge part in his formative years and that he's  arguably a collection of all their personalities, but do y'all  seriously believe than living with a bunch of barely older teenagers is  the same as having your parents with you? The rest of maknae line was  only two years older than him, and they didn't even join until later in  his trainee life. He was a 13 y-o hanging out with a bunch of 17-18 y-o.  Now I'm sure that his members took good care of him, they adore him  that much is obvious, but no I don't think Jin packed his lunch and  drove him to school everyday. Mostly because JK probably didn't attend  school everyday, but also because Jin had his own things to do and was  in the process of growing up himself. We shouldn't brag about teenagers  ""raising"" younger teenagers.

And I  really don't like the way some people act like he had it better because  he was in BTS, or that he was lucky because Big Hit was somehow much  better than other management companies. JK was the center, main  vocalist, lead dancer and sub-rapper of the group at debut, that's a  whole lot of responsibility for a 15 y-o and it meant that he was at the  forefront when it comes to public opinion. Not only was BTS not that  popular at debut, they also faced very harsh criticisms and Yoongi   talked recently about how he couldn't even understand the amount of hate  they used to get at that time. JK was a teenager and ppl trended  articles about his acne, sometimes even [editing it](https://pannative.blogspot.com/2016/07/hul-is-this-for-real.html) to look worse than it was.

Some  ARMYs also seem to believe that Big Hit was better than the other  agencies, and that it's fine for Hybe and other attached labels to debut  minors. Now, I know that there are much worse companies but Hybe  certainly isn't without blame.  Again, don't want to get into details  but maknae line was in fact sexualized upon debut by having choreos with  hip thrusts and ""abs"" flash, which could have encouraged the fans who  had countdowns for the day he would turn ""legal"" and made overall  inappropriate comments.  We also have seen [reports of bad management](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/3w66id/bighit_entertainment_fires_manager_seen_raising/) with the manager who was fired for allegedly raising his hand at Jungkook, or the [prank they pulled on AHL](https://www.tiktok.com/@jn_vm/video/7039967752735427866) (ignore the cheesy edit). The one for his [16th birthday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yYD2GZdMxM) also leaves a very sour taste in my mouth  and it's something you shouldn't put children through for entertainment imo.

So no, Jungkook's success doesn't nullify the hardships he and the other  members went through, it doesn't make him debuting at 15 and being  sexualized on their first comeback retrospectively ok, and just because  he's satisfied with his life now doesn't mean that we shouldn't talk  about it. Stop using ""But Jungkook/Taemin/Jessica/X idol who debuted young is now successful"" as an argument because you want to see minors debut. No one is guaranteed success. In my opinion, teenagers are not mentally prepared to face this much scrutiny and it's fine if you disagree but don't drag other idols in this. Even though JK is obviously happy to have debuted with BTS and wouldn't trade it for anything, it doesn't mean that other young idols will achieve that kind of success or should even try until they're older.",https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/132s7s1/i_wish_people_would_stop_using_jungkook_as_an/,"I wish people would stop using Jungkook as an example of a ""success"" story for young idols",kpopthoughts,t3_132s7s1,/r/kpopthoughts/comments/132s7s1/i_wish_people_would_stop_using_jungkook_as_an/,2023-04-29 12:55:54,BTS,0.15490346,0.09983836

**AVG : 7.48**  
Overall thoughts : Some really high R&B highs, but too many misses for me but it's a 23 track album I guess. I wish more songs were cut but it is what it is, I liked a solid chunk of the album so will probably just make a playlist of that.  
***Her Loss***

1. Rich Flex : 8/10  
2. Major Distribution : 8/10  
3. On BS : 8/10  
4. BackOutsideBoyz : 8/10

8. Treacherous Twins : 8/10  
9. Circo Loco : 8/10  
10. Pussy and Millions : 9/10  
11. Broke Boys : 8/10

14. More M‚Äôs : 7/10  
15. 3 AM on Glenwood : 8/10  
16. I guess It‚Äôs Fuck Me : 9/10

**AVG : 8.25**

No misses here, some really nice highs as well but mostly a solid 8 for damn near everything. Really consistent Drake album that I really enjoyed and go back to quite often in its entirety.

6455,"Woke up headed to the Post Malone concert. Got there an hour earlier than it said we were allowed to enter the parking lot, but what do you know it‚Äôs been open. Walk up this hill to the line, My husband asks if early entry VIP was this line. They sent us elsewhere , fine. After waiting for ten mins, they tell us early entry is somewhere else. Walk a mile there. No one can tell us if it‚Äôs the right line‚Ä¶ moved again. Still no one at the venue knows. Some say it‚Äôs right some say it‚Äôs not. So we get in (5 hours early in dead summer). Then no one can tell us what line is next, so we are with a bunch of the VIP early entry & we are all getting the run around. 

Then we are waiting and asking everyone. Some say to stay some say don‚Äôt in that line. But we all paid a lot extra to be first in the pit. Finally @ 5 they let us down and then say of wrong row to enter turn around, so everyone who was behind us is in front now. Then we get in , whatever at the rail. Nope tell us we were supposed to be in cause we were in the wrong spot & there‚Äôs a huge line of early entry. All of us are like no we are early entry the staff told us to stay here & that side is saying the same. Then we all are mad, that side bum rushes as we get in & it‚Äôs crazy. So at this point there‚Äôs no waters or anything cause if you leave pit you‚Äôre not getting back in. People are passing out and throwing up left & right, and right before Post comes on ( 30mins late) I pass out. My husband takes me to medical, they say they can‚Äôt help us to our car. But try and tell us where our lot is (we say lot blue). No one knows where lot blue it, so they keep sending us in different directions (this place is giant) so we are all turned around. Finally get to a lot, I can barely stand, I‚Äôm now having an endo flare bleeding like crazy like I have for the past four months straight now. Mike ask security, the cops on golf carts to please help us cause we can‚Äôt find the car. NO ONE WOULD! Said ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt sorry‚Äù. TWO HOURS of walking around not finding our car. I‚Äôm laid up on the side of a pole crying and still no help. No signs of what color lot we are in, no way to figure it out. I finally flag down an ambulance and they helped. Our car got surround by huge RVs (boxed in basically) and unable to see. (Also like no lights in the lot besides a couple on the ends) so at this point concert is over & everywhere is trying to leave, couldn‚Äôt get out of the lot for nearly two hours once we got to our car.

1199,"Hi, my show is tomorrow and I got the itinerary yesterday. Since it‚Äôs the final dates I was curious how everyone‚Äôs experience was with VIP?

I called my venue a couple months ago to confirm they participated for the free VIP parking that the package offered, now they have changed their mind so I spent $80 on a spot to park. Oh, well!

And I find it a little odd the ultra surprise gift item is not allowed in the venue, especially since they rent out lawn chairs and from what I understand the gift is a camo chair with Austin engraved. I haven‚Äôt seen a picture of it, is it cute? Also, did you have to wait at the back of the line again after putting it away in your car?

I know lanyards not having arrived was an issue at the beginning of the tour and now I‚Äôve read they ran out of the vip shirts at a recent show. Just hoping I get everything I paid for in the package since this is a total splurge for me and I want the full experience.

Either way, I know it‚Äôs going to be a great night, it‚Äôs my third time seeing Posty. He puts on a fantastic show and never disappoints! And Zack and Codeine on the setlist, omg - very excited for that! 

Oh! Were their bags to put items from the merch booth in? I didn‚Äôt notice a tote this year and I am hoping to have a way to carry everything since I have been tasked with bringing merch back for family and I know I would like a few items myself.

3299,"So today we got 'Jack in the box (Hope edition)' physical release with additional Lollapalooza live version tracks and Instrumentals. I was waiting for this day from a month and it's now finally here!!! 

I'd like to take this opportunity to appreciate Jack in the box as a whole album. It's my favourite project from last year and still going very very strong on my daily playlists. Jhope took a very bold step with this album and dared to do something different. Even though the sound is different from his previous releases, JITB still remains quintessentially very much jhope. One thing I love about JITB is how raw and vulnerable he gets, talking about the ""being jhope"" and what it means to be BTS hope, contemplates about whether he'd still be this bright if he had not achieved what he has, wondering whether he will get to a safe place, how will he feel if he will not a his fans support. And then we have songs like STOP and Equal sign just very loudly stating so many facts. Although the songs are short but they are not short for streaming purpose, they are because that's he wants to say. Many songs don't have chorus or brigde, he didn't waste any time and just went on track to track telling his story.

In HE, they added lolla versions and let me tell you, the experience of listening to them is out of body, especially 'FUTURE lolla version'. It has his ending ment from lolla and it got me right in the feels. Now for instrumentals, it's seems foul for me to say this but these are my favourite addictions. 'MORE' instrumental version is on repeat for me, it's soooooo good I am obsessed. And those adlibs on 'ARSON' version is ü§åüèª no words truly. 

I am so happy for J-hope and can't wait to get my hands on the album, which btw is dope. The album design is another thing Hoseok is perfect at and he didn't disappoint. Just look at the dopest album cover and those characters he created ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• spoiler alert but [this](https://twitter.com/912daze/status/1692381663291146670?t=rwOK429Ia8yCSy1AVX30oA&s=19) is so cute.

2157,"Ok, so I was just listening to Moving on repeat for a while coming up with crazy scenarios and theorizing who it is about because I saw another thread that was debating it a little. I've heard all sorts of theories about past exes who he had messy breakups with, and I was intrigued because the song is a bit scathing. And then it just hit me: Ellie Goulding.

The whole situation was messy, and both Goulding and Ed wrote songs about it. Yet Ed said in an interview that writing Don't was very therapeutic and he no longer feels as much hurt and resentment. This fits with Moving because he says this is the last song he'll ever write about her, and he also tells her to ""forget it even happened"", showing that he's over it.

I originally thought the song was an old track from 2013 or 2014 repurposed for Subtract, but now I think it was written a bit more recently because I remember seeing an article a few months back about Ellie Goulding talking about how the cheating rumors with Niall Horan and Ed Sheeran dealt a hand on her mental health. And in Moving, it says "" I never wanna hear your name again,"" so I'm guessing he's a bit miffed that she's ""airing dirty laundry"" that he has moved on from, so he wrote  ""the last song I'm writing 'bout you \[her\]"" to address it.

With the holidays coming up, I would really like to surprise an ARMY with a box of gently used Bangtan goodies. The items include some earrings for pierced ears and potentially some size small clothes, just FYI. The stuff also skews cute and seem too young for some people‚Äôs taste. 

My target audience for this post is someone who has an ARMY in their life who would appreciate getting some gently used Bangtan merch (official and fan made) for Christmas (or an upcoming birthday or whatever holiday you celebrate). Maybe your kid or younger sibling? Maybe your best friend? I would love to be their ARMY secret Santa. 

 I grew up very poor and remember how much it sucked to fangirl but never be able to have a poster on my wall or a t shirt of my favorite band. I also remember being fortunate to get gently used donations for Christmas each year because my mother couldn‚Äôt afford to buy me Christmas gifts. I like to pay it forward now that I can afford to. I know money is tight right now for a lot of people and buying fun things is on the back burner for many, even for holidays. I did something similar to this a few years ago with Harry Styles merch and it went really well. 

I only have enough stuff for one to three people right now so I‚Äôll remove this post when I get to that number of interested responses. I also can only ship within the US. If you respond here that you‚Äôre interested, I‚Äôll DM you to connect.

The news of your upcoming album, ""For All the Dogs,"" has already started to circulate, and I couldn't be more thrilled about the possibility of new music from you.

The title alone suggests a unique and heartfelt concept, and I have no doubt that the album will be another masterpiece that showcases your growth as an artist. Your ability to blend various genres, deliver introspective lyrics, and craft unforgettable hooks is unparalleled. As such, I am kindly requesting that you consider dropping ""For All the Dogs"" at your earliest convenience.

Your music has a special way of bringing people together and providing a soundtrack to their lives. In these times of uncertainty and change, the world could greatly benefit from the positivity and unity that your music consistently promotes.

8410,"What does everyone think of it? Personally, I won't say that it's a bad song, and by no means are the artists jks collaborating with untalented. But, I just feel like looking back at them & Jack Harlow + Latto, I'm a little underwhelmed by these features/collabs. Like I'm sure there are strategic reasonings for why he chose them, but they're kinda just...there for me. Versus like if he had done a collab with someone like the weeknd, doja cat, ariana etc. or other notorious idols I feel like that would've been a bit more of a serve.

He looks sexy af in the video, and the song is a pretty easy listen so I like it for that. I also think his pronunciation has gotten so much better so it's clear he's been working on it which is admirable. Great vocals from him as always as well. Nothing extravagant, but I don't think all music needs to be. Overall a decent song for me, but nothing phenomenal. And I say this because I KNOW jk is capable of phenomenal. Also, I am happy that he's making the music he likes so I will be streaming anyways hehe.

3577,"Since a lot of y'all are doing rankings in the last days I wanted to do my own in depth ranking. 

To understand my ranking better a small disclaimer in the beginning: 

I became a Drake fan in early 2015 through IYRTITL and he quickly became my favorite artist. I knew a few songs beforehand but didn't really had an opinion on him.

For a lot of you nostalgia plays a big part in their rankings but for me it's not really a factor. I mostly focus on the sonic expierence. Also I am German and English is not my native language (I do understand it very well though), so lyrics aren't that important to me as to others.

So with this out of the way here is my current ranking.

&amp;#x200B;

**13. So Far Gone**

There isn't much to say about this. I have 0 nostalgia for this album as I wasn't a fan back then. To me it just sounds a little dated as his voice, vocal performance and overall production wasn't at the level it now is at that time. Still a enjoyable project with low replay value.

**Highlights:** Lust For Life, Little Bit, The Calm

**Least Played:** Sooner Than Later, Unstoppable

&amp;#x200B;

**12. Thank Me Later**

Similar to SFG, Drake wasn't at the level he is now and again no nostalgia for me. I don't like some of the features (T.I., Swizz Beats, Young Jeezy) but there also is a lot of good music on there.

**Highlights:** The Resistance, Cece's Interlude, Karaoke, Light It Up

**Least Played:** Show Me A Good Time, Find Your Love, Over

&amp;#x200B;

**11. Dark Lane Demo Tapes**

I'm not sure what to write about this. Came as a little appetizer in the quarantine season and overall a quality project. The replay value just isn't as high as of the following projects.

**Highlights:** Not You Too, War, Losses, Chicago Freestyle

**Least Played:** D4L

&amp;#x200B;

**10. What A Time To Be Alive**

I can't really remember the time when it came out. I liked it when it came out and it fulfills its purpose well, but as it doesn't really has that much depth in production or lyrics it lacks the replay value that other Drake projects have. This is also the album were Drake's cadence started to change and I prefer his cadence since then to his older one.

**Highlights:** Diamonds Dancing, Plastic Bag

**Least Played:** probably I'm The Plug

&amp;#x200B;

**9. Her Loss**

When Drake released the news that he will drop a collab album with 21 Savage I wasn't really that exicted as the Atlanta trap sound is getting a bit stale to me. So my expactions weren't that high. None of the tracks are bad, but songs like Rich Flex, Circo Loco or More M's are not the sound I want from Drake. Still there are some great songs on here and those highlights slightly push it in front of WATTBA and DLDT.

**Highlights:** Hours In Silence, Privileged Rappers, Jumbotron Shit Poppin, I Guess It's Fuck Me

**Least Played:** More M's

&amp;#x200B;

**8. Certified Lover Boy**

Probably the most anticipated Drake album so far after around 3-4 years of build up. I can see why a lot of people don't like it as much but in my first few listens it was 10/10. Now, I would change a lot of it as I feel some features are unnecessary (Jay-Z, Travis Scott) or some songs should've been released otherwise (give Way 2 Sexy to Future, YOLT to Ross or Wayne, Fountains to Tems, release NFITI, Knife Talk and 7am on Bridle Path as SH3). If it was shortened to 15 tracks it would be higher in this list as the highs on this album are some of his best songs ever.

**Highlights:** Girls Want Girls, TSU, Pipe Down, Race My Mind, Fucking Fans

**Least Played:** 7am On Bridle Path, Way 2 Sexy, Knife Talk

&amp;#x200B;

**7. If You're Reading This It's Too Late**

The album that made me interested in Drake's music. I was in a facebook group where we had a dropbox, where we shared weekly releases. Some shared IYRTITL and I gave it a listen. At that time I was heavily into Shlomo, who made dark, trap influenced instrumental music and had made a few Drake remixes. As this album also featured quiet dark production it was quiet easy to get into. Over the years it did drop down in my list as I've lost interest in dark, hard sounding music. Still it contains some of his best songs to this date.

**Highlights:** Madonna, Star67, Now &amp; Forever, Jungle

**Least Played:** Used To

&amp;#x200B;

**6. Scorpion**

If this was released as two seperate albums Side A would be around 9-11 in the list and Side B in the top 3. Side A overall is pretty good, but the standouts aren't as high as on other projects. Side B is where it shines for me as I love RnB Drake and it has some of my favourite RnB songs on here (Peak, Jaded, Don't Matter To Me). Even songs like Ratched Happy Birthday grew on me recently.

**Highlights:** Peak, Summer Games, Jaded, I'm Upset, Don't Matter To Me

**Least Played:** Talk Up, Can't Take A Joke

&amp;#x200B;

**5. Nothing Was The Same**

A lot of you have this as his best album and I can totally understand why. It's consistantly high quality but concise and not bloated. I personally could live without 'The Language' or '305 To My City' but I get why they are on the album. It was higher in my ranking previously but over the last year I didn't play it as much anymore and I preferred other projects. 

**Highlights:** Furthest Thing, Own It, From Time, Connect, Come Thru

**Least Played:** 305 To My City, The Language

&amp;#x200B;

**4. Take Care**

Another one of the usual top 3 contenders. I slightly prefer it to NWTS as it has to offer a little more on the RnB-ish side and I like that it is a little softer. 'Over My Dead Body' might be my favorite Drake intro and there are a lot of Drake classics on this. Imo he could've shortened it a little and I do prefer his current voice and cadence to his old one here, so it dropped down a little bit over time. There are still times where it challenges for number 1 though.

**Highlights:** Over My Dead Body, Crew Love, Marvin's Room, Cameras / Good Ones Go, Doing It Wrong, Look What You've Done

**Least Played:** Make Me Proud, We'll Be Fine

&amp;#x200B;

**3. More Life**

This one was lower a few month ago but I recently found my love for it again. The great songs on here maybe don't reach the hights of the top songs of other albums but the quality overall is very high. It's very diverse in sound but still flows together greatly. 

**Highlights:** Passionfruit, Jorja Interlude, Teenage Fever, , Lose You, Since Way Back

**Least Played:** Skepta Interlude

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Honestly Nevermind**

This is the album with the biggest jump in the rating. I didn't know this was released until I was at work and so could not listen to it until the afternoon. But I read about it on KTT2 and here and therefore know that it was going to be a house album. As I am German and do enjoy a bit of house music I was quiet interested what to expect. I didn't really like 'Falling Back' and 'Texts Go Green' in the beginning but once I heard 'Currents' and 'A Keeper' the doubts were gone. So it climbed up the ranks over the recent month. The only thing that annoy's me is 'Jimmy Cooks'. Not because it's a bad song, but imo it just does not fit on this album at all. I would even treat Liability as more of a bonus song.

**Highlights:** A Keeper, Flight's Booked, Overdrive, Liability

**Least Played:** Jimmy Cooks

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Views**

This was the first Drake album I anticipated as a fan and so the hype was big. As I listened to IYRTITL first and TC and NWTS afterwards I probably had a little different expectations as a lot of people who maybe expected a continuation of the rap heavy NWTS and IYRTITL. But the album delivered for me. Imo it has the best production from all his projects and also is the most OVO focused album. I still find new little sounds in the beats that I didn't really notice before. Also it contains Drake's best vocal performance over a complete album.

As all Drake albums it's not perfect though. I personally would have left off 'Hype', 'Still Here', 'Grammys' and 'Pop Style' but the tracks are still decent enough, that I can enjoy a complete playtrough.

**Highlight:** U With Me, Feel No Ways, Redemption, Fire &amp; Desire

**Least Played:** Pop Style, Hype, Still Here

&amp;#x200B;

Overall I do enjoy all albums and even SFG and TML are a 7/10 to me and place 1-8 are very close. Also my ranking is pretty fluid and could look different again in a few months.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Drizzy/comments/1135mis/my_drake_projects_ranking/,My Drake projects ranking,Drizzy,t3_1135mis,/r/Drizzy/comments/1135mis/my_drake_projects_ranking/,2023-02-15 18:59:05,Drake,0.14950264,0.052813396

Ed spends a good portion of the show in the middle facing one direction. At Met life it‚Äôs section 113. Was on the floor in the middle of that section and had the best view. 

Here‚Äôs what to be aware of / worked: 

- We arrived at the GA waiting area 10:30am and were 39 & 40 in line 

- You can‚Äôt park at Met Life till 1pm so we parked at the American Dream Mall & walked across the sky bride. Made for a super fast departure after the show too. 

- The first 50 of us in line each wrote our line number in sharpie on our hands. 

- Security is an absolute cluster. They don‚Äôt keep you in line order so you have to move quickly through the security & ticket check to get your spot back. The numbers on our hands helped. 

- They took our signs even though Met Life said they were permitted & they were the appropriate size. 

- You CANNOT run. They walk you in groups of 20ish to the stage and then you can take off but can‚Äôt run. 

- While the bathroom & concessions that are up the stairs feel more like a pain in the ass, they are the much less crowded ones. 

- Look for the keyboard on stage. That‚Äôs the side you want to be on. They take it away after Khalid but it‚Äôs a good reference point. 

- You can easily get drinks and go to the bathroom until 7. After that I wouldn‚Äôt leave.

13649,"This is not to try and start any kind of hate towards any members or anything. I am genuinely curious as to who everyone thinks will have the most success as a solo artist. I am going to rank my personal opinion (as an ex army) but please let me know who you think will be the most successful as a soloist,obviously none of them would flop and would all be fairly successful.


1:Jhope- his solo stuff both times blew up tremendously and had a lot of people talking about it. He‚Äôs got a fun energy and has the ability to showcase the 3 top things people look for rap,dance,and vocals. I feel he will have probably the most successful career solo.

2:Jimin- he already has at least 1 really big name in K-pop having wanted to work with him (Taeyang bigbang) and his solos from previous albums are usually the most liked. He has a very pretty voice and is an amazing dancer as well. He will have a very successful solo career as well.

3: it‚Äôs a tie between V and Jungkook honestly- they both are already very popular members. They have the most solo stans as well it seems so i look for them both to have fairly successful solos when they do release their solos. V may not be as popular as jungkook in korea tho because he suits a kinda R&amp;B blues maybe jazzy type sound imo which isn‚Äôt really isn‚Äôt all that popular in Korea.

4:Suga- he isn‚Äôt usually the most popular but out of him RM and Jin id say he‚Äôs probably the most popular. He has a very clear distinct sound to him and a very set style that does well for him. He won‚Äôt be as successful as the other 4 above as he doesn‚Äôt dance a lot and he doesn‚Äôt sing which is what most K-pop fans gravitate to with at least when it comes to soloists. He will be pretty popular with the K-hiphop fans tho.

5:RM- again not a very popular member compared to the others in BTS(tho even the least popular members have more fans that the most popular of some groups) again probably more popular with the K-hiphop fans rather than most K-pop fans as he doesn‚Äôt sing or dance when he‚Äôs solo at least not very much anyways.

6:Jin- Jin is probably the least popular member unfortunately. He still will have a lot of support behind his solo activities once he is discharged. Unfortunately as he isn‚Äôt the best dancer (observation not attacking) and really fits more slow songs I don‚Äôt foresee his solos being as popular as say Jimin or Jhope.


Now I could end up being very wrong with my idea and I am ok with that.

9800,"Some of you like Drake when he‚Äôs on his boombap / backpack rapping. Think: Diplomatic Immunity, Omert√†, Do not Disturb, time and place series, etc. 

Some of you like Drake for his trap high energy bangers. Think: IYARTITL, Her Loss, WATTBA, None stop, Started from the bottom, etc. 

Some of you like Drake for his melodic/ R&B songs. Think: Jungle, Passionfruit, Hold On We‚Äôre Going Home, Race My Mind, etc. 

There‚Äôs a lot more: Caribbean vibes, uk rap, heart break Drake, etc. 

I appreciate all of his styles but my personal favorite has to be nocturnal Drake. Those songs that you could get lost in at 2AM in the morning for hours on loop. Let me show you what I mean.  

Here‚Äôs an example of a nocturnal song of some projects: 
Nothing Was The Same - Connect 
What A Time To Be Alive - Plastic Bag 
Views - Fire & Desire 
Scorpion - Jaded 
Dark Lane Demo Tapes - Not You Too 
Her Loss - I Guess It‚Äôs Fuck Me

None of his projects emphasize this nocturnal style as priority number 1 expect Honestly Nevermind. It still has some outliers because it‚Äôs Drake and the dude is diverse so we get some bangers (Sticky, Jimmy Crooks) but everything else is either house (fits the nocturnal sound well with its song structure and sonic in general) or Nocturnal. We also get Drake‚Äôs most nocturnal song imo with Liability (shout out to the slow and reverb community) 

I don‚Äôt think there is a better Drake project for when 
you‚Äôre lonely, it‚Äôs night, and you‚Äôre aimlessly driving just to feel something than Honestly Nevermind. 

Nothing Was the Same, Views, and Scorpion Side B are honorable mentions.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Drizzy/comments/178fmom/honestly_nevermind_is_drakes_most_nocturnally/,Honestly Nevermind is Drake‚Äôs most nocturnally cohesive album and deserves more recognition for it,Drizzy,t3_178fmom,/r/Drizzy/comments/178fmom/honestly_nevermind_is_drakes_most_nocturnally/,2023-10-15 13:42:35,Drake,0.28548008,0.10638656

Another big factor is that there are a lot of people who already have some sort of agenda against Drake and want to see him fall, and they will literally listen to his music with the intend of finding something negative to say.

Jungkook is not very liked anymore in kpop spaces such as twt or tiktok so i deleted my twt cause of all the vile hate he would get i would barely see anything positive about him there.. also deleted my kpop tiktok account and made a new one. 

I think I've detached myself from him and kpop now i find him a bit cringe not as good looking as before and i feel bad about it.. but when i hear my coworkers mention him i still act like a fan and i get happy when i hear his songs in public and sometimes when I'm bored i look him up on tiktok to see what he's been up to.. 

I'm thinking about stanning a western artist cause they don't get as much hate but i just can't fo it for some reason it's not the same.. I also feel kind of dumb for stanning someone in a group i know jk loves his members and won't ever leave bts and it makes me sad because i wish he would just leave kpop and make silly pop music so that mean bts and kpop stans leave him alone but it's obvious he doesn't want that..

With this album being centered on loss, grieving, depression, and challenges; partially fueled further by the Shape Of You court case last year - I can't help but notice the mirroring of what happened this week.

The first day of the Shape Of You court case, Ed's friend Shane Warne passed away, and now his grandmother (the grandmother that inspired 'Nancy Mulligan') passed away during his Thinking Out Loud trial.

I, for one, wish the album had more spotlight than this trial that wasted everyone's money, time, and emotions.

I feel sort of weird for saying this, but I hope that the trial outcome and publicity translates into something good for Ed and helps bring old fans back to his music and new ones to check it out. Specifically, I hope it at least helps Subtract.

I liked how ""Novacandy"" completely changed direction at the beginning of the song. Like there's this aetherial being speaking to me. And then the beat and everything switches. And suddenly, it's a catchy af pop song.

Loved the whole album and the fact that it's solo makes it better.

lmk below how u felt about the album/ what u rated each songüíõ

here were my top three favorite from the album

1. hills of aberfeldy.

this song is pure magic, idk what you would call this style of music but to me it‚Äôs reminds me of parting glass, galway girl, and i see fire and that is personally my favorite style of ed‚Äôs music he kills it everytime. anyways the musicality and vocals in this song are truly indescribable.

2. salt water.

chorus makes me cry and that‚Äôs all i can say like i literally uncontrollably cry so. just yes this song is beautiful it‚Äôs melodic. the lyrics/ meaning hit very hard for me as well.

3. colourblind.

this song just baffles me, the metaphor is so simple yet the way he lyricizes that metaphor is so beautiful. the music esp in the chorus gives me full body chills. it‚Äôs a magical, fairytale like love song. i think i‚Äôd die if someone wrote  songs like this about me, his wife is the luckiest woman. furthermore, this will be played at my wedding.

3316,"Jungkook has shared multiples times that he would love to tour but he acknowledges the lack of enough songs to do so. 

His debut song is Seven but he has 2 SoundCloud songs that he released for BTS anniversary, 3 solo songs include in different BTS albums  and a FIFA soundtrack. For a total of 7 songs:

1. Seven 
2. Still with you
3. My You
4. Dreamers 
5. Begin 
6. Euphoria 
7. My Time
 

Base on his words he is dropping a mini album which can contain 3 to 6 songs. So we can  assume there could be 10 to 13 songs in the setlist.

And add a medley of BTS songs just like SUGA did for his concert. All together can definitely make the concert over an hour. 

Answering my own question: Yes, Jungkook can definitely pull a tour with only a mini album out in fact I think he is capable of doing a tour only covering songs and will sell tons of tickets but he is not going to do that of course. His ambitious and perfectionist ass will never do the bare minimum for his first solo tour.

Coming off a Commercially successful year, that line really encapsulates Drake‚Äôs mindset of just wanting to continue the momentum of success and pushing forward instead of just getting complacent. The Boy was just talking crazy through this whole song but you could tell he meant every word ‚ÄúI keep the fucking lights on in the building man / My record deal should be $500 Million goddamn‚Äù. 

The ending of the song is very climactic and confrontational. He‚Äôs going at his enemies and industry peers throughout the whole third verse.

10502,"TW suicide

All of the Suga D-day promos have been making me revisit all sorts of musical alter-ego acts, MARINA (then-marina and the diamonds)'s *Electra Heart* in particular. In *Electra Heart*, Electra serves as Marina's alter-ego: a beautiful, narcissistic, and damaged heart-breaker, and a representation of american archetypes. The last video released in the EH series seems to suggest Electra's end, and Marina confirms Electra is dead in an interview, saying she killed her ""with sleeping pills, of course"", by which we can infer Electra's suicide. David Bowie's *Ziggy Stardust* run also ends with the ""death"" of Ziggy, apparently [""torn apart onstage"" at the end of the last track](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziggy_Stardust_(character)). Yoongi even references other alter-ego acts like Eminem's *Slim Shady* and Nicki Minaj on palette.

Other things yoongi has said seems to suggest this is Agust D's last run. ""It might be hard to see Agust-d again after this"". It *kind* of makes me think that either the D+ movie or the final MV of D-day will end like Electra Heart being ""[wiped away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhHrrVlshQ8)"".

Also: ""Let's be reborn on this day! **The me of the past is dead** and no longer exists"" -yoongi [palette](https://youtu.be/OP9I2w7UMDc?t=1870)

13742,"Jungkook will be bigger, there's no doubt in it. 

The fandom is busy assuring themselves that BTS will still continue to be a group even if Jungkook becomes a massive solo pop star. And that's understandable because BTS themselves, including Jungkook, had been telling fans for years that they would want to continue being BTS for a long time. 

But I don't think fans could see the future where the media and non fans would only care and want to see Jungkook because they only know him but I can see that happening. He can do all these big things while the members remain mostly within the comfort of the Army fandom, kpop spaces and maybe their own little niche audience.

Armys will argue that ALL the members have really popular solos and that the success go outside the fandom and kpop community. Usually, fans will pull out debut numbers, which were massive but all of them don't have any longevity except Seven. 

Once the media picks up that BTS has its own Harry Styles, Justin Timberlake or Camilla Cabello, the fandom will not be very happy but there will be jabs against other members. And there will be articles about how massive Jungkook is in comparison to the rest of the group.

15536,"Baggy Jeans sucks. That‚Äôs my opinion. I don‚Äôt think the song is any good, but more than that I feel like it‚Äôs insulting and mocking me. I‚Äôve been thinking about this for a while but what‚Äôs really going on in regards to kpop and anti-blackness right now? 

The entire concept of ‚Äúbaggy jeans‚Äù was terrifying from the start and the execution is pretty much exactly what you‚Äôd expect from an NCT project, let‚Äôs play dress up as caricatures of black people, you know the usual! I don‚Äôt care how much they modified the [$294 scarf](https://modesens.com/product/takahiromiyashita-the-soloist-classic-check-scarf-blue-12006763/) tied around someone‚Äôs head, the intention to mimic durags and other Black headwear was fully there.

Not a lot of people (on twitter at least, because that‚Äôs where I engage the most with fandom) have spoken up about the blatant [cultural appropriation](https://twitter.com/nctsmtown/status/1696836744866590947?s=46), and it seems most people commenting on wardrobe to it only to imply that [the clothes are ugly](https://twitter.com/nctsmtown/status/1697619977854243001?s=46). Which they often are but there‚Äôs a bit more to it than that, in my opinion at least. 

After all these years, and several particularly tumultuous eras (especially 2020) I can fully understand why a lot of race related issues, especially things that aren‚Äôt targeted towards a specific individual (like Baggy Jeans) can be somewhat overlooked. But imagine my shock when I *did* find people discussing the extremely distasteful cultural appropriation of Baggy Jeans, but those people were armys üíÄ

And listen right is right and wrong is wrong, I do agree that something is very off about the Baggy Jeans styling. But there was an ulterior motive behind a lot of the discussion.

Why is Kim Taehyung pulling a Jaehyun and [singing along to the n word on live](https://twitter.com/hannigrambtw/status/1696592381867421914?s=46)??? And why are we barely discussing it? So it turns out most of the conversations about baggy jeans and n-word-gate was happening during FANWARS. Everyone is wrong in this situation üò≠

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs on Black fans to always be playing police over their faves, it‚Äôs super exhausting and totally sucks the fun out of kpop. But I know that there had to be a few people that spoke up and got shut down. And possibly a lot more people that were too scared to speak or got ignored. I‚Äôm talking about both situations here. Again, when there are so many more pointed issues going on (like that [stiff dancer on SWF](https://www.pannchoa.com/2023/08/theqoo-street-woman-fighter-2-which.html)being very racist to defend her lack of skill) who can be bothered to give attention to issues like NCT cosplay and V n-word controversy number ??? Especially when words will quite literally do nothing to cause change online or in the industry. I think people are rightfully jaded.

9969,"I was watching a Youtube guy reacting to ""Stories About My Brother"", and thinking that that last part of the song is aimed at Kanye probably, but I do think is for The Weeknd.

We all know that since 2012/13 Drake and The Weeknd have a really strange relation. Making a lot of songs in 2/3 years, then never made another song again. Linking up here and there, but always strange. There are a few Youtube videos explaining a few shots from both sides.

So let me brake down why I thing this is aimed at the Weeknd: (keep in mind that Drake and The Weeknd are both from Toronto)

In ""All The Parties"" (For All The Dogs so really recent) Drake said: ""My bitches playing PND and them, Them shorties don't listen to Weeknd"" & also a couple lines later ""I wish we could be friends, Probably sound like I'm preachin', The city might sleep in some peace then, But it's not realistic"". Clearly some beef is happening there. Drake wouldn't say that about a friend.

In ""Stories About My Brother"", let's brake some lines down:

\- ""Your last album was buns, you niggas Hawaiian as fuck"" - The Weeknd last album was ""Dawn FM"". Probably his worst album (at least from the numbers perspective), being n¬∫2 first week sales behind Gunna when they both dropped same day/week. 

\- ""Cliquein' up with haters that was thinkin' of signin' to us"" - Abel was almost signed to OVO in the Take Care era before PartyNextDoor""

\- ""CN Towerin' over you niggas, I'm giant as fuck , Wait on whoever to say whatever, they quiet as fuck, The city don't love you like that and they fryin' you up, I can't wait for the day that you choose to retire your stuff"" - again, Drake mentioning someone from the city aka Toronto. The Weeknd is usually silence on sending shots in songs, so it makes sense that their beef is behind the scenes, and now this line makes sense ""Wait on whoever to say whatever, they quiet as fuck"". And also, Drake believes he is bigger and more praised in Toronto than Abel since Drake is the 6 God - ""The city don't love you like that..."".

\- ""I can't wait for the day that you choose to retire your stuff, Takin' off the sneakers 'cause you tired of tyin' 'em up, That one day you wake up and tell 'em ""Enough is enough"", That's how you gon' find out you not Kobe Bryant to us"" - In Drake's mind The Weeknd is not that loved in Toronto, so when Abel puts down the mic, he will realize that the city will not care that much. So not loved like Kobe.

\- ""And if them hoes really love you, then them hoes, they lyin' to us, They say they miss when you got 'em wet and you dryin' them up, Also don't doubt that you sent them here, and they spyin' on us"" - The Weeknd's music nowadays is much more pop than R&B, and maybe it doesn't have the same affect on women comparing his first 5 years of making music, that we all know is very sexual and ""female oriented"". ""They say they miss when you got 'em wet and you dryin' them up"". Last line is self explanatory. 

There is alot happening between OVO & XO. 

Take this line from PND (Members Only - recent as well): ""Ask them other guys in the city what happened, LOL gang, we the last ones laughin', Are you jackin' them or jackin' us?, When you ride around the 6, girl, Are you slappin' them or slappin' us?, I know the answer"". - talking about someone from Toronto.

Also Drake in the same song talking to some girl: ""You used to jack the other side, but that shit doesn't phase me, Not at all, Those guys were never gangy, those guys are in a strange place."" - again, talking about someone from Toronto.

That's why I think Drake and The Weeknd are not in good terms. Probably because a girl or something if I would have to bet on it. We all not both of this gentlemen to believe that if they are beefing, it's either about a girl or their egos.

Besides spawning big chart hits like Rich Flex and Spin Bout U, this album is arguably Drake's most rap leaning and critically acclaimed album since If You're Reading This It's Too Late and has higher first week sales than any other 21 Savage project.

This is my favorite Drake album since IYRTITL with Middle of the Ocean being one of his best songs of all time and for 21, I believe this is on par with Savage Mode II.

How does this album compare to Drake and 21's other output?

How does this album compare to Drake and 21's other collab albums with other rappers (What a Time To Be Alive and Without Warning)?

Pre-pandemic I had tickets to her favorite act at the time (Billie Eilish - forgive her, she was 11) that I got at face value - I broke my leg and had to cancel and sell the tickets - but for ~$1,000 profit as she kind of blew up between when I bought them and when I sold them.  I promised her we would find a show and get great seats‚Ä¶ then the pandemic happened.

This year for her birthday she asked me for Drake/21 Savage tickets at our local arena (Wells Fargo Center in Philly) for her and a friend - they have been listening to the new album constantly and she really wants to go.  The ~$1,000 budget is barely getting them into the lower level, but I expect them to be 10-20 rows off the floor‚Ä¶ 

First question - what is the scene like?  Safe for a pair of not very street smart 15 year olds who have never been to a concert?

They are not street smart 15 year olds.  Because it is an arena show I figured the floor might be rowdy but that seats in the lower level would almost certainly be comfortable, but I am not super protective of my daughter, I want her to get out and get out and see some shows and start getting some confidence doing things like this.  Her friend‚Äôs mom was not feeling quite as good about it.  She offered to send her other daughter with them (a college junior) or asked if I could go with them (in either case requiring me to spend a bunch more money or get seats in the upper level).  She has since said she was OK with it, but it took some begging from her daughter.

I have not seen Drake live but figured since he has a big and dedicated fan base and it is a well run venue it was not going to be amateur hour and that if they are not looking for trouble they would not find any.  Am I being naive?

Second question - with the stage setup what were the best views?  It looks like the corners of the stage are going to be pointed to the sidelines and ends of where the basketball court would be‚Ä¶ but that is on a StubHub map‚Ä¶ how is it laid out?

Anyone have any advice on where to get the seats and/or whether I am being a shitty parent (and maybe gaslighting a good parent)?

So, here comes my question: is there a separate VIP standing section from GA section at the barricades where you can potentially get interactions from the idols? If so, how does it work and what is the section called? If it's not separated, then how does VIP standing work and how does it differ from GA? Does VIP ticket holders have to camp out or is it already assigned?

I don't know if you've seen this, but on tiktok videos or YouTube shorts I keep seeing albums by various artists rated by their songs. For example, they'll choose 4 songs: the most popular/commercial hit, the fan favorite, the best one, and the masterpiece. I've seen a lot for Taylor Swift's many albums, but I haven't come across any for Ed Sheeran. What would y'all put for X?

Here's my list:

Most popular: Thinking Out Loud

Fan Favorite: Tenerife Sea

Best One: I'm A Mess/Don't

Masterpiece: Photograph

8492,"given that jungkook's song is pretty much filled with innuedos abt sex (although ... we cannot forget that specific line ...) i was thinking, how do you even convey that effectively in another language, especially in a highly-contextual language like korean?

i watched [several translation videos](https://gall.dcinside.com/mgallery/board/view/?id=jungkook&no=425369) for the song, and it seems that all differ in how literal they translate the english ---> korean, but out of all korean translations i saw, this was the only one that straight up explained ""[yeah it's about sex](https://twitter.com/spaceJK9/status/1679732413361160197?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1679732413361160197%7Ctwgr%5Ecfb6c95a2a593d4507bd404e0e3a4bab8c648354%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheqoo.net%2Fbts%2F2857935919)"" it makes me think - if i was a native korean reading these lyrics (without knowing about the explicit lyric or even the context) is it entirely obvious what the song is hinting at? words like ride, afterglow etc. while are used in a slang fashion in US, obviously don't carry that same connotation when translated literally into korean - at first glance, it might just read as a romantic song about a lover who won't give up 

 for ex. for ""afterglow"", it's pretty obvious to native english speakers as to what it implies in that context, but for the korean translations, i saw Ïó¨Ïö¥ (lingering feelings), Ìô©ÌôÄÌïúÌëúÏ†ï (to have an entranced expression) - another translation just said (""i make it so you don't forget"") but like which translation (and their nuance) best fits the song??!

anyways, it was just interesting seeing the different perspective because often as foreigners, we miss out on a lot of korean cultural nuances/slang (unless it's explicitly explained to us w/ context by translators/native speakers) so observing the reaction to his song from korean speakers has been interesting to see 

a frequent comment i saw was something along the lines of 'i thought only the explicit version was dirty because of the word, but it turns out the clean version is also spicy ..."" 

(another funny comment i saw was ""jk is trying to solve the low birth rate in this country, i respect that"")

i think a lot of understanding of what JK is implying has been understood by korean fans observing american fans and THEIR reaction to the song - one of the comments on a translation video (which made me laugh out loud) was like ""it seems that the foreigners are freaking out over the lyric ""deeper than the ocean"" but i have not figured out why yet. interesting"" 

as long as i've listened to k-pop/followed k-pop news, i've been learning korean - this has to be one of the most unique ways that the language has tried to teach me something üò≠

anyways, i spent wayyy too long looking up korean translations of these ... slang words ... and it turns out google WILL try to give you a visual if you end up too direct in your search. who would've known üôÉ",https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/151gkw6/jungkooks_song_seven_has_me_thinking_about_how/,jungkook's song seven has me thinking about how english slang can be interpreted into korean,kpopthoughts,t3_151gkw6,/r/kpopthoughts/comments/151gkw6/jungkooks_song_seven_has_me_thinking_about_how/,2023-07-16 20:25:47,BTS,0.4013387,0.4142073

Talking about the song itself it's a perfect pop song, it's very catchy and have grooviness in it which I am really glad they went with the UK garage genre, I am obsessed with the pre chorus part and the last chorus part where he sings the adlibs, the intro with the guitar sound really catch you as for jungkook vocals I don't think I need to talk about it, he salyed it, hope we can get more of the way he is singing in Seven is his next releases. 


But aside from the song being a total bop! I had to dedicate a whole post about the MV, I absolutely love it, hands down the best BTS MV I have seen since Daechwita MV and one of the best BTS MVs overall.

The MV is very cinematography , it reminds me of 00's movies in both the style of the MV and the storyline. Jungkook and Sohee done great job in acting, the MV is so hilarious and their chimestry together is amazing, shout out to actor jungkook ( I need him in a Romcom drama ASAP). And shout out to sohee I don't think another actress would be more fit to the MV than her. 



- Storyline :

Talking about the story of the MV, I would describe it as romcom, it could be summarized of it being about a guy, a hopeless romantic one that is spending the whole week trying to make up with his girlfriend conveying the message that he will love her 24/7 no matter what.

But if we dig deeper into it there are so many things going on in the MV. Jungkook in it is being a total crazy in love doing everything he can to make up with her even with the earthquake happening and the building falling, the laundrette drowning, him being hospitalozed and almost got hit by a car, to going up on the train and hanging in the sky and while thunderstorm happening, going as far as doing a funeral, he is still convincing her through it all. 

But sohee here is not better than him, she was not normal, while she seemed to be angry in first scene which I think is the beginning of their fight, to be annoyed by him following her on the train next day, to go back to arguing with him while the launderette is drowning, she is also carzy in love with how she seemed to always be on her own world in his presence, focusing only on him and ignoring her surroundings while all the disasters are happening, everyone else around her were freaking out, but she has no conscious of it at all, it is until the end of these disasters as how the water reaching the ceiling level in the launderett, just then she realized she had to go out of those places. Going into the last two days in the MV where in the 6th day when we saw her smile at the rooftop indicating that she likes how he is so down for her and going above and beyond to make up with her, to finally get back together with him in the last day in the MV. 

Really loved how they used the days format in telling the story. But yeah from those observations while it is a Romcom it is a dark one, their relationship seems to be a  continuous circle of fighting and getting back together, they absolutely crazy but at the same time you just can't not root for them to have a happy ending. 


One of the best things I liked in Seven MV is that it captured Jungkook's fun personality very well. Overall I loved everything about Seven release from the song to the MV to how smooth, cool and chill his dancing is in the choreo and to the fact they went with an interactive choreo/ performance. 




- Awards üèÜü•á :

üèÜ Funniest scene in the MV üèÜ
 
we can all agree that the funeral part takes the award, jungkook and Sohee expressions in it are hilarious.

üèÜThe scene that made my heart skip a beatüèÜ

The launderette scene have it's own fandom in it's own, we got our titanic moment with sohee and jungkook in it.

üèÜ Best style and looküèÜ

Jungkook's over all style in Seven screams 90's heartthrob and I absolutely love that on him, but if I have to chose a favorites then:

ü•áThe look he had in the launderette part I don't even need to explain why! 

ü•à The ambulance and flower look, it is [ethereal ](https://youtube.com/shorts/iaoW8HW421U?feature=share8)!

The ratings for each song will be averaged and then ranked from 1 to 345, which is the number of songs in the survey this year. The average ratings will also be used to make album rankings, collaborations rankings, etc. For an idea of what this will look like, here are previous years‚Äô results: [2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/chr8tk/the_results_from_rpopheads_ranking_of_btss_songs/) | [2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/kzbt76/results_rating_btss_discography_20132020/) | [2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/s5mdk2/results_bts_discography_ranking_20132021/)

The survey will be open for four weeks and close on **11:59 pm EST on Saturday, January 28, 2023**. A reminder will be posted 2 weeks before the deadline.

I know many Armys have been through obstacles and challenges in life and have all used BTS's music to help gain strength and persevere through them.

13697,"June 24 is a really special day for me, since 2 of the most fun and memorable songs were released simultaneously on the same day, and the artists happened to be my 2 biggest favorites!

Some fun facts about the songs:

**""Left and Right"" - Charlie Puth (ft. JungKook of BTS)**

Charlie Puth originally teased this song as a solo track in February via TikTok. Two months later however, he tweeted about a dream where BTS featured on the song (which was received by waves of excitement from fans). And while the the whole group wasn't part of the song, Charlie was able to collaborate with one of his long time admirers, Jungkook!

Jung Kook extended his record for having the biggest single debut by a South Korean soloist on Spotify with Left and Right. The song recorded 6.792 million streams in its first day of release, debuting at no. 3 on the Spotify Global chart. The song also debuted at #22 on the Billboard Hot 100.

  
**Pop - Nayeon**

I had heard someone say this about the song - ""Pop put the pop back in K-pop"", and i couldn't agree more! The song's sound was a throwback to TWICE's amazing bubblegum pop era and it created a viral dance trend its catchy hand choreography

Pop attained the #2 position on the Circle digital chart, #5 on the Billboard Japan Hot 100 and also achieved the prestigious triple crown at Inkigayo. Nayeon also became the first Korean soloist in history to debut in the top 10 of the Billboard 200 (at #7).

13782,"I was just listening to some of bts's older music, since I feel like I haven't listened to bts in awhile. I listened to ""Spine Breaker"" and I liked his voice in the chorus. Then I listened to ""War of Hormone"" and I like his voice in the ""Hello x4 tell me what you want right now"" part in the chorus. And lastly I liked his voice in ""Danger"" in his part after the chorus. (post chorus) These are just some examples.

I'm not gonna go into detail because I really don't know anything when it comes to vocals and techniques and crap like that, but I just know that I really like his voice when it sounds more ""gravelly."" like rough-ish? I like his rougher parts in bts's songs. I felt like his voice really stood out, and his parts really stood out, not that his voice still doesn't. I still love taehyungs voice no matter how he utilizes it, I liked his tone in singularity. But I would love if taehyung ever sounded like that again, and I would love for bts to make music like that again. Like their albums ""dark & wild"" and ""skool luv affair.""

[Here](https://t.co/SjPGIw3ILa) is a handy summary of all the places you can buy the album, sorted by country. 

Do you think there will be additional content/promo/merch to go with the release?

10727,"So that we're not focusing too much on what's happening in the next few *days*, why not talk about the next twelve *months*? What are your BTS predictions for 2024?

I had a pretty mixed record with my 2023 predictions ([https://www.reddit.com/r/bts7/comments/znrzoz/bts\_predictions\_for\_2023/](https://www.reddit.com/r/bts7/comments/znrzoz/bts_predictions_for_2023/)), but let's give it a shot!

* J-Hope has already confirmed that his *On the Street* OST will be six songs: [https://www.nme.com/en\_au/news/music/bts-j-hope-teases-new-music-to-come-in-2024-3471004](https://www.nme.com/en_au/news/music/bts-j-hope-teases-new-music-to-come-in-2024-3471004). It *might* be the next project to come out, depending on how long Namjoon's album takes to produce and master. But either way: I think it's going to be very fun and funky, and might sound more like *Hope World* than some of the darker, more contemplative material on *Jack in the Box*.
* Namjoon's mini album (which might even be an album by now) will come out in the first half of 2024. It's going to be a collaboration with Balming Tiger - either explicitly branded as such (""RM X Balming Tiger"") or just with a heavy role for Balming Tiger's producers behind the scenes. 
* What will Namjoon's new album sound like? My wild guess is that this might be Namjoon's *""Awaken, My Love""* \- that is, based on his performance of ""Pain Divine"" at Suga's last concert, I think we'll see more of Namjoon's singing than his rapping, with a focus on funk and soul. (Shining through the city, etc.) And given ""Pain Divine"" and Namjoon's verses in ""Sexy Nukim"", ""Smoke Sprite"" and ""Don't Ever Say Love Me"", I think there's going to be a lot of English in it.
* Jimin has obviously been working on something! He's worked with Ryan Tedder, he took a mysterious trip to Budapest, and of course there's a lot of producers he worked with for *Face* whose work didn't end up on the album. I don't think we're going to get a full album from him during his enlistment, given that *Face* was relatively brief. But I think we'll at least get a digital single or a single album. In light of Ryan Tedder's track record, it might be more straightforwardly ""pop"" than some of the darker introspective material on *Face*.
* After Jin's enlistment we might get a mini album from him in the second half of the year. Given ""Awake"", ""Epiphany"", ""Moon"" and ""The Astronaut"", I think it's a pretty good bet that it'll focus on pop rock ballads. (As much as we all love ""Super Tuna"", this will be the first post-enlistment album from a BTS member - I think they'll play it reasonably safe.)
* And finally...*I think that 2024 is the year that Ddaeng will be uploaded to streaming, maybe as a Festa 2024 gift*. There. *I said it*.

So. What do you think is coming up in 2024 for BTS?",https://www.reddit.com/r/bts7/comments/18emoo1/bts_predictions_for_2024/,BTS predictions for 2024?,bts7,t3_18emoo1,/r/bts7/comments/18emoo1/bts_predictions_for_2024/,2023-12-09 20:46:40,BTS,,

8420,"# Introduction and objective

It's time for a special /r/mashups contest for an upcoming collaborative mashup album that is currently in the works.

This album celebrates the 10th anniversary of the release of Grand Theft Auto V through mashups of songs from the Non-Stop Pop radio station found in-game. Luckily for you, music theory experts have analyzed the songs for you and have provided keys and tempos to help you out.

**For this contest, create a mashup where at least one prominent source is a** [**song played on the in-game Grand Theft Auto V Non-Stop Pop radio station**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DGaJN7WbxcPx1Cwbxp1rChcSq91PDy4h5tVaw5JnzJg/edit?usp=sharing) **(see linked workbook for a list). Bonus points for songs that are modal (Dorian, Phrygian, Mixolydian, Melodic Minor, etc. as marked on the workbook in bold). Songs that are underused, and do not have volunteers or submissions for the album, are preferred (# of Volunteers should be blank for the given song in the workbook).**

**Please keep in mind that this album will most likely not be released for at least a couple months, so you will need to keep your submission unreleased.**

I want you to do your very best. Some resources:

* Can't find stems? Extract them here: [https://mvsep.com/](https://mvsep.com/)
* [I've power ranked the best extraction algorithms here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/mashups/comments/u6ghk6/comment/i586cty/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
* [Best key detection software and databases](https://www.reddit.com/r/mashups/comments/uu5fn1/resource_best_databasessoftware_for_finding_keys/) is also linked in case you need it.

# [Submit your mashups here!](https://u.pcloud.com/#page=puplink&code=fKlkZ25zUTqgIEYfAJtaWUUVkG0E6PtN7)

# Deadlines

* **Submissions are due on Wednesday, May 24, 2023 at 8 AM EDT/1 PM BST.**
* **Voting will then proceed, and must be completed by Saturday, May 27, 2023 at 12 noon EST/5 PM GMT.**

# Guidelines

* All entries must be submitted as high quality lossy (MP3) or lossless (WAV/FLAC/ALAC) files.
* If you run into trouble submitting, please let the contest organizer know sooner rather than later.
* **To make it easier to compile, please include the title of the mashup and the artists used in the file name and/or audio tags.**
* **All tracks must be unreleased. No public submissions. Entries that are made public within the submission and voting periods may be disqualified. Do not upload previously submitted tracks to the album; these should be new.** While demos can be created prior to the contest, demos and final releases should not be made public (ex. YouTube) during the contest and before the album is released.
* There will be a voting phase from the Reddit community and a judging phase by the contest organizer, with results weighted 50/50.
* **Because these tracks will be in the running for a mashup album,** **please do your best to pay attention to source quality, key, tempo, structure, and effects like reverb**. These elements can all affect overall quality. [If you use Audacity, version 3.2 now supports real-time effects.](https://support.audacityteam.org/audio-editing/using-realtime-effects)
* Please do your best to **save your projects** and **use non-destructive/real-time effects** so that when any feedback is given on your track, it's easier to make any changes suggested.
* If you're going to use any overused songs or songs that have volunteers, make sure the mashup is executed well. There may be a limit on the number of times a specific song appears on the album.
* While it's good to challenge yourself further, don't push yourself too hard. You may get bonus points from your peers, but I'll ultimately judge on quality starting from minimum criteria.
* Whoever wins the contest **will not pick the next theme. Prizes, if any, will be announced.**
* If there are additional questions, feel free to comment within this thread. If you need track feedback, please send messages over DMs.

# TL;DR

This week's theme for the contest is **Grand Theft Auto V Non-Stop Pop Album.** Prizes, if any, to be announced.

**For this contest, create a mashup where at least one prominent source is a** [**song played on the in-game Grand Theft Auto V Non-Stop Pop radio station**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DGaJN7WbxcPx1Cwbxp1rChcSq91PDy4h5tVaw5JnzJg/edit?usp=sharing) **(see linked workbook for a list).

7713,"This is an extremely personal story that I have never told anyone before‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôve been listening to Autumn Variations a lot and it took me back to a time 8 years ago when Ed saved my life. 

In 2015 I was extremely depressed and not in a good head space. I went to an Ed concert in May with my now husband, and a couple months later my mom wanted to go to an Ed concert with me, so of course I agreed. What no one knew at the time was I was incredibly depressed, and I had a plan to end my life. I decided I would have one last ‚Äúhoorah‚Äù with my mom at the show, then the next day I would follow through with my plan. The concert was great, just like all of the others. Our seats were good, but not front row or anything. The whole time my mom was smiling and hugging me. But I knew very well my mind was set and this would be the last time I would see my mother. I Was going to end my life in the morning. I had never been more sure about anything.

That is until he started playing Photograh. To be honest, I didn‚Äôt really care for the song because I thought it was way too overplayed. But when he was singing he looked DIRECTLY AT ME when he said ‚ÄúI swear it will get easier. Remember that with every piece of ya.‚Äù And he smiled. He never looked at me before that, and never again after. I don‚Äôt know if it was that obvious that I was depressed or what. But he was staring into my soul when he sang those lyrics. I immediately broke into tears and went to the bathroom. 

The next day, instead of ending my life, I disposed of all of the supplies I had prepared and called to get myself into therapy. Since then I‚Äôve gotten married, had kids, and had some great life experiences (including 7 more Ed Sheeran concerts).lol  I literally owe my life to the man. 

I know he will never see this. But I truly hope he understands the impact not only his music has, but his presence as a human. I will never be able to express how thankful I am for him.",https://www.reddit.com/r/EdSheeran/comments/16vt0q0/ed_sheeran_saved_my_life_literally/,Ed Sheeran saved my life.

 I am one of those people who just learn song lyric easily so I know literally all his songs! I feel so good singing them. At concerts that is what I do. I get so hyped and just sing along to everything and really feel the music the way I like to.
On saturday though I felt weird because I was singing my soul out and people kept looking at me strange, and I felt embarrassed? I don‚Äôt know, I though maybe it was rude to sing? Almost no one in my section was singing, except for the big hits. Like for example, I know all the lyrics to YNMIDNY, it is one of my faves. I even know that last part that some have never heard.

3355,"I‚Äôm a South Korean myself and I recently learned the news some international fans have considered Jin ugly, which was a straight up culture shock to me. He is a member who fits the so called ‚ÄúKorean beauty standards‚Äù the most with V and jungkook coming next. 
Even South Korean antifans don‚Äôt dare to attack Jin for his physical attractiveness here. All they can say is he can‚Äôt sing or dance which I find partly true. 

Who doesn‚Äôt fit beauty standard the most here among BTS members is RM and he has been subject to being teased or bullied by Koreans for basically all his career because of that.
Jhope and sugar are at best considered mediocre, while Jimin is somewhere between mediocre and attractive.
What i‚Äôm genuinely curious about is the following:

(1) Do you think this ‚Äúattractiveness scale‚Äù can be reversed / backwards in your own country? 

(2) If (1) Is it true, does the local Beauty standards can go extreme and even consider RM is more handsome than Jin etc.

Now I have seen some kpop subs calling the news irrelevant or that ""twitter people"" are triggered again.

Honestly, this is the only sub I can go to regarding this topic, but even then I'm unsure whether or not I should have posted this. I just want to rant my frustration in a safe place and I'm unsure whether me being a Muslim and being offended is acceptable in this sub.

This was pretty difficult. Wikipedia was a big help on this as far as sequencing the Stoney tracks. I stuck to the order they were released as singles. Which makes more sense than the album order honestly. Feeling Whitney wasn't a single so I put it after the singles. For TCT I felt that it worked better in reverse so that's what I did. In general I kept features to a minimum. Also a good rule is if you have two similar sounding songs, go with the better of the two. That's why I removed take what you want. It's similar to Hollywood's Bleeding but not as good. Still a great song but not everything can make the cut. 

What are your thoughts? The good, the bad the ugly! What would you do differently?

And For people shocked I left certain tracks off... I can't fit them all. Which is both frustrating and exciting. It really forces you to prioritize and focus on the songs that mean the most to you.

I wish western celebs/artists did content like this because its so fun and refreshing to see. Korea definitely wins at content and as a kpop fan i always try to introduce my family and friends to korean media bc its just so different from what we get here.

It's gonna be a busy week for us Sheerios:

May 1st, 3rd, 5th  - eTalk will be airing Ed Sheeran week on CTV (CFTO) at 7pm ET. Ed will be interviewed on these three dates exclusively in New York where he talks about how parenthood changed his perspective on his career and influenced his music. He also talks about grief, his friendship with Taylor Swift, and his return to social media.

May 2nd- screenings of Subtract: The Visual Album in select cinemas in Leeds, London, Birmingham and Sheffield at 6.30 p.m.

May 3rd- the premiere of Ed Sheeran: The Sum Of It All, a docuseries where Ed opens the doors to his private life. All 4 episodes ( Love, Loss, Focus, Balance) will be available on release date.

All through the week- Subtract listening parties ALL OVER the world, in various venues, ranging from galleries (South Africa) to ferris wheels (Manila), record stores etc. Find the closest venue to you on his website! (The U.S. has fucking 91 locations, y'all had better DELIVERüò§üò§)

May 5th- the official drop of Subtract, on all formats. Limited 5000 or so copies of the exclusive splatter vinyl have already sold out (the ones with the 5 exclusive songs, including the mystery Flexi track- rumored to be called Peace House). As far as I know, all the music videos will also be dropped on this day.

May 5th - May 7th- the Subtract Experience Pop Up in partnership with AMEX in NYC, Dallas, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Boston.

May 6th- the beginning of the North American Leg of the Mathematics Tour in Arlington. 

May 10th- the exclusive Apple Music drop of concert footage from the intimate show at Eventim Apollo back in March.

It is important to note that while all this is happening, Sheeran will be defending his honour in court on the Thinking Out Loud case. The verdict could come out as soon as May 5th. This court case will arguably go down as one of the most important ones in pop music history, and will shape the music industry moving forward.

I really believe this could actually be one of, if not the most important week of Ed's career. Will his decision to employ authenticity in his music pay off? What will be the ramifications of the court verdict? Will his general public perception change after everything this week?

His other records were made for the GP, with promotional tactics specifically catered for the GP (intense radio tours and the like). This record was made to help him get through his shit, but has been promoted as a love letter for us, the fans, who have stuck by this long. We have a docuseries, intimate listening parties all over the world (except Africa,because...of courseüôÑüôÑ), a 5 day interview on some Canadian station, cinema screenings of the visual album in London, Apple Music exclusive showings of the private show in the UK, a partnership with American Express to promote the album's visually through Dolby Atmos, special vinyls for super fan collectors, the promised authenticity, and we've enjoyed recordings of the album in full in various intimate venues.

All these, no doubt, are marketing tactics that will only nurture the parasocial relationships we have with Ed further, whose influence will be more felt on his future records. Now, this record isn't destined for mainstream success, given its stripped back nature, and how different it is from Ed's recent works. It isn't something the GP will necessarily vibe with. If this record is to taste even the smallest mainstream success, fans might have to turn into stans and get ready to paint the whole world yellow (which I doubt can happen given that Sheerios are...normal human beings lol) . Most crucial however, is that the work should be quality (which I believe Ed will deliever). We should not allow chart success to take precedence, it's a cool bonus, but not what truly matters.  

I hope to make a post reviewing the whole album (maybe even the 9 bonus tracks).  After that, I could log off for some time just to settle with my own thoughts on the album instead of the obvious discourse online following the release of this record (flop eras and what have youüôÑüôÑ)

This album series has seen me through the highs and lows of my life and has made me connect with folks all around the world. I feel seen through his music. Let us enjoy the final chapter to this album series that has more or less defined the last decade of our lives. Here's to the next.

8454,"Firstly, a ragey and angsty tone post warning, though i see this as justifiable.

I don't what it is with companies, especially odd for the bigger ones with booking concert venues, underestimating their idol's popularity.

Basically, Red Velvet's R to V concert venues around the world excluding South Korea (atleast Asia) from my knowledge and reading of comments online, are booked in venues of around 3000 seatings. Is this really the reality that we live in? Can SM not book bigger venues? Even if the bigger stadiums/arena are booked on their 'planned day', replan it for another day, even if it's months later, atleast fans can have a better fullfilling concert to look forward to? Except maybe KCon Thailand, which they don't even attend anymore, they travel to Asia so seldom now. The least SM can give fans is a better experience and open up to more money being earned in bigger venues. SM isn't a small nugu company and Red Velvet is nowhere near being a nugu group, worst case i still don't see them incurring losts. I highly doubt the concerts won't be sold out instantly, even at bigger locations.

Are they still underestimating the girl's popularity and Asia's contributions to album sales/money earned? I forget the statistics but in another post (ktown4u stats) Asia makes up a significant % of all album sales in Kpop, rivaling even the US and Japan. So why are they not book a bigger location? Do they really think there are SO LITTLE fans here?

Now i understand for rookie groups to go to smaller venues because they are still new, i could see Aespa's 1st world tour being at smaller locations (though it really shouldn't, they are massively popular around the world). I personally went to both ITZY's showcase and world tour at smaller locations, still partly understandable on that, despite again the girls being super popular.

But for THE **RED VELVET** to return to small locations that they previously went (REDMARE)? That isn't doing the girls justice for their 9 years of hardwork and insane popularity at all. Especially with there being so little stops, everyone in the region will fly to the few locations available, increasing the competiveness for the local fans to get tickets in the small locations. Don't let me started on scalpers..

Take Singapore for example, where i'm from. Once again, they booked the Star Theatre, which the girls previous was at during REDMARE (2 years-ish into debut), many fans HATE that location (that of course isn't important) for all kind of concerts. 

To add it is 1 day only, maximum 5000 FULLY SEATING ONLY, further more they only opened up to 60% (3000) of the total seatings as the time of this posts. The Star Theatre has but a small fixed frontal stage, not extendable, with awwful sound systems, think about it. Even Singapore Expo or Suntec would be better if SM truly wanted a 'SMALL AND PRICE SAFE' locations, atleast they can extend the stages there, increasing even RV's interactions with cat1/vip/standing pene fans who are paying the ticket prices of a stadium's experience.

While NCT gets the Indoor Stadium, which even solo acts like Jackson and Kang Daniel from smaller scale companies have used. If NCT was at indoor stadium, i don't see at all why not the same for Red Velvet? If smaller companies can afford it i don't see why SM can't. Must it be groups on the scale of BTS for companies to treat their artist properly and give them what they deserve?

Which bring me to the #RedVelvetDeserveBetter hashtag that is trending on twitter now (as toxic and questionable fans there are), with several big accounts and many fans calling for bigger locations changes. But i doubt anything will be done. Especially with the concert being next month, ticketing sales being tomorrow (Singapore).

I don't know if it's the looking down of Girl Groups or asia fans/region in general but stop underestimating the cake girls and Reveluv in singapore/asia regions. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è This is so disapponting and infuritating to see. Is this the start of their 'SM 3.0' for fans?

Hopefully we can get a 3rd tour for the girls in the future, even then SM will still underestimate them.

10138,"I posted this in unpopular opinion, honestly, their songs aren't for me, while I appreciate that they have done more than songs for the society, their songs isn't for me, now, I'm not saying that bc of my opinion, their songs are overrated, but, what do you think?  


Here is the original description:  

 I think BTS's music is overrated. While I appreciate the message behind their songs and the energy of their performances, I don't think their music is particularly groundbreaking or original.

To me, BTS's music sounds like a blend of different genres and styles, without really innovating or pushing any boundaries. Their lyrics can be inspiring and relatable, but musically, I find their songs to be formulaic and predictable.

I also don't understand the hype around their visuals and choreography. While their music videos and live performances are certainly impressive, I don't think they are the best in the industry or deserve the level of praise they receive.

I know that many people love BTS and their music, and that's fine. But I feel like their success is more due to their marketing and fanbase than their actual musical talent. In my opinion, there are other artists and bands out there who are more deserving of the attention and acclaim that BTS receives.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/122k31v/deep_inhaling_bts_is_overrated/,*DEEP INHALING* BTS is overrated,teenagers,t5_2rjli,/r/teenagers/comments/122k31v/deep_inhaling_bts_is_overrated/,2023-03-26 12:06:01,BTS,0.27236435,0.065887205
10021,"TL;DR - hip hop albums are LONG and sequencing has suffered. Scroll down to see my version of FATD (very subjective; I‚Äôd encourage you to read my reasoning if you have a different opinion).

Won't get approved over at HHH but maybe yall will appreciate this
___

I feel like I‚Äôm in the minority in this day and age, but I miss the days when we would get concise & cohesive albums. It‚Äôs obvious a lot of artists are just throwing everything they have at streaming services to boost numbers, and while this is great for fans wanting to squeeze everything out of their favorite artists‚Äô discography, ALBUMS as a packaged piece of art have suffered greatly.

What constitutes an album as good? Is it the quantity of good tracks? If mediocre tracks are then added, does the overall quality decrease? Do songs need to be connected thematically, sonically, or conceptually? This is certainly up for debate, but I am of the opinion that for an album to be considered good, it needs to be considered as a whole body of work, from start to finish. Say good-bye to the album shuffle. Listening to an album from front-to-back is one of the best ways to consume music as an art.

This also means sequencing matters, which has also suffered in recent years (especially in hip-hop). Along with a high quantity of songs comes more complexity when deciding how to sequence things. Throwing 3 interludes on a long album doesn‚Äôt always help, although they are warranted when helping the flow of an album.
___

If you‚Äôve made it this far, and you‚Äôve read the title of the post, you might see where I‚Äôm headed - I‚Äôd argue Drake has been at the forefront of this movement with some of his work:

**Views** - *20 songs, 1hr 21min*

**Scorpion** - *25 songs, 1hr 30min*

**CLB** - *21 songs, 1hr 26min*

**FATD** - *23 songs, 1hr 24min*

Not only are there a large quantity of tracks, these runtimes are long. Again, my opinion: ~30min to 1hr is the sweet spot for albums; anything longer starts to blend into playlist territory (to Drake‚Äôs credit, ‚ÄúMore Life‚Äù was deemed a playlist, and you could make an argument the other pieces I listed above could be considered as such).

I‚Äôve started to consolidate super long albums into bodies of work I think would:

* Be more consumable over a shorter period of time
* Flow a bit better across the tracklist
* Highlight the highs & mitigate the lows

Thus making, what I would consider, to be a better ‚ÄúAlbum.‚Äù
___



**Additions:**

*Scary Hours 3* - I personally love all 6 of these. I‚Äôm just a sucker for rap Drake. Cole/Drake trading bars is a huge highlight, and I‚Äôm also loving the Alchemist/Conductor/Yachty production on these. This is what a lot of Drake fans have been asking for, and I‚Äôm grateful he delivered.

*Search & Rescue* - Some think it‚Äôs a snoozer, but I think the tone perfectly captures Drake‚Äôs ‚ÄúSearch‚Äù (even if it‚Äôs the same thing he‚Äôs been telling us the past 10 years). I‚Äôm also surprised it wasn‚Äôt included on the initial album, given it‚Äôs popularity.

*Unfortunately, adding these 7 songs means we had to remove a chunk -*

**Removed songs:**

*Calling For You* - I love 21‚Äôs verse & instrumental, but imo this is 3 songs in 1. Not a fan of the skit.

*Fear Of Heights* - Two rage tracks back to back was an odd choice, and not one I‚Äôm fond of. I opted for Daylight (s/o Adonis)

*IDGAF* - This is a fantastic Yeat track, but I‚Äôd argue it doesn‚Äôt belong on the album. Again, still glad this song exists.

*Bahamas Promises / Tried Our Best / Drew A Picasso* - Initially the hardest part of the album for me to get through. I love sleepytime/vibey Drake bars, but 3 in a row is difficult to stomach, especially when other tracks on the album capture the same mentality but better.

*Members Only* - The instrumental and PND‚Äôs verse are mesmerizing, and the hook is an ear-worm, but personally I get tired of the melody after some time.

*All The Parties* - Same issue as above. Same 3 note melody, across the entire song. Sucks, because I actually enjoy Sosa‚Äôs verse. 

*BBL Love* - Feels less like an interlude and more of a throwaway studio session, albeit across a smooth instrumental.

*Gently* - IMO, dancehall just doesn‚Äôt fit on this album.

*Another Late Night / Away From Home / Polar Opposites* - Again, 3 similar tracks in tone, just not much exciting going on to close out the album.

**Sequencing:**

Generally, I tried to keep the order of the initial tracks in place, while sprinkling other tracks in. Some highlights:

Disc 1~ *Virginia Beach / Amen* is probably my all-time favorite 2 opening Drake tracks. Classic relationship woes Drake, followed by an excellent feature in with Teezo. *The Shoe Fits* is a great standalone track and these 3 are fantastic openers, each have their own story/theme, and aren‚Äôt too intense. Immediately, these are followed by 2 hard hitting tracks. *7969 Santa / B.A.R.K. Interlude* is a much needed breather before jumping into the next portion of the tracklist.

Disc 2~ *Slime You Out / Search & Rescue* serve as some lead singles, and compliment each other very well thematically (themes of being used, searching for someone better, etc‚Ä¶.. but again, you can prolly say this about a lot of drake tracks). You could argue *Red Button* furthers the shot-taking that‚Äôs alluded to in *Search & Rescue*, thus placing them back-to-back highlights what Drake is trying to say (in general, i‚Äôm not a fan of the subliminal half-dissing Drake does, so anything to improve on his inability to be direct helps his themes here). *Stories About My Brother*: ‚ÄúThis is the decompress before the intermission‚Äù... quite literally a decompress from some more emotionally intense tracks, directly before *Screw The World Interlude.*

Disc 3~ If anything, this is the cruising portion of the album. Nothing too specific here, just some great tracks (and imo, 8am is an all-time great). *Evil Ways* into *You Broke My Heart* is an excellent way to close the album. We get bar-trading reflections of Cole/Drake‚Äôs careers, followed by a seemingly celebratory (sonically) track, where Drake seems to come to terms with a past relationship.

I went three days to the festival thinking about his show and looking forward to it. Then, outta nowhere, less then 12 hours before his show, he cancels because of some ‚Äúproduction issues‚Äù which is very hard to believe because you are a multimillion dollar artist that can arrange someone to produce your show in 20 minutes if you really want it.

4561,"This is why I think this album is actually very cohesive in it's theme. All these tracks have the same theme of reflecting on a girlfriend who caused a scene or was crazy in a bad moment. This is super relatable to any guy who has been on vacation or at an event before with their girl and she starts a fight or ruins the night/trip over an attitude on some dumb shit. Does this have undertones of sexism and sound a bit patronizing if you're a girl? Yes. However, it's also just a reality and frankly, we have all seen a couple fight in public before. Being that couple is a horrible feeling. To be clear, men definitely cause these types of fights as well, but Drake is sharing the male perspective.

&#x200B;

So many great lines reflecting these thoughts but my favorite line in all these tracks is from Tried Our Best:

I swear that there's a list of places that I been with you, I wanna go without you

Just so I can know what it's like to be there without havin' to argue

Swear I didn't have the discipline to leave your ass at home, you make it hard to

Basically girl math is justifying your purchases to make you feel better about it. Here's a kiwi radio host helping someone [justify their Taylor Swift tickets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGvvFg9b6Sk). I will be using this for the next BTS tour....

I thought we could expand this to BTS and army examples! It doesn't have to be exclusive to spending (but I'm guessing a lot of army examples may be)

Here's some examples:

* Army math is buying extra items to justify the shipping costs 
* Army math is remembering BTS' birthdays, but not your own friends/family members
* Army math is calculating time/comebacks by hair colour
* Army math is [everything is free if your bias pays for it](https://x.com/BE_Happier_BTS/status/1708287333378973813?s=20)
* BTS math is being so confident you're going to win BTS run and forgetting about Kim Seokjin - see the BTS mall episode where Jimin finished early and photo episode with JK smashing his board
* BTS math is raiding the pantry at ILand even thought you're a millionaire
* BTS math is betraying each other for hanwoo beef or other food (when you can easily afford it)
* BTS/army math is seeing 7 everywhere
* BTS math is having holograms and a snowgi so there's still 7 members on stage
* BTS math [is sitting on top of each other even though there's ample space](https://x.com/naija0329/status/1707228477231935581?s=20)",https://www.reddit.com/r/bts7/comments/16wx355/btsarmy_math/,BTS/Army Math,bts7,t3_16wx355,/r/bts7/comments/16wx355/btsarmy_math/,2023-10-01 09:55:52,BTS,0.09655223,0.05086999

This is my very first concert in the UK as I recently moved to here from Hong Kong. I'm still getting used to life here.

4101,"Here is my theory because I see a lot of dumb stuff like the girl on tiktok saying Drake called Universal to get paid. Dumb af and doesn‚Äôt make sense. Drake doesn‚Äôt own the rights to the song. 

BUT Drake unintentionally or intentionally did sabotage the video by playing Rack City. From what I know, you can play small snippets and I don‚Äôt think he played it long enough to get a strike. BUT I think UNIVERSAL, the distribution label that owns Rack City, because Tyga was signed to them, wanted to get paid for using the song. That‚Äôs how big labels work.

I think Bobbi brought it up to Drake (Paraphrasing) saying ‚ÄúHey you played it on our episode and now I got a strike. It‚Äôs your fault so can you help me pay it or my video gets taken down.‚Äù And Drake obviously said no because she was talking bad about Yachty saying he was weird on that one podcast.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Drizzy/comments/15xowzz/theory_time_drake_bobbi/,Theory time.

3256,"I just watched the first part of bangbangcon earlier and it was SOOOOOO AMAZING. Their performances are just unmatched. Basically I was reminded of how extensive bts' discography is and why they are my ults. I didn't even plan on watching it (had no idea that it will be airing today) - I just randomly logged into youtube, saw that there's a live in bangtantv, decided to take a peak and then boom! Plans for today were scrapped but i have no regrets. 

It was my first time seeing muster magic shop and I hope the people who got to see it live is always reminded of how lucky they are. Whalien 52, dimple, pied piper (taejin part omg), Ma City, DDAENG?!!!! PLEASE. I'll give up anything just to be there.

I also think that it's a crime that muster sowozoo didn't have a live (in person) audience. I mean just look at the stage. I'm really impressed that they were able to pull that off in the middle of covid. Their daechwita and CNS performance is a must- watch. Their So What perfomance is a personal favorite.

My main criticism is that it‚Äôs a bit repetitive and that‚Äôs mainly cause he doesn‚Äôt change his cadence much. It‚Äôs typically his regular volume voice or the louder one (ie second half of Monaco)

Even for the non-spanish speakers, listen to the vocal range in songs like No Te Hagas, Vuelve, Expl√≠cale, Netflixxx. He took more chances with his style.

4564,"I always like debating Drake topics. Being a fan since Comeback Season Ive seen the high and lows. Why I feel like he doesn't owe hip hop media anything is because HIP HOP MEDIA tried to end his career before his ascension with constant slander. Power 105 used to clown him in his take care - iyrtitl days. Hot 97 whenever they got a chance took petty shots cause he didn't want to come back for another interview. And became literal attention seekers when Meek ""exposed"" Drake.  Joe Budden was supposed to send drake a verse and never did. Then when he started his platform it was constantly about Drake and Views literally helped his podcast blow up and then it became a homies podcast about pop culture with Rory, Mal and Parks. Oh and then when Pusha T dropped Story of Adidon he quickly brought him for an interview. Attention seeking Joe. Now I would love a yearly Drake interview after he drops a album with Angie Martinez or Nore. Especially to just see how his life is, and how he feels about the album hes dropping like how he did with Elliot Wilson for CRWN in 2013. Honestly I would love J Cole to do the sit down esc talk he did with Pump with Drake. That would be dope. But he doesn't owe me that. Him being the megastar that he is, hes allowed to pick and choose who he want to be interviewed by and why should he go back to people that at the drop of the dime will turn on him again.

To me, Drake is pinnacle anything before Views but especially IFRTITL and NWTS. To me, Drake stopped being authentically vulnerable and started guarding his heart like his property and that comes across in his music. Are we ever going to get another Marvin‚Äôs Music? Too Much? 

Tell me if I‚Äôm wrong but this is 1000% his issue - he‚Äôs making music for his mood and not for THE mood.",https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/172h615/what_do_we_want_from_drake/,What do we want from Drake?,hiphopheads,t3_172h615,/r/hiphopheads/comments/172h615/what_do_we_want_from_drake/,2023-10-07 21:17:45,Drake,0.28087774,0.15713616

Drake goes in first on it and just as the beat builds and breaks, another artist takes over on it.
After that point I basically forget the rest of the song.

The mood of this song is definately more of an upbeat peppy one.

I have been to the divide tour once and the mathematics tour once, both the times I got the tickets pretty easily.

7682,"I wanted to write about this because last week at Levi's Stadium was the 2nd Ed Sheeran concert I went to (first was in 2017 during the Divide Tour when he came to the US). I want to talk about my Ed Sheeran fan origin story and how I gradually became a huge superfan of his.

When Plus came out, at that time, I was not that big on Ed Sheeran and I initially thought that he was just another solid singer-songwriter. However, during the Multiply Era, something changed. Obviously songs like Thinking Out Loud and Photograph increased my fandom of his, but you know what song actually got me hooked into Ed Sheeran first? It was All of the Stars from *The Fault In Our Stars*. I never watched the movie but I loved the song and the lyrics. Thinking Out Loud and Photograph made me a bigger fan, but what turned me from fan to die hard superfan was in 2015 when I watched Ed play Wembley Stadium during the Multiply Tour. I was astonished to see how he could manage having just himself, his guitar and his loop pedal in front of that crowd in a huge stadium. Seeing him play songs like I'm A Mess, Photograph, Bloodstream, and Tenerife Sea using the loop pedal made me love him even more. Going to his concerts during the Divide and Mathematics Tours allowed me to witness it live. Between that time period, I listed to Plus and started to love that album too. I knew the hits of that album obviously, but the other songs on there were great as well.

My experiences is probably why Multiply is my favorite album because that era turned me into a Sheerio. When did you guys start becoming big fans of Ed?",https://www.reddit.com/r/EdSheeran/comments/16ptlds/how_i_became_an_ed_sheeran_superfan/,How I became an Ed Sheeran superfan,EdSheeran,t3_16ptlds,/r/EdSheeran/comments/16ptlds/how_i_became_an_ed_sheeran_superfan/,2023-09-23 03:15:05,Ed Sheeran,0.08795626,0.046453163

of course i had ups and downs from then but late last year and the beginning of this one was probably a time period where my mental health was at its peak. but now, it‚Äôs all going down again. i feel like i felt before even starting therapy and i don‚Äôt know how to ask for help. my family thinks i‚Äôm doing all better, ive got different friends now and we rarely talk about mental health issues, and i‚Äôm not 18 yet so i can‚Äôt go to a therapist myself. i feel like self harming again and starving myself.

1547,"The vibes between Drake and his party have been off for a while. With a perturbed heart, Drake nods off to sleep early for the big mission tomorrow.

In his dreams, Drake‚Äôs deepest fears begin to emerge. The villain‚Äôs evil plan to destroy most of the world has succeeded despite their aims, and many in the group have lost family and friends. ‚ÄúI trusted you!‚Äù, the energetic short-haired girl in the group yells at him. ‚ÄúWe all trusted you, and this is where it got us. I‚Äôll‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll never forgive you for this. I should have listened to‚Ä¶ to‚Äù She trails off, tears beginning to fall. Drake can only hang his head in despair.

The gruff, older man of the group is next to speak, standing to face Drake. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never see my daughter again, because of your decisions. I can barely look you in the face anymore.‚Äù He suddenly twitches, as if to throw a punch, but then turns and walks away, slumped and broken.

Drake turns to his childhood best friend, the last of the members. ‚ÄúSh√©yaa, please don‚Äôt tell me you‚Äôve given up on me too. We‚Äôve been through so much‚Ä¶‚Äù

His friend bows his head, unwilling to meet Drake‚Äôs eyes. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Aubrey. I need to go. My mom is going to need me even more now.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go, man. I can‚Äôt do this alone‚Ä¶‚Äù

His friend hesitates, but then simply shakes his head, and is gone.

Drake collapses to the ground and wallows in silence. Suddenly, some of the villains‚Äô henchmen spot him. ‚ÄúHey, ain‚Äôt that the little hero Boss told us to take out?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah! Get ‚Äòim!‚Äù

Drake tried to defend himself, but without his friends he is easily overpowered. As the henchmen raise a massive boulder to smash Drake‚Äôs head, he screams. His scream continues as he abruptly wakes up from his dream, sitting up quickly while panting and sweat covering his face.

Hi Kpop fans! I hope it's ok to conduct academic surveys here. I'm crossposting from r/bangtan, but also posting here to reach a wider audience (hopefully).   


I'm currently in grad school (when BTS said they'd enlist in the military, I told myself I'd enlist too...in some classes) and my research partner and fellow ARMY thought it would be fun to make BTS our research topic for this term!

With that, I'd like to ask for your help in [**answering this survey**](https://forms.gle/NVTVmRHn4nVXghCX9)**.** More info on the study is disclosed in the form, but the TL:DR is we want to learn more about ARMYs' propensity to purchase things we've seen BTS using or the boys have said they use but don't endorse‚Äîthis includes Jungkook famously selling out TEAZEN's Kombucha drink, or Joonie's book recommendations being referenced in bookstores globally.

Rest assured, we will **not be collecting any contact info**‚ÄîI think Google Forms prompts you to sign in sometimes, but we don't have visibility on your email addresses! We're also only collecting demographic data because we're required to do descriptive statistics, but that's the extent of the personal data and how we'll use it. **This data collection is solely for academic purposes too.**

If you have any concerns or questions, feel free to shoot me an email, which is included in the survey form! You can also comment if you wanna discuss anything or have survey feedback :) Me and my research partner would def appreciate it! If you can, too, send to your PH moots, friends, and...fam?

2357,"Hi all, I just needed a place to get this out in the open ü´∂ I saw Ed on Saturday at Soldier Field and it was absolutely the most amazing experience of my life. I have been a huge fan since his first album in 2011 came out and I‚Äôve just loved him ever since. Every new album he has released seems to always be there for me at a prominent time in life. No one in my life seems to understand how special his music is to me but I know people in this thread feel the same way as me. I know it‚Äôs so cringy to say music saved my life, but his music really did. I was suicidal and in such a dark place for a long time and his music was the only comfort I had. Fast forward to now, I‚Äôm 26 and his music has been along with me for the ride, losing loved ones, break ups, an engagement and just so many things in life. When I listen to any song it takes me back to a memory and just makes me so emotional. During the concert, I cried, probably 3/4ths of it, I just can‚Äôt believe that it was real. I waited 12 years to see him and I still can‚Äôt believe it finally came true. I also know post concert depression is real, but nothing has ever hit me this hard. I cried as soon as the concert ended, and cried nearly the whole 4 hour drive back home. I can‚Äôt listen to his music now without crying because I feel so sad and I can‚Äôt seem to shake it. I feel so silly, because I‚Äôm 26 and I just feel so emotional over it. Has anyone else felt the same way? If so, what are you doing to shake it?!
