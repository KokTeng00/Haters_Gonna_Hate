17844,"See I was thinking about how much Joe influenced Taylor's music, especially during the Lover/Reputation eras. So, I was wondering if anyone else thought this may change the course of her career. 

I feel like if she wasn't on tour I'd have expected her to take some time away from the spotlight, and maybe took some time to work on some music as she did with reputation. However, she's got some big projects coming up (*The Tour, Re-recordings, Music Videos*), which makes the likelihood of a new album release in the next year or two unlikely (though I really hope I'm wrong lol). Like her schedule must be more than full as it is. A part of me also thinks that she may want to respect his privacy around the break-up. But, I also wouldn't be surprised if there are songs on her next album that may explain what happened (though she is in no way obliged to do this). I

There is also a part of me that still feels as the news settles the media may make the story more sinister, which I hope isn't the case, especially after the growth she's done since the Rep era especially. It makes me wonder if she may grow closer to the fandom or maybe create space again. I'm definitely leaning towards the first one, especially with the tour. I think we all know how much she at least appears to enjoy being with us. Likewise, I just have this feeling like after all this time away since the rep tour, we are almost two best friends catching up and this is giving Taylor something else to focus on.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/12hvqum/do_you_think_well_see_a_different_side_of_taylor/,Do you think we'll see a different side of Taylor with a different tone after the breakup?,TaylorSwift,t3_12hvqum,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/12hvqum/do_you_think_well_see_a_different_side_of_taylor/,2023-04-10 20:49:26,Taylor Swift,0.09351514,0.036801755,"Do you think we'll see a different side of Taylor with a different tone after the breakup?

1. Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer. Aka, don't fight with the gate guards. Bring a CLEAR bag within size limits (it's always online). 

2. Im drunk in the back of the car: aka Don't sneak in booze in your thermos/ water bottle. Sure, it'll taste great, but if you throw up on someone and ruin another swifties concert experience, remember Karma is a God. 

3. You need to Calm Down, You're being too loud. Aka, remember your volume. Your rendition of ATW is probably beautiful, but your lovely seat partner next to you didn't pay to hear ATW10MV staring you. I've been to a couple of stadium tours where I couldn't hear the singer due to the people next to me singing at the top of their lungs. Just be cautious. Sure, you may be one person, but remember it's one voice multiple by thousands

4. The worst thing that I ever did was what I did to you: aka, be nice to staff. It's not their fault a merch item ran out early. It's not their fault they can't sneak you into a meet and great or the venue early. (P.s) also try to clean up after yourself as much as possible. 

5. Driving the getaway car: aka car etiquette. Be patient with parking after the concert and plan (if you drive) a minimum of an hour to get out afterward. 

Anything else, yall remember?

Edit: Since the majority of comments was how I originally opened it, I have changed it. I did get a message last time I posted about how I didn't respect identities well enough to include everyone by saying hi. To those who have never heard of context. I never said don't drink.

I was just playing around in a music project and I was using one of the Neo-Soul packs from Splice \[[Neo Soul: The Love Experiment](https://splice.com/sounds/packs/splice-originals/so_neo_soul/samples)\] (Splice is a subscription service for royalty-free audio samples and more) and I randomly found the sample when I was looking for sounds to use.

And yeah, I can confirm that this is the one that 250 used (or whichever producer that added it). 

I pitched it down 1 semitone (-100 cents) and stretched it to fit. 

It fit like a glove.

Ngl, it's kinda on brand that he'd use a Neo-Soul pack for inspiration especially when I've always gotten that vibe from most of his productions. He seems to be pretty ""oldskool"" and it's especially felt in the chord progressions that he uses (assuming that he's the one composing every one of his productions).

For example, ETA is honestly one major Neo-Soul vibe and I'm surprised that he didn't just use the whole sample library for it (if he actually downloaded the whole library to own, he could've just picked out single samples for all I know). 

Attention also has major similar soul vibes and same with Hype Boy, and It's so interesting that Hype Boy specifically sounds like a Kaytranada song (who really embodies Neo-Soul in his music as well).

\_\_\_

Trying to recreate some of the core ideas of ETA with loops from the pack and sonically speaking, this whole sample library is just on brand with much of the music he's making. Again, assuming that his musician niche/background is Neo-Soul, RnB, Jazz, etc etc. 

I know he has this whole ""Ppongjjak"" thing but just to solely take into account his works with NewJeans, it all feels super neo-soul.

The chord progression for anyone that wants to know: 

**IVm7 - V7 - Vm7 - I7 - I7** 

**IVm7 - V7 - Vm7 - Im7** 

*(The IVm7 - V7 - Vm7 - I7 - I7 progression adds a bit of complexity to the I - vi - IV - V progression by adding the Vm7 chord and the two I7 chords which gives the progression a jazzy and soulful sound).*

\_\_\_

Chords (Bb minor):

**Ebm9 - F7 - Fm7 - Bbaug7 - Bb7**

**Ebm9 - F7 - Fm7 - Bbm9, 11**

*(The modal interchange makes the song by borrowing from parallel major mode of Bb minor as seen in Bbaug7 and Bb7. It makes everything sound so dissonant, dark and exciting. The Bbm9, 11 chord is as well used to create a sense of tension and release. The ninth and eleventh extensions add dissonance to the chord, which creates a sense of movement and anticipation same with the Bbaug7 and B7).*

9040,"We're about to see the success of the Eras Tour movie. The way she bypassed the normal studio distribution and went directly to AMC is impressing the movie industry (and worrying some entities within it). She's opened up the door to more direct-to-theaters projects, so does she have more moves in store?

I'd love to see a documentary about the making of the Eras Tour, from planning sessions and auditions, to building the stage and the process of transporting it, to logistics, rehearsals, etc. It's the biggest tour every staged, so let's see what has gone on behind the scenes to make it a reality.

Or how about this: a TSwift music video compilation on the big screen. We can see all the classics: LWYMMD, You Belong With Me, Love Story, Wildest Dreams, Anti-Hero....  I'd go see it. I think it would be great. Also, she could create a couple of new ones no one has seen yet.

Another idea is a film with all Taylor's acoustic sets from the Eras Tour.

But Debut is gonna be even more insane. Taylor has 'I'd Lie' and 'I heart ?'.

Excuse me, but HOW DOES ANYTHING TOP THAT? ""Wake up and smell a breakup"" is fantastic lyricism. As well as this, her voice is a little scratchy and new-singer esque in the first album, and I cannot wait for that to be fixed.

AS WELL AS THIS I AM GOING TO EXPLODE WHEN SHOULD'VE SAID NO TV COMES OUT.

Her performances from this are insane. I'm going down, top to bottom, from the performances (tour) I thought were best to not best. Incredibly, I think they kinda get worse with time. (Couldn't find SN)

1st- Tied, Fearless and official YouTube recording. Iconic. Iconic. Throw that guitar and hit Drew in the face! (I know, one of the backup dudes caught it). As well as this, ripping that hoodie off was excessive drama queen energy but I love it. The theatrics that made original so iconic are equaled in the energy the Fearless tour, and that backup singer fiddler girl who sounds amazing. The crowd was *feeling it*.

2nd- Reputation. I used to say this was my favourite but it's got Bad Blood in it, so... less hoodie ripping and more Bad Blood. I do love the rock sound though (: + credit to that random trapeze dude.

3rd- Red. She's just playing the guitar and does this weird head tilt thing. Gotta love her energy though. She also doesn't do one of the notes?

4th- 1989. Having fireworks popping in the background makes it hilarious. She seems happy too.

5th- Eras. I'm sorry but you can't hear Taylor and not have her dancing around and doing absolutely *insane* shit on stage kind of takes away from what made the Fearless, Reputation and original performance so iconic.

20817,"This year I've been more exposed to Taylor Swift and I have started becoming more invested in her. I recently listened to most of the songs from her debut album (not all of them, though) and in the summer, I was obsessed with Anti-Hero. I also know some others of her most popular songs, like Shake It Off, Look What You Made Me Do, Cruel Summer etc but all-in-all I am not a hardcore fan. 

After all the hype around the Eras Tour, I decided to go and watch the movie at the cinema by myself because no one is interested in going with me (my friends are not fans of her music). I am really curious to see how the visuals will be like, how the movie will portray Taylor and I'd like to listen to more of the songs she has sung. 

Should I listen to more of her songs or just go blindly? I have watched some videos on the internet and I basically know what the visuals in the tour are like, how people react but I'd like to experience this on the big screen.

The problem is that unfortunately, I feel like I fish out of water in case I interact with Swifties...I don't think that Taylor is extremely popular where I live (in Greece), like she is known, but not many people listen to her but there are still many people who are fans and will watch the film. I don't have bracelets, I don't know her entire catalogue or many things about her and if someone asks me something, it'll be a little bit awkward...

The problem is that unfortunately, I feel like I fish out of water in case I interact with Swifties...I don't think that Taylor is extremely popular where I live (in Greece), like she is known, but not many people listen to her but there are still many people who are fans and will watch the film. I don't have bracelets, I don't know her entire catalogue or many things about her and if someone asks me something, it'll be a little bit awkward...

Anyway, I'm excited and curious about the film and I hope I'll enjoy my time at the cinema!",hi non considers go cinema watch era tour film preparation expectation hae year ie expo hae start become inest recently listen song debut album though summer ob antihero also know others popular song like shake look make cruel summer etc allinall hardcore fan hype around era tour decid go watch moie cinema one interest go friend fan music really curious see isuals like moie portray id like listen song sung listen song go blindly hae watch ideos internet basically know isuals tour like people react id like experience big screen problem unfortunately feel like fish water case interact si dont think extremely popular lie greece like know many people listen still many people fan watch film dont hae bracelet dont know entire catalogue many thing someone asks something itll little bit awkward anyway im excit curious film hope ill enjoy time cinema,1,"Concert and Ticket Issues: Discussions about buying, selling, and handling concert tickets, including resale, shipping, and general availability."

So my has two sons they around 17 and 19 (let’s call them X and Y) yrs old  I have never really interacted  with  them but yesterday evening as I was returning home from my friends house ( I was alone ) I saw them both standing (with other boys prolly of their school)  on crossing  of 2 streets ahead of our neighbourhood I just didn’t thought much of it  .
I walked ahead I saw a girl walking past them and her EarPod maybe fell down in front of them  and she kinda bent down to pick up she was quick yk but Y had the audacity to say “ you wanna sw@llow what a ho3 you are “  then they all started laughing then they grabbed her phone and saw what she was listening to  ( yea she was listening to ts)    Then said “ ho3 listening to a ho3 “poor girl just at  froze there . ( at this point I was literally standing and staring at them still they had no shame ) then X recognised me and whispered something in Y ear . I went ahead and snatched the phone from Y hand and that girl just took it from me and she vanished . I said “ I’m gonna tell your parents about what you did “ then he kinda tried to startle me saying no you wont 
I just got so pissed I punched Y on his  face 
( Then all his friends ran away lol . ) 
I told them to come with me to go to their mom 
At their home
It’s all intense after I told their parents what their son did and she said 
“ they are teenage boys yk the harmones of boys are different , anyway it’s the girls fault why she was seeking attention going in front of young boys I bet she was wearing something slutty too 💀” I wanted to give her a chowk slam then I took a deep breath and tried to  make them understand how it was their fault then the X said 
“ all of you girls are ho3 Thats what Andrew Tate says now you need to  fuxk off “ 
*Sigh*
Then I said I’m calling police (which( i should have done earlier but that girl was gone and I thought of giving these “boys “ a chance and thought telling their mother would embarrass them and they will learn a lesson butt— )
Their father told me they would charge me with assault of 19 yr old 💀 bruh . And told me to let go but I still called the police and 
We told them everything 
Little forward
They said I didn’t have enough evidence nor did I had the victims id 
So the case would be discarded anyways 
 
In the station I saw their father telling the officer “ yk boyz have young blood it’s how they learn how to deal with girls and yk it’s a generation of playboyzz” and they both laughed like creeps . 
 

 After this traumatic night I came home and thought of this lyric “ boyz will be boys then where are the wise men darling I’m scared “

( Then all his friends ran away lol . ) 
I told them to come with me to go to their mom 
At their home
It’s all intense after I told their parents what their son did and she said 
“ they are teenage boys yk the harmones of boys are different , anyway it’s the girls fault why she was seeking attention going in front of young boys I bet she was wearing something slutty too 💀” I wanted to give her a chowk slam then I took a deep breath and tried to  make them understand how it was their fault then the X said 
“ all of you girls are ho3 Thats what Andrew Tate says now you need to  fuxk off “ 
*Sigh*
Then I said I’m calling police (which( i should have done earlier but that girl was gone and I thought of giving these “boys “ a chance and thought telling their mother would embarrass them and they will learn a lesson butt— )
Their father told me they would charge me with assault of 19 yr old 💀 bruh . And told me to let go but I still called the police and 
We told them everything 
Little forward
They said I didn’t have enough evidence nor did I had the victims id 
So the case would be discarded anyways 
 
In the station I saw their father telling the officer “ yk boyz have young blood it’s how they learn how to deal with girls and yk it’s a generation of playboyzz” and they both laughed like creeps . 
 

 After this traumatic night I came home and thought of this lyric “ boyz will be boys then where are the wise men darling I’m scared “

1416,"So I’m my opinion Question…? Is about Karlie, I was listening to it today and I know that people have already pointed this out but I thought that I should bring them up again, so here’s why I think that it is about Karlie:

-“Have you ever have someone kissed you in a crowded room”, in my mind that’s an obvious reference to kissgate and how they “kissed” in a concert full of people.

-“Did you leave your house in the middle of the night?”, I think that’s a reference on how Taylor always used to go to Karlie’s NYC apartment almost everyday in the 1989 era.

-“Did you wish you put up more of a fight?”, I think this makes a reference on how in Maroon (that’s it’s also rumored to be about Karlie) she says “and I lost you, the one I was dancing with, in New York”, and it’s about their “break up” and how someone could’ve fought harder to keep the other one.

14467,"Hello! I’m hoping an Argentinian Swiftie can take a look at this 1989 Deluxe CD I bought from discogs and let me know if it seems real or not? 

I bought the Target Deluxe CD back in 2014 on release day, and this new CD that just came has some differences that I’m curious about in regards to authenticity.

The Polaroids themselves are glossy compared to my matte ones from the Target edition. Also, they aren’t a consecutive set. The numbers are: 3, 7, 8, 10, 13, 15, 16, 20, 28, 29, 56, 63, and 64. 

Going inside the CD, the lyric booklet is also glossy and thick paper compared to the Target that is matte, thinner paper. 

I mostly bought this CD for the CD itself, so I really want to be sure it’s not counterfeit. Does anybody know anything about the different versions of the Polaroid sets country to country? (This is might be the easiest way to tell if the CD is real or not. It was shrink wrapped upon delivery.) 

I know it’s been posted a few times in regards to Canadian, Australian, European, etc versions; but I’ve never seen anyone post about an Argentinian version. Did it exist?

At the risk of sounding like an overbearing parent, your mods ask that you PLEASE use your own discretion when scheduling a meetup. Vegas is a very busy city with lots of wild characters. Tips to stay safe:

1. Meet in a public place.
2. Do not give out your hotel or room number.
3. Be cautious of who you add on some social media. Some social media (like Snapchat's Snapmap) can share your location to friends.
4. Always keep your drink(s) in your line-of-sight and don't take drinks (or anything else-- it's Vegas after all) from someone you just met, unless you see them get it from the bar.

At the risk of sounding like an overbearing parent, your mods ask that you PLEASE use your own discretion when scheduling a meetup. Vegas is a very busy city with lots of wild characters. Tips to stay safe:

1. Meet in a public place.
2. Do not give out your hotel or room number.
3. Be cautious of who you add on some social media. Some social media (like Snapchat's Snapmap) can share your location to friends.
4. Always keep your drink(s) in your line-of-sight and don't take drinks (or anything else-- it's Vegas after all) from someone you just met, unless you see them get it from the bar.

We hope to see r/Adele Daydreamers make lifelong friends at these concerts! Have fun and be safe!

The first time I heard this and saw the lyrics on Spotify, it had the basement lyrics which is what it sounds like she’s saying to me and fits the whole theme of the song. I recently noticed that the lyrics were changed on Spotify &amp; it doesn’t even sound like she is saying amazement or patience. This made me uncomfortable to the point I went to SZA’s official lyric video &amp; it’s amazement?? I’m so weirded out for some reason.

28868,"I think that it goes without saying that Taylor's lead singles are usually not the best songs on their respective albums. However, I do think that they work really well as lead singles. For a song to be a successful singer, it needs to be singable after 1 or 2 times. for the average listener. The chorus needs to be really simple so that it gets stuck in people's heads. And it needs to have around a 3:30 length so it doesn't feel like the song goes on forever. It'll make people want to listen to it more. That's why songs like Love Story, We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together, Shake It Off, Look What You Made Me Do, ME!, Willow, and Anti-Hero work really well as lead singles. After two listens, the average listener can sing along to at the very least, the chorus. The themes also have to be very easy to comprehend and relatable to many people.
From there, she can get people hooked on the album with songs like You Belong With Me, Blank Space, I Knew You Were Trouble, ...Ready For It?, and Lover work as supporting singles. They're still very singable songs but may need an extra listen or two to really sing along to it. And they can easily be enjoyed by casual listeners. 
There's also a pattern for a lot of single chronology. You don't want to have singles back to back that sound very similar. It's why Mine was the lead single of Speak Now followed by Back To December. One is a very upbeat song about the person you hope to spend the rest of your life with and the other is about owning up to your mistakes and admitting you screwed up your relationship. These are two contrasting themes, showing diversity in Taylor's songwriting that average listeners wouldn't see if, say, Sparks Fly followed Mine as the second single. 
If Taylor was just marketing an album to Swifties, then chances are every lead single would be her favorite song on the album, or the one she thinks Swifties would like the most. If that were the case, All Too Well would've been the lead single on Red. But it probably wouldn't have been successful because it's over 5 minutes long and it's themes are extremely deep. And the song is very personal to her, especially the 10 minute version. It would target a very very specific audience: Swifties and people going through a really intense breakup. 
Personally I think that the lead singles on each of her albums were good choices. Now if we're talking about supporting singles, then I'd make the argument that Cruel Summer, Karma, Call It What You Want, All Too Well, Nothing New, and Mr. Perfectly Fine should've been official singles.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/10q4xtu/taylors_singles_logic/,Taylor's singles logic,TaylorSwift,t3_10q4xtu,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/10q4xtu/taylors_singles_logic/,2023-01-31 17:27:43,Taylor Swift,0.11347008,0.05140001,"Taylor's singles logic I think that it goes without saying that Taylor's lead singles are usually not the best songs on their respective albums.

The obvious example here would be the folklore trilogy. How the mentions of the cardigan, the cobblestones, the car, ""when you are young they assume you know nothing"" vs. ""i'm only 17 i don't know anything""... show that they all tell the same story.

Some of my favorite less glaringly obvious ones are:

Her [*MySpace* profiles](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/12a8dub/used_the_wayback_machine_to_check_out_taylors_old/)  mention that she's 5'11 (the line about how she doesn't like wearing heels because she's 'afraid of falling in front of large groups of people' is cute now that she rocks them and routinely performs in front of enormous crowds), and early articles follow this, like [*Entertainment Weekly*](https://ew.com/article/2008/02/05/taylor-swifts-road-fame/) 2008 profile:

>It's because I knew I could never feel the kind of rejection that I felt in middle school. Because in the music industry, if they're gonna say no to you, at least they're gonna be polite about it."" (Being unusually tall for her age, or any age—she's now 5'11"", without her cowboy boot heels—may have made her more of a junior high outcast.)

Around the time of *Red* though, there's interviews where she says she's 5'10, like with [*Vanity Fair*](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2013/04/taylor-swift-cover-story):

>“I’m not actively looking, because you don’t find anything when you’re looking for it, but I think what I would mostly be looking for in a guy … is someone who sees me in my actual dimensions: 23 years old, five-foot-ten...

Then of course there's that [quote from *People*](https://people.com/style/taylor-swifts-short-haircut-was-six-months-in-the-making-shes-still-getting-taller-and-five-more-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-star/) (crazy that this is already eight years ago!):

>“I grew an inch [in the past year], which means I’m the latest developing human in the world.” 

So, for people who've been lucky enough to meet her, which would you say is correct?

28392,"*Disclaimer: I am an immunocompromised Swiftie dating a cancer survivor. I am not a doctor or an epidemiologist, but unfortunately have had to stay very up-to-date to keep myself and my partner safe. If you are not open to the idea of taking COVID precautions, please leave this post now. I am not going to debate anyone in the comments, and I request that mods do not remove this as this information is important for folks who are trying to stay safe. I will update this post regularly, so feel free to bookmark and revisit before your tour date!*

**There is a 100% chance that there will be folks who are COVID positive and contagious at the tour. There is also a 100% chance that there are folks at the tour who are immunocompromised, or who have a loved one that is immunocompromised.** Hell, this is true just because *Taylor* is at the tour. As you’re probably aware, her mom Andrea is a [cancer survivor](https://www.biography.com/musicians/taylor-swift-mom-cancer-battle) herself. [Andrea wore a mask to opening weekend](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRvM3FdT/). Taylor [wears a mask behind the scenes](https://youtu.be/pCH19_8E4Hw?t=22).

**If you’ve never had COVID, you don’t want it. If you have had COVID, you don’t want it again.** Research shows that COVID affects [every part of the body](https://www.10news.com/news/coronavirus/in-depth-study-finds-covid-infects-entire-body-not-just-lungs), and fighting off a COVID infection can make you [more susceptible to other sicknesses, like colds or flus](https://theconversation.com/ive-had-covid-and-am-constantly-getting-colds-did-covid-harm-my-immune-system-am-i-now-at-risk-of-other-infectious-diseases-188899). Additionally, your risks for hospitalization, death, further illness, and Long COVID [increases with each infection](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/do-repeat-covid-infections-increase-the-risk-of-severe-disease-or-long-covid/). The best way to avoid this is to avoid COVID entirely. The worst thing in the world would be getting COVID before or at the tour, and having your memory of this amazing event compromised because you got sick immediately before/after. It's possible to suffer from [memory lapses even with mild COVID](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/brain-fog-memory-and-attention-after-covid-19-202203172707#:~:text=Less%20obvious%20lapses%20in%20memory,mild%20case%20of%20COVID%2D19.).

**Consider that you or your loved ones may also fall under the ""high risk"" category.** I did not consider myself in this category before COVID, but the [definition of high risk is quite broad](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html#immunocompromised) - it includes people who have mental health conditions, diabetes, people who are pregnant, people who smoke or used to smoke, people who are overweight or physically inactive, people who are [anemic](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.26444), and more.

**Even if your venue is outdoors, you can still spread and catch COVID.** COVID is highly transmissible and [can still spread outdoors, especially in large crowds](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2022/07/01/1109444481/coronavirus-faq-can-i-get-covid-outdoors-with-printable-poster-on-how-to-cut-ris). Extra especially when everyone is singing/screaming! Additionally, you can spread/catch COVID while walking inside the stadium, using the restrooms, waiting in line, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

**You can dramatically reduce your risk of getting or spreading COVID by following these tips:**

There is no “magic bullet” for avoiding COVID, so we use the “[**Swiss Cheese model**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/carminegallo/2020/12/10/the-virologist-who-created-a-swiss-cheese-metaphor-to-explain-the-pandemic-has-a-message-for-educators/?sh=22ddb7ca6335)” - each mitigation effort is a reduction of your likelihood of getting or spreading COVID. Consider incorporating some or all of these tips to reduce your likelihood of getting/spreading COVID dramatically.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Make sure you are up-to-date with your vaccinations.** Get the primary series of vaccines, and make sure you have also gotten the updated [bivalent vaccine.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html) However, remember that vaccines do not prevent you from getting or spreading COVID, and [vaccines do NOT dramatically reduce your risk of Long COVID or long term health symptoms](https://www.salon.com/2022/06/01/vaccines-reduce-risk-of-long-by-just-15-percent-study-finds), only hospitalization/death while you are sick with COVID.
* **1-2 weeks before your tour date, reduce your activities and wear a high-quality, well-fitting mask (N95 or KN95) in public places.** If you don’t get COVID, you can’t spread COVID! Avoid large indoor gatherings and avoid eating and drinking in restaurants or bars in the days leading up to your tour date. Research outdoor bars, restaurants, and beer gardens in the city you're visiting. It would suck to be sick for the concert! It’s 3 hours long and that just sounds miserable.
* **Wear a high-quality, well-fitting mask on the plane and in the airport while you are en route to and from the concert.** Again, if you don’t get COVID, you can’t spread COVID. There’s almost a 100% chance that [someone on your plane to or from the concert](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2023/01/08/covid-19-coronavirus-found-in-samples-from-28-of-29-airplane-flights/?sh=674d08b7a24b) has COVID.
* **Take a rapid test the day of, before you go to the concert.** If you test positive and it is at all possible for you to skip the concert (because you planned to go to multiple tour dates, or you are able to trade your tickets for a new date), then stay home. If not, *make sure that you and your group wear a well-fitted, high quality mask for the duration of the concert and anytime you are around others*. Consider informing those around you so that they can choose to mask up as well.
* **If you feel any symptoms of sickness at all, regardless of your test result, mask up for the concert.** At-home COVID tests are not always accurate, so if you are feeling sick then wear a mask to avoid spreading any sickness (flu, cold, COVID) to others.
* **Wear a high quality and well fitting mask for the duration of the concert, even if you test negative and feel fine.** Wearing a mask helps those of us who are immunocompromised or who have immunocompromised loved ones feel much safer. If everyone around us is wearing a mask, then we are safer if we need to remove a mask to take a drink and eat something, or if the fit of our mask isn’t ideal. Of course, it also protects *you* in case someone around you is positive and contagious. Two-way masking is much better than one-way masking, but one-way masking [is effective](https://www.self.com/story/wearing-a-mask-effective-if-nobody-else-is). Bring multiples, as you might need to replace yours (sweat, tears, aggressive singing or screaming, etc.) or you may want to share some with those around you.
* **If someone in your section is wearing a mask, consider wearing one too.** For the most part, those of us who still mask are doing so because we are immunocompromised or have a loved one who is immunocompromised. The kindest, most amazing thing that anyone can do for us is to mask up when they see that we are masking. You would make an INSTANT friend from me if you masked up because I was sitting next to you! 
* **Test again 2-5 days after the tour. If you test positive, post your test and your tour date/section/seat number online.** This will allow people to know if they have had a close contact, so that they can test too and isolate from vulnerable loved ones if needed. You can create a new account to share the test anonymously. Make sure to use keywords like ""Taylor Swift"" ""Era's Tour"" ""Covid"" ""Positive"" so people can find your post. 
* **Keep reduced/isolated/COVID safe activities before and *after* the concert.** Given the size of the stadium and the fact that a concert involves a lot of singing/screaming, this is a high risk event for getting &amp; spreading COVID. Before your trip, research and stick to outdoor venues for food and drinks (beer gardens, patios, etc.) and mask up when you are indoors in public places/museums/hotels/Ubers/Lyfts after the concert so you can avoid spreading anything afterwards too. Mask up on any planes/trains/buses you take to get back home. If you have vulnerable loved ones, let them know about your trip/concert and continue to mask around them or avoid in-person contact with them for 1-2 weeks.
* **Share this post to encourage others to mask. If you are a content creator, there is extra responsibility from you.** Getting this message out is important. I know there are many content creators in this sub who post a lot about Taylor Swift and the tour. You are a role model and someone who can influence the decisions of others. Please do not ignore the fact that COVID is still a thing when you post about attending the tour, and especially if you attend yourself. 

&amp;#x200B;


**If you wear a mask to the Eras Tour, just know** **that** ***you are my hero.*** I have tickets to the tour but I am not sure if I will be able to go because I’m not sure I can effectively mitigate my risk. But my tour date isn’t for a couple of months - if I see that the concerts are getting safer because people are masking, it will be easier for me to make the decision to go.  **Immunocompromised Swifties are Swifties too.** So, if you mask, THANK YOU. You bet I will if I go, because **you can still make the whole place shimmer in a mask** 😷

* **If you feel any symptoms of sickness at all, regardless of your test result, mask up for the concert.** At-home COVID tests are not always accurate, so if you are feeling sick then wear a mask to avoid spreading any sickness (flu, cold, COVID) to others.
* **Wear a high quality and well fitting mask for the duration of the concert, even if you test negative and feel fine.** Wearing a mask helps those of us who are immunocompromised or who have immunocompromised loved ones feel much safer. If everyone around us is wearing a mask, then we are safer if we need to remove a mask to take a drink and eat something, or if the fit of our mask isn’t ideal. Of course, it also protects *you* in case someone around you is positive and contagious. Two-way masking is much better than one-way masking, but one-way masking [is effective]( Bring multiples, as you might need to replace yours (sweat, tears, aggressive singing or screaming, etc.) or you may want to share some with those around you.
* **If someone in your section is wearing a mask, consider wearing one too.** For the most part, those of us who still mask are doing so because we are immunocompromised or have a loved one who is immunocompromised. The kindest, most amazing thing that anyone can do for us is to mask up when they see that we are masking. You would make an INSTANT friend from me if you masked up because I was sitting next to you! 
* **Test again 2-5 days after the tour. If you test positive, post your test and your tour date/section/seat number online.** This will allow people to know if they have had a close contact, so that they can test too and isolate from vulnerable loved ones if needed. You can create a new account to share the test anonymously. Make sure to use keywords like ""Taylor Swift"" ""Era's Tour"" ""Covid"" ""Positive"" so people can find your post. 
* **Keep reduced/isolated/COVID safe activities before and *after* the concert.** Given the size of the stadium and the fact that a concert involves a lot of singing/screaming, this is a high risk event for getting &amp; spreading COVID. Before your trip, research and stick to outdoor venues for food and drinks (beer gardens, patios, etc.) and mask up when you are indoors in public places/museums/hotels/Ubers/Lyfts after the concert so you can avoid spreading anything afterwards too. Mask up on any planes/trains/buses you take to get back home. If you have vulnerable loved ones, let them know about your trip/concert and continue to mask around them or avoid in-person contact with them for 1-2 weeks.
* **Share this post to encourage others to mask. If you are a content creator, there is extra responsibility from you.** Getting this message out is important. I know there are many content creators in this sub who post a lot about Taylor Swift and the tour. You are a role model and someone who can influence the decisions of others. Please do not ignore the fact that COVID is still a thing when you post about attending the tour, and especially if you attend yourself.

**If you wear a mask to the Eras Tour, just know** **that** ***you are my hero.*** I have tickets to the tour but I am not sure if I will be able to go because I’m not sure I can effectively mitigate my risk. But my tour date isn’t for a couple of months - if I see that the concerts are getting safer because people are masking, it will be easier for me to make the decision to go.  **Immunocompromised Swifties are Swifties too.** So, if you mask, THANK YOU. You bet I will if I go, because **you can still make the whole place shimmer in a mask** 😷

It went OOS on Taylor's site shortly after I posted, and then went OOS on Target's site as well as of a few days ago. However, over the last 48 hours or so, something strange happened - not only were the pink/blue Lover and Target Exclusive Evermore 2LPs OOS on Target's site, **but the pages were removed entirely.**

The same goes for Taylor's 1989 TV vinyl 2LPs, the red Folklore 2LP, and even her CDs... everything was removed from the Target site: 

* [Link to one of the Target Exclusive CDs, which looks like every other Target X Taylor item link](https://www.target.com/p/taylor-swift-lover-target-exclusive-deluxe-version-3-cd/-/A-76577857)
* [Target's TS page, which is blank, spare some distributed titles](https://www.target.com/c/taylor-swift/vinyl/-/N-54u4cZvevia)

I did some digging, and heard through a connection that UMG and Target have ended a years-long contract to have Exclusive records at Target in-store and online. This applies to Taylor Swift albums as well as other UMG artists, like [Lana Del Rey](https://www.target.com/p/lana-del-rey-8220-did-you-know-that-there-8217-s-a-tunnel-under-ocean-blvd-8221-target-exclusive-vinyl/-/A-88189466). 

**What does this mean for us?** Well, I'd recommend buying any Target Exclusives you've been holding off on buying **at Target in-store**. I went to four stores yesterday and picked up red Folklore, the three exclusive 1989 TV CDs, an extra Lover pink/blue and the exclusive Folklore, Fearless TV and Midnights CDs; there's still a decent supply of the CDs, but exclusive vinyl LPs are running thin.

As we know, once Taylor Swift merch goes OOS everywhere, prices skyrocket, so don't sleep any longer. If you don't have access to a Target/your store has been cleared out, go a site like eBay and buy something for which the seller is barely breaking even (e.g. the Target Tangerine 1989 TV, the exclusive 1989 TV CDs, which are still cheap).

18500,"So, the blame for the breakup has clearly been shifted to Joe recently by the community, but as many have pointed out - Taylor doesn't seem to really be trying to put blame on any one specific thing. 

It is cartoonish and utterly unrealistic to assume that over the course of 6 years the topic of marriage was never discussed vocally, that Joe simply didn't get the hint and Taylor simply couldn't open her mouth and say something. 

What I believe to far more likely, is that they have, and Joe is just a person who views marriage as antiquated and useless. For normal women marriage is a form of security, but it wouldn't really be that necessary for Taylor. Unable to give good arguments as to why she needs a piece of paper to prove they love each other she pretended to accept it, but in reality she did want to be married despite knowing it isnt a 100% rational desire. I think this is what ""argumentative, antithetical dream girl"" refers to. Perhaps she did explain that as a public persona she needs the marriage, but it was just against Joes' principles to do it just for the sake of the public eye. I believe this is what the lines in LH and the ""people pleaser"" one point out to. She agrees with Joe's rational, but she still needed the marriage to clear her name, prove people wrong and appear better in the eyes of media. She wanted a public marriage like Blake and Ryan's, she needs to be close to the fans. She would rather have a mess, like the current one, where she goes back to not caring, than live a quiet, mundane life. In the end, if she thought that Joe is not paying enough attention to her, what would have a marriage fixed? Why would she want to continue the relationship in the first place if there was another issue?

Now, it is possible that one, the other, or both of them have cheated. If Taylor has had doubts in the beginning and cheated, maybe he did too. Or she felt guilty, and when he did propose, she rejected and Joe changed his view on marriage, not wanting to go through it again, despite clearing things out (""keeping score, etc""). Maybe he was waiting for until after the tour has ended and they both saw it just wasn't going to work out. 

We can only speculate, but the ""he didn't get the hint and she couldn't just speak"" interpretation is kinda silly.

Edit: I feel like ""the final blow"" and the lack of ""for you"" in the latter choruses when she sings ""my hart wont start anymore"" hints to her finally having decided to stop caring and hoping so much and just try to be happy.

1710,"First off, so sorry this is so long, i was cursed with the burden of never meeting word counts due to always writing too much so stay (stay stay) with me, there’s a micro theory at the end.

The first part is tenuous but every time i hear the “(okay!)” I feel like it’s masking the final syllable that should be there. Which is the “ess” in Princess. Now that’s just how I feel it’s off sonically but the order of author/muse is also strange to me and it’s the main reason i consider it Gaylor evidence.

Normally when referencing two people you would describe them respectively. If you read f/f or m/m romance you probably unconsciously rely on this convention due to the constant clashing of matching pronouns in most scenes, esp physical scenes in the nsfw vicinity.

Now looking at the song: “It’s you(1) and me(2) / there’s nothing like this / miss Americana(1) and the Heartbreak Prince(2).

Taylor’s telling us that she isn’t Miss Americana. She’s the Heartbreak Prince(ss). The only thing indicating she’s MA is the use of “prince” but that part has felt out of place to me well before i dived into Gaylore which is why I feel the same-pronoun convention works.

I also think this is why it became the new name of the documentary (i believe it was originally Is It Cool That I Said All That, correct me if I’m misremembering)  It solidified in fans’ minds that she was Miss Americana after the failed coming out. 

I have a micro-unsupported theory that it WAS originally recorded as heartbreak princess and the production on the “(okay!)” was enhanced to hide the missing syllable before it made it to album release, same as AOTG being cut/London Boy being rushed to make it on the album.

**I Wish You Would (Taylor's Version)**

After last round's complete landslide, this round was the closest one yet, with I Wish You Would having to run and hide after receiving only *one* more vote than today's second place song. While not generally hated, this early Swift and Antonoff collab isn't often discussed, so it's not surprising to see you hang up the phone on it before we get down to the real fan favorites. To you all, this song's in the past, and you're driving straight ahead (to the next round).

20976,"Do any Swifites listen to the Big Picture on the Ringer podcast network? It is a film podcast. I love this show so much, I never miss an episode, but I have to say their episode on the Era's movie was really clouded in judgement for Taylor and mentioned little substantial about the construction of the film and the way it effects the industry - which they are usually so good at articulating. I think when people critique the music or art you like it is hard not to take it personally because usually there is a personal connection to that thing so I tried hard to give them the benefit of the doubt and temper my gaze, but there was absolutely no convincing Sean, the host, that Taylor was anything but a calculated, exploitive entity - even using the exact language that Taylor has described in Miss America and interviews about the difference between clever and conniving. He scoffed at the idea that Taylor's name could be in the same conversation as songwriting greats. The whole thing felt like a 2014 flashback.

I am not saying if you don't like Taylor you are wrong, I know plenty of people my age, in their twenties, who have probably never listened to a whole album and have no interest in doing so and that is fine. It is even fine if you listen to it and decide it is not for me, but Sean's approach was so close minded. It was really disappointing because I usually follow the recommendations from this show, not because I trust them blindly, but we tend to have similar takes on films and the industry. This episode was a hard listen.

I would love to know if anyone on here listen's to this podcast and had a similar or different reaction or perhaps other film podcasts that have covered the Eras Movie.

28545,"Taylor’s [shoes in this outfit](https://taylorswiftstyle.com/post/735923645866754048) immediately caught my attention as potential Easter egg bookends calling back to Lover and Midnights, and I’m dying to know what everyone else here thinks. 

We have Lover, all about Taylor’s time in London post-reputation, and even has the quintessential London bop, London Boy. Big Ben is featured in the heel of the left shoe. The Eras Tour has a pink, purple, and orange set with the famous Cornelia Street-esque arches. And we start the show saying, “It’s been a long time coming.”

We see the same arches during Midnights in an unmissable parallel that bookends the show. And it makes sense: Lover is Taylor’s first owned studio album and Midnights is the last that’s not a re-record. But Midnights also features the song Paris—a song about being so in love that you feel as if you’re alone with your lover in the most romantic city in the world… almost like the entirety of the Lover diaries. And Paris, the Eiffel Tower, is featured in the right heel of this shoe. And we end the show with, “It’s coming back around,” via Karma, which could just be a cute bookend, but goes to this sister album theory. 

On top of that, Taylor’s coat and skirt combo on this night are Stella McCartney. Taylor famously [partnered](https://store.taylorswift.com/pages/taylor-stella-lookbook) with Stella during the Lover era. Stella even received a shoutout in the song London Boy: Stick with me, I’m your queen / Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney. Taylor has worn much more Stella McCartney this year, but notably, since she liked the tweet about Paul and Linda (see below), she has [only worn Stella](https://taylorswiftstyle.com/tagged/stella%20mccartney) in her street style. 

And Taylor has enjoyed a friendship with Paul McCartney, Stella’s father, that has recently been in the spotlight because of Taylor’s recent [hint](https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/was-taylor-swifts-sweet-nothing-inspired-by-paul-mccartney/) that Sweet Nothing is about Paul and his wife, which means Midnights features yet another McCartney shoutout (and perhaps another collaborator if William Bowery is Paul himself).

I actually like these songs but I don't think they fit with the supposed theme of the album at all. They're not about relationships, friendship, or family -- but, as it so happens, they're all political/social commentary.

What if, instead of putting them on *Lover*, Taylor had released these songs along with Only the Young as a 4-song EP? Would it make people hate these songs less? Since one of the most common criticisms of *Lover* is its length, would it be better received without those 3–4 tracks?

734,"**Cine21:** *NewJeans debuted with global attention and their 1st EP 《New Jeans》 was an instant hit. &lt;Ditto&gt; and &lt;OMG&gt; was proof against a sophomore slump and NewJeans drove home an even larger success through taking the top 3 spot on the charts as well as placing within the Billboard Hot100 within 6 months of debut. Looking back from right before &lt;Ditto&gt; was released to now, how does it feel?*

**MHJ:** There’s a lot going through my mind now. I’m not really the type to worry about superstitions. Right now, I’m getting ready for our next album. It’s going to be something completely new so I hope you all are ready. I remember the moments right before releasing &lt;Ditto&gt;. I thought my heart was going to explode. &lt;Ditto&gt; meant a lot to me, even on a personal level.

**Cine21:** *What do you mean?*

**MHJ:** As the title suggests, ‘Ditto’ was meant to build relatability and furthermore has the meaning of making up.

**Cine21:** *You strategized on announcing the pre-release &lt;Ditto&gt; and the single album 《OMG》 pretty closely with the 1st EP 《New Jeans》. One could say it was a pretty similar yet different strategy from releasing 4 songs and MV back to back without any introduction. Why did you decide to release one single at a time when you could have collected more songs for an EP or go straight to a full LP? I’m curious if this was related to the long term success of the first EP.*

**MHJ:** The idea behind this winter's record was pretty genuine. To give back. A response of sorts on the attention and love we received on the first project. So we led with a warm hearted song &lt;Ditto&gt;, opened a holiday pop-up, and decided to continuously donate a part of the record sale profits. We wanted to put together a package that felt like a Christmas gift and thank everyone for the amount of love they gave towards the 1st EP. It was cancelled due to Covid but originally the NewJeans members were planned to visit a children’s hospital on Christmas day as well.

**Cine21:** *Instead of Hybe’s producers, NewJeans music is being made by producers from BANA, a label that was founded by the former SM Ent employee Kim Kihyun. Why did you decide to work with BANA? I want to hear what the process of getting NewJeans’ music ready was like.*

**MHJ:** The premise that I might be expected to work with HYBE producers sounds a bit weird. I think there’s a couple misunderstandings because ADOR started as a label within HYBE. To put it bluntly, ADOR is a company founded to allow Min Heejin do music and business the way she desires to. This also means that the company will be run differently from the pre-existing media industry systems. The mission of a company holds a lot of meaning. If someone asks how I’ve been able to work 20 years in the idol industry even though I originally had no interest in it, you could say that it was the desire to provide an alternate vision and new music that doesn’t exist yet in the mainstream market. This is the reason I said that “\[their\] concept is their music itself” right before the launch of NewJeans.

I am not a songwriter or a lyricist, just a producer that has nothing to do with copyright. The flip side of this means that I can do my work without being restrained by a song’s composition. This also means that ideally, Ador’s music is borderless and free of constraints. So working with those who understand my music tastes was much more important than creating an organized system. BANA’s Kihyun is an old friend from my SM Ent days. We became friends because we both did not agree with the company’s style and system at the time. I guess we were the troublemakers. And that’s also why we both left to create our own companies. When I launched ADOR under HYBE, I strongly argued for a complete “lack of interference on creativity and our independent operations”. And as such, HYBE has no say or relation to how ADOR operates and runs production. So it feels weird when I sometimes see ADOR’s music style grouped with SM or HYBE.

BANA members and I have known each other for a long time. Kihyun in particular already knew why I was founding ADOR, my long term goals, and my music tastes so it was easy working with him. ADOR’s music does not rely on a single songwriter. As mentioned earlier ADOR was founded to realize my music and vision. So our organization and and the way we work is different from other companies. I collect music and decide \[their release\]. For instance, NewJeans’ 1st EP was built from a library of demos I’ve been collecting since before NewJeans was even put together. So a lot of the guesses on the songwriter’s intentions are all wrong. I share a lot of opinions with Kihyun in the process of collecting songs, finishing them, and working out their details. And then we work out the details like mixing, mastering, and vocal directing under my direction.

**Cine21:** *The fact that the music that a former creative director and now producer chose and released became one of the most widely successful music of the year means a lot. How do you interpret the music’s success?*

**MHJ:** There are a couple factors that I emphasize, such as melodic progression or vocal style. Personally, I have very much not been a fan of the way K-Pop typically handles melodic progression or vocal styles. The need to include a high pitched part, awkward and sudden rap sections, everyone sounding the same, etc. Of course, I do respect those who enjoy this style. But I do not like these elements and wanted a world in which music without those elements can exist. I started leading overall production in order to be in control of these details.

‘Songwriting’ as a concept is fairly open-ended these days. It’s rare for a beat maker to also take on top lining and most don’t even recognize the concept of a top liner so most people don’t understand the role they play in making music so it’s understandable that most people fail to understand. The importance of a beatmaker versus a topliner varies song to song so I can’t say which is more important. And as such it’s arguable that the role of a director that manages this overall process has grown. All this means that a song isn’t made by one person. If you hear demo samples with different toplines on top of the same beat, I’m sure this will make a lot more sense. The outcome might have been very different if the beatmaker or the melody maker directed the vocals instead of myself. 250, who gained a lot of recognition through working with us, has always been a polished producer and has given music to other idol teams as well. But the output has been very different from ours. It might be obvious but the style of a final product changes depending on the final stakeholder’s decisions. A lot rides on my decisions. So word choice of asking how I “chose” is right yet wrong. I’m someone that wants the change the game. I wanted to break the existing notion on how K-Pop can be successful. I became a producer and a CEO and yet I still desire to work in a creative environment that is free of prejudice. I hope lots of different thoughts appear in this market. This is coming from from a former art director that had no interest in idols. This should be your takeaway.

Typically, when something is successful, people like to look at the result and understand the process by going backwards. But there are serious limitations to this given that there is a finite amount of experiences to analyze and draw conclusions out of. The reality I experienced and have built is often very different from the 3rd person’s presumptive perspectives, because everyone works differently and approaches their lives differently. The title of Art Director, Creative Director, and Producers all meant different things per industry and per person. Never assume things with little basis. Things that feel new do for a reason. Using old conventions to understand newness could already be an outdated practice. One needs to think outside the box to think differently. Easily defining how success is made is not something every record producer is capable of. But if you must know how I think, I could say this. Perhaps it was the harmony of an attractive beat and melody paired with a easy to listen vocal with all the overwhelming aspects removed. There is a reason I wanted to be strong at the basics.

**Cine21:** *Lets talk about the MV story. There has bee a trend of adding lore or an overall narrative but this seems absent in NewJeans. Was this a deliberate move away from the way the K-Pop industry has been obsessed in lore? Or was this to give each album a different concept?*

**MHJ:** To summarize, I’m a person that is against K-Pop’s perspective on lore (laughter). NewJeans is a team that lacks the K-Pop element of lore. But one could argue that our message, which we have been sending pretty consistently, is a narrative of sorts. And if that’s how you understand us, that’s very welcome. I am a curious person by nature and I always look for fun. NewJeans albums will continue to state this similar message over different formats.

I’ve read someone argue that they enjoy NewJeans for their lack of being complicated by lore building that K-Pop has been pushing as of recent. Of course, NewJeans has their own stories and concepts but they seemed to like that NewJeans was not hastily building a narrative, followed by the creator’s attitude of forcing symbolism and for the audience to analyze it. NewJeans seems to be the result of Min Heejin asking questions such as “What is a concept to an idol” or “How do you build a story” and such. How did you reach a conclusion and apply them to your work?

It feels like the community has been rather sensitive on the ideal of a self driven, independent idol. But it’s ironic that they idealize this yet welcome lore that seem to treat them as characters. Aren’t these two opposing concepts? I have not been able to actually measure the effectiveness of what the K-pop community calls ‘lore’ (laughter) so even as someone who has worked in this industry for several years, I question whether we’re just overgeneralizing from the opinions of the select few. Several factors play a role in creating popularity so it’s difficult to measure the actual impact of what we call lore. Because of that, I had no reason the ‘push’ for lore. NewJeans will adapt and provide a topic that is appropriate for each moment in time, as seen in how we released &lt;Ditto&gt; as an answer to the debut album last summer.

**Cine21:** *I heard that ‘deer in a snowfield’ imagery in the &lt;Ditto&gt; MV was directly from you. What was reason? Personally it reminded me of &lt;Stand By Me&gt; and &lt;All That Heaven Allows&gt;.*

**MHJ:** When I first heard the intro to the &lt;Ditto&gt; demo, I was absolutely taken back by the chorus. It was as if it expressed everything I wanted to say. And a picture came into my head. A deer that randomly pops out in a white snow field and the faces of people who meet the unexpected. As if to represent the relationship between consumers and NewJeans who debuted out of nowhere. I was thinking of those who witnessed the beauty of freedom in an open, empty environment and their desire to own it. The desire to chase after something beautiful, while unintentional, puts constraints on the subject and ironically reduces their charm. I thought of this bizarre relationship and thought it’s similar to our reality. I understand people may not trust and question something they have yet to experience but I wanted to state that we will shine more brightly when we are left free. I even thought that that might be something that everyone actually wants. I collected &lt;Attention&gt; &lt;Hype boy&gt; &lt;Hurt&gt; &lt;OMG&gt; in 2019 but &lt;Ditto&gt; in particular was produced \[from my ask\] for the winter of 2022. Ironically, The misunderstandings from the 1st EP was what made &lt;Ditto&gt; happen. I wanted to wrap up the misunderstanding by reconciling \[TL note: she’s being very deliberate w her word choice. She’s not calling it a fight, she’s not saying she’s apologizing. She wants to make up for what’s happened and what’s happened is a misunderstanding\]. As if we could transfer the heat of the summer to the warmth of the winter. So I was even more sure that I wanted to build an album that felt like a gift.

**Cine21:** *I heard that you gave director Shin Wooseok complete creative control. Is this how you approach all your work? If there are parts that you are more involved in versus not, I’m curious how you decide which is which.*

**MHJ:** The way I work is always different for each project. When I was on &lt;You Quiz on the Block&gt; two years ago, I saw the episode with Dolphiner Films Director Shin Wooseok. I felt like the way he approaches work and sees the market is similar to me. As in, he was not fantasizing about the media industry, he had strong beliefs, he worked without borders, etc. Of course, I wasn’t planning on working with him back then. While working on 《OMG》, I wanted to give a completely different impression than that of the 1st EP. In order to do that, I needed a completely different direction in the MV as well. And Director Shin came into my head. I wanted someone who had never filmed any K-Pop MVs and I needed a creative mindset that thinks without borders. After meeting with him, I was excited about his lack of interest in the K-Pop community and his unique work ethic. I still remember his first question when we held our first meeting after we decided to start working. He wanted to know the long term plan and the future direction of NewJeans. He said he needed to know the overall direction in order to figure out what story to tell. And I was so relieved. I can’t not be excited when I thinks something is important and someone asks that very thing. His work style and his thought process was very similar to mine as well. He’s someone that can do the A to Z by himself. And I know, better than anyone, that they do not need anyone else to interfere with their work. Most importantly, I wanted to something that I couldn’t imagine so I wanted to stay out of it. So I volunteered as assistant. I asked him to do everything he needs to and that I will support from every direction, whether it be costuming or other filming needs. I then briefed him on our mission, the context of this industry, the future direction of NewJeans, and the role of this particular album. And we discussed all of these for a while. We weren’t neccessarily just discussing the concept or the narrative. And this goes for the deer as well. I let him know that “All I wanted was for him to understand the ‘why’ behind the impression I got. No need to be boggled down in the look and feel of it. I don’t want to buldoze over your thought process.” It’s not a specific order, but rather a producer’s “why” could be a part of the concept or the inspiration. I think Director Shin did a great job with both &lt;Ditto&gt; and &lt;OMG&gt;. I wanted &lt;OMG&gt; to be considerably unique since &lt;Ditto&gt; is something that everyone would enjoy. And he delivered. I recall being surpirsed after reading the first scenario of &lt;OMG&gt;. The paradox of the K-Pop industry, the direction of NewJeans, both were well implemented.

The dance MV have a strong appeal of their own. I know that there is value to visual side of it so we made several dance MVs. The actual MV needs to hold a larger message and deliver something more. I wanted to say that there things that are more important than the view counts. I work with young children so this is something I honestly needed to do.

**Cine21:** *I’m curious about the leadership of Minheejin, as someone who decides on a direction, listens to her coworkers and draws a larger picture.*

**MHJ:** I talk with everyone involved about the ultimate end goal. I get rather specific about the plan and how we get there. Because I have a very clear plan on how I want to do my work. Same goes for the NewJeans members. I take a lot of effort in explaining what I want to do, what I want to say, and why this is important to us. In a way, this is more important than explaining a concept or a storyline. It’s building the right foundations. One of the essential roles I play is driving this directive such that those intentions show themselves as needed.

For instance, I argued for a specific style of choreo, an unconventional and freestyle style that’s different from the common idol knife choreography, way before NewJeans came together. ADOR’s performance director Kim Jooeun agreed with and understand my intentions well, and it’s all in the result. &lt;Hype Boy&gt; was an example where we received an initial draft and did a complete refresh. I re-explained the style we need and asked her to redo the choreo. I’m not a choreopgraher so I can’t ask for a specific move or detailed movements. I just do what I can to explain the mood and direction I’m looking for. And the result was great. It was a viral hit as a challenge, and we continued to collaborate. We went with the original draft for &lt;Cookie&gt; and &lt;OMG&gt; without editing them. Talented people just need a solid direction and support. Same goes for ADOR’s stylist Choi Yoomi. It’s easy working with her since we share similar perspectives. Maybe it’s because I built this label to work a little more comfortably. I work well when my mind is at peace. And that happens when I work with those that share similar values. Only then can I lead and tell them to follow me. Micromanagement has it’s time and place. It’s not an always or a never. Micromangement is often seen in choreography since many people are working together closely. To draw the best result, small details need to be explained and directions need to set. This isn’t easy since the other person has feelings. Everyone is different and best I can do is adapt to each situation and subject. Good results aren’t easy. Director Shin Donggul, who directed &lt;Hype Boy&gt; and &lt;Cookie&gt; used the expression “mothership”. It sounded like consolation.

**Cine21:** *From SM Ent’s Visual and Art Director to Creative Director, to HYBE’s CBO, and now to ADOR’s leader. I imaging there was a process in learning how these roles differ. I wonder why you decided to become a leader and a executive producer after coming to ADOR. Business and production could’ve been separately managed and yet you chose to do both; why?*

**MHJ:** I founded a label to be an executive producer and took the role of a CEO to be fully independent as an executive producer. Creativity is a field that requires close communication with business management. This doesn’t imply reckless spending behavior. Success in creativity within pop culture is measured by the numbers. This isn’t pure art. So to me, creativity and business have been on the same line of importance. It’s been 20 years since I’ve been a part of this industry. I’ve witnessed a lot of mistakes and mishap over those 20 years. If someone asks what I’ve learned over these 20 years, it’s, “Ah, that’s what I should avoid.” and “I should avoid that.” I’ve witnessed plenty of conflict that arose from misunderstanding between creativity and business. Simply spending a lot of money without proper planning does not lead to good creative output nor business output. Many people use the phrase “HYBE funds” to explain everything, but it’s not an expression I agree with. Invested funds and actual label management strategy that utilize them is separate from HYBE and is fully under the label’s control, and furthermore I’ve received a couple other investment opportunities of simiar value at the time from companies other than HYBE. I had several options at the time and regardless of the investor, my number 1 request was always ‘creative independence’ and ‘nonintervention’, so it didn’t have to be HYBE. Then this leads to ‘why I had to choose HYBE,’ but I will stop here since that will lead to a completely different topic than this interview.

The 1st EP budget was not hastily planned at all. Lots of folks mentioned HYBE’s capital regarding the 4 MVs and their production budget. HYBE has no say over ADOR’s production plan or how the funds are spent, because we were promised autonomy in business management. Our budget is not too different from other companies or labels, because the production budget was planned from my experience with budgeting and market research. If anything, we were much more efficient given the amount produced. And sure, budget helps, but a lot of it doesn’t always lead to good results. I try my best to balance spending and creativity based on my experience in the field. And that’s one of the factors that allowed for a NewJeans to be paid so quickly. Account balancing is different for each company and is a top secret so not a lot of people actually know how they work. Maybe it’s because of this lack of understanding, but I saw a lot of people talk about how NewJeans were paid 2 months into debut. Some were confused between creative neighboring rights \[TL:no idea what this is\] and account balancing. Some were arguing that it was possible because we’re a part of a large company.

Given how rare this is in the industry, I don’t not understand. At least based on what I’ve seen, nobody has been paid this quickly. But nobody has 3 debut title tracks. And nobody had all three enter the charts so quickly and stay on top for the long run. The market is changing so obviously there aren’t examples to compare us to and so I understand people are guessing. We didn’t pay NewJeans because we were nice, and it wasn’t because HYBE is big. It happened because the necessary conditions were met. To summarize, it happened due to a balanced budget plan, a triple title strategy, and the outcome of being successful pretty quickly. When I first decided on three title tracks, lots of people were surprised and said a lot of things, but I was able to make the decision because I was a producer and yet a CEO. Filming several MVs was also possible because I was a producer and a CEO. If you’re a producer, you need to understand that pop culture is not free from the numbers. I able to think about how to create those numbers and alternate solutions preceisely because I’m a creative and an administrator, not an administrator that has nothing to do with the creative side.

**Cine21:** *I heard that you had no interest in K-Pop or the idol industry when you were in school. What did you have trouble accepting while working within the K-pop industry? What were some industry wide practices that you wanted to ignore?*

**MHJ:** When I was in school, I had no interest in idol culture. If anything, I was a bit more on the critical side. I think that’s what allowed me to join this industry. To be honest I constantly ran into situations that were hard to accept while working. I don’t think it was just being angry, but more that it logically didn’t make sense. I can’t pick just one or two things. Perhaps I built this label to prove that those outdated practices or prejudices can be broken.

Because we’re talking about ‘something that I couldn’t understand about this industry’, something recent comes to mind, even though it’s a bit off topic. People who talk about me as a successful fan or the theory that I am projecting my own past into the MV. Taking imaginative guess that’s far from the truth and assuming that they’re correct is already dangerous in itself. I felt pity when I saw people attacking based on those assumptions and couldn’t begin to understand where it started go wrong. Isn’t attacking somebody based on unconfirmed guesses actually just making up whatever reason to hate? It felt like I was witnessing this persistent dark side of the industry. It’s not limited to this recent incident, but it’s always a bit scary when I realize some people are too deep in idol culture beyond understanding.

**Cine21:** *Maybe it’s because you’re a producer that’s been getting a lot of attention, but you’ve been receiving off criticisms from people who don’t understand the industry, and from a third person perspective, it feels like I saw you being over criticized pretty often. How do you feel about this. How are you managing all this on a personal level and as a CEO.*

**MHJ:** The idol industry as I understand is full of various contradictions and unique characteristics. It’s a complicated topic, but the idol industry is typically composed of trainees in their teens that peak in their early 20s. The industry is characterized by companies that find these underage trainees and train them. Because of this, prospective idols look for stability in management and fandoms desire that the most for the person they support. But it’s also true that due to this, fandoms maintain a hostile attitude towards these companies by default. Of course, there’s been many incidents and unsolved issues so I understand that there are criticisms. I imagine over criticizing and being excessively absorbed in the culture is the result of these unsolved issues that have just become characteristics.

My relationship with NewJeans, at the very least, is different from the stereotypical entertainment label to artist relationship. A new kind of relationship within the media industry. And I didn’t pop out of nowhere, I’ve been in this K-Pop industry the last twenty years as content producer. I realize, however, that I can’t change everything overnight. It’s up to me to prove through my attitude and outcomes. It’s been 6 months since I launched NewJeans. My name’s on everything we do so I couldn’t slack off in any aspect. Content, TV appearances, ads, and marketing: I am consistently trying to do what I can do provide new direction and fix some of their respective issues. It’s a small thing, but NewJeans albums did not contain random assortments of photocards that are quite popular among idol fans. This is because I wanted people to buy our products for what they are, not because of marketing gimmicks. I was glad to see the excited response but I was also curious. One of the experiments I wanted to do while launching ADOR and NewJeans is how far I can get with just the basics. This is why we didn’t do a YouTube promo campaign. I wanted to compete with the foundations; music, choreo, and content. It’s easier to evaluate reality the cleaner your data is. And once you set that as your basis, it’s easier to decide where to go next.

If anything, they’re sweet consumers that are excited by photo cards. They move me. If this their attitude now, I’m wondering how excited they can be once I’m going all in. Just a random thought but I’m suddenly just very thankful. It’s fun creating content by bouncing back and forth between the fans. If you look at just my title, you could ask why a CEO is knee deep in all this work but my title doesn’t change what I do. If I need it, I make it and new things that are perhaps hard to explain. I wanted to create a new kind of relationship with our consumers. The reason I founded ADOR was to do something I enjoy. ‘Fun’ influences a lot. ‘Fun’ is the foundation of the ‘entertainment’ industry. And that’s what I’m focusing on. And because we’re in our early days, I am indeed involved in leading a lot. But good results will serve a good reference point for people at ADOR.

**MHJ:** There’s a lot going through my mind now. I’m not really the type to worry about superstitions. Right now, I’m getting ready for our next album.

**MHJ:** The premise that I might be expected to work with HYBE producers sounds a bit weird. I think there’s a couple misunderstandings because ADOR started as a label within HYBE. To put it bluntly, ADOR is a company founded to allow Min Heejin do music and business the way she desires to. This also means that the company will be run differently from the pre-existing media industry systems. The mission of a company holds a lot of meaning. If someone asks how I’ve been able to work 20 years in the idol industry even though I originally had no interest in it, you could say that it was the desire to provide an alternate vision and new music that doesn’t exist yet in the mainstream market.

BANA’s Kihyun is an old friend from my SM Ent days. We became friends because we both did not agree with the company’s style and system at the time. I guess we were the troublemakers. And that’s also why we both left to create our own companies. When I launched ADOR under HYBE, I strongly argued for a complete “lack of interference on creativity and our independent operations”. And as such, HYBE has no say or relation to how ADOR operates and runs production. So it feels weird when I sometimes see ADOR’s music style grouped with SM or HYBE.

BANA members and I have known each other for a long time. Kihyun in particular already knew why I was founding ADOR, my long term goals, and my music tastes so it was easy working with him. ADOR’s music does not rely on a single songwriter. As mentioned earlier ADOR was founded to realize my music and vision. So our organization and and the way we work is different from other companies. I collect music and decide \[their release\]. For instance, NewJeans’ 1st EP was built from a library of demos I’ve been collecting since before NewJeans was even put together. So a lot of the guesses on the songwriter’s intentions are all wrong. I share a lot of opinions with Kihyun in the process of collecting songs, finishing them, and working out their details. And then we work out the details like mixing, mastering, and vocal directing under my direction.

**Cine21:** *The fact that the music that a former creative director and now producer chose and released became one of the most widely successful music of the year means a lot. How do you interpret the music’s success?*

**MHJ:** There are a couple factors that I emphasize, such as melodic progression or vocal style. Personally, I have very much not been a fan of the way K-Pop typically handles melodic progression or vocal styles. The need to include a high pitched part, awkward and sudden rap sections, everyone sounding the same, etc. Of course, I do respect those who enjoy this style. But I do not like these elements and wanted a world in which music without those elements can exist. I started leading overall production in order to be in control of these details.

‘Songwriting’ as a concept is fairly open-ended these days. It’s rare for a beat maker to also take on top lining and most don’t even recognize the concept of a top liner so most people don’t understand the role they play in making music so it’s understandable that most people fail to understand. The importance of a beatmaker versus a topliner varies song to song so I can’t say which is more important. And as such it’s arguable that the role of a director that manages this overall process has grown. All this means that a song isn’t made by one person. If you hear demo samples with different toplines on top of the same beat, I’m sure this will make a lot more sense. The outcome might have been very different if the beatmaker or the melody maker directed the vocals instead of myself. 250, who gained a lot of recognition through working with us, has always been a polished producer and has given music to other idol teams as well. But the output has been very different from ours. It might be obvious but the style of a final product changes depending on the final stakeholder’s decisions. A lot rides on my decisions. So word choice of asking how I “chose” is right yet wrong. I’m someone that wants the change the game. I wanted to break the existing notion on how K-Pop can be successful. I became a producer and a CEO and yet I still desire to work in a creative environment that is free of prejudice. I hope lots of different thoughts appear in this market. This is coming from from a former art director that had no interest in idols. This should be your takeaway.

Typically, when something is successful, people like to look at the result and understand the process by going backwards. But there are serious limitations to this given that there is a finite amount of experiences to analyze and draw conclusions out of. The reality I experienced and have built is often very different from the 3rd person’s presumptive perspectives, because everyone works differently and approaches their lives differently. The title of Art Director, Creative Director, and Producers all meant different things per industry and per person. Never assume things with little basis. Things that feel new do for a reason. Using old conventions to understand newness could already be an outdated practice. One needs to think outside the box to think differently. Easily defining how success is made is not something every record producer is capable of. But if you must know how I think, I could say this. Perhaps it was the harmony of an attractive beat and melody paired with a easy to listen vocal with all the overwhelming aspects removed. There is a reason I wanted to be strong at the basics.

**Cine21:** *Lets talk about the MV story. There has bee a trend of adding lore or an overall narrative but this seems absent in NewJeans. Was this a deliberate move away from the way the K-Pop industry has been obsessed in lore? Or was this to give each album a different concept?*

**MHJ:** To summarize, I’m a person that is against K-Pop’s perspective on lore (laughter). NewJeans is a team that lacks the K-Pop element of lore. But one could argue that our message, which we have been sending pretty consistently, is a narrative of sorts. And if that’s how you understand us, that’s very welcome. I am a curious person by nature and I always look for fun. NewJeans albums will continue to state this similar message over different formats.

I’ve read someone argue that they enjoy NewJeans for their lack of being complicated by lore building that K-Pop has been pushing as of recent. Of course, NewJeans has their own stories and concepts but they seemed to like that NewJeans was not hastily building a narrative, followed by the creator’s attitude of forcing symbolism and for the audience to analyze it. NewJeans seems to be the result of Min Heejin asking questions such as “What is a concept to an idol” or “How do you build a story” and such. How did you reach a conclusion and apply them to your work?

It feels like the community has been rather sensitive on the ideal of a self driven, independent idol. But it’s ironic that they idealize this yet welcome lore that seem to treat them as characters. Aren’t these two opposing concepts? I have not been able to actually measure the effectiveness of what the K-pop community calls ‘lore’ (laughter) so even as someone who has worked in this industry for several years, I question whether we’re just overgeneralizing from the opinions of the select few. Several factors play a role in creating popularity so it’s difficult to measure the actual impact of what we call lore. Because of that, I had no reason the ‘push’ for lore. NewJeans will adapt and provide a topic that is appropriate for each moment in time, as seen in how we released &lt;Ditto&gt; as an answer to the debut album last summer.

**Cine21:** *I heard that ‘deer in a snowfield’ imagery in the &lt;Ditto&gt; MV was directly from you. What was reason? Personally it reminded me of &lt;Stand By Me&gt; and &lt;All That Heaven Allows&gt;.*

**MHJ:** When I first heard the intro to the &lt;Ditto&gt; demo, I was absolutely taken back by the chorus. It was as if it expressed everything I wanted to say. And a picture came into my head. A deer that randomly pops out in a white snow field and the faces of people who meet the unexpected. As if to represent the relationship between consumers and NewJeans who debuted out of nowhere. I was thinking of those who witnessed the beauty of freedom in an open, empty environment and their desire to own it. The desire to chase after something beautiful, while unintentional, puts constraints on the subject and ironically reduces their charm. I thought of this bizarre relationship and thought it’s similar to our reality. I understand people may not trust and question something they have yet to experience but I wanted to state that we will shine more brightly when we are left free. I even thought that that might be something that everyone actually wants. I collected &lt;Attention&gt; &lt;Hype boy&gt; &lt;Hurt&gt; &lt;OMG&gt; in 2019 but &lt;Ditto&gt; in particular was produced \[from my ask\] for the winter of 2022. Ironically, The misunderstandings from the 1st EP was what made &lt;Ditto&gt; happen. I wanted to wrap up the misunderstanding by reconciling \[TL note: she’s being very deliberate w her word choice. She’s not calling it a fight, she’s not saying she’s apologizing. She wants to make up for what’s happened and what’s happened is a misunderstanding\]. As if we could transfer the heat of the summer to the warmth of the winter. So I was even more sure that I wanted to build an album that felt like a gift.

**Cine21:** *I heard that you gave director Shin Wooseok complete creative control. Is this how you approach all your work? If there are parts that you are more involved in versus not, I’m curious how you decide which is which.*

**MHJ:** The way I work is always different for each project. When I was on &lt;You Quiz on the Block&gt; two years ago, I saw the episode with Dolphiner Films Director Shin Wooseok. I felt like the way he approaches work and sees the market is similar to me. As in, he was not fantasizing about the media industry, he had strong beliefs, he worked without borders, etc. Of course, I wasn’t planning on working with him back then. While working on 《OMG》, I wanted to give a completely different impression than that of the 1st EP. In order to do that, I needed a completely different direction in the MV as well. And Director Shin came into my head. I wanted someone who had never filmed any K-Pop MVs and I needed a creative mindset that thinks without borders. After meeting with him, I was excited about his lack of interest in the K-Pop community and his unique work ethic. I still remember his first question when we held our first meeting after we decided to start working. He wanted to know the long term plan and the future direction of NewJeans. He said he needed to know the overall direction in order to figure out what story to tell. And I was so relieved. I can’t not be excited when I thinks something is important and someone asks that very thing. His work style and his thought process was very similar to mine as well. He’s someone that can do the A to Z by himself. And I know, better than anyone, that they do not need anyone else to interfere with their work. Most importantly, I wanted to something that I couldn’t imagine so I wanted to stay out of it. So I volunteered as assistant. I asked him to do everything he needs to and that I will support from every direction, whether it be costuming or other filming needs. I then briefed him on our mission, the context of this industry, the future direction of NewJeans, and the role of this particular album. And we discussed all of these for a while. We weren’t neccessarily just discussing the concept or the narrative. And this goes for the deer as well. I let him know that “All I wanted was for him to understand the ‘why’ behind the impression I got. No need to be boggled down in the look and feel of it. I don’t want to buldoze over your thought process.” It’s not a specific order, but rather a producer’s “why” could be a part of the concept or the inspiration. I think Director Shin did a great job with both &lt;Ditto&gt; and &lt;OMG&gt;. I wanted &lt;OMG&gt; to be considerably unique since &lt;Ditto&gt; is something that everyone would enjoy. And he delivered. I recall being surpirsed after reading the first scenario of &lt;OMG&gt;. The paradox of the K-Pop industry, the direction of NewJeans, both were well implemented.

The dance MV have a strong appeal of their own. I know that there is value to visual side of it so we made several dance MVs. The actual MV needs to hold a larger message and deliver something more. I wanted to say that there things that are more important than the view counts. I work with young children so this is something I honestly needed to do.

**Cine21:** *I’m curious about the leadership of Minheejin, as someone who decides on a direction, listens to her coworkers and draws a larger picture.*

**MHJ:** I talk with everyone involved about the ultimate end goal. I get rather specific about the plan and how we get there. Because I have a very clear plan on how I want to do my work. Same goes for the NewJeans members. I take a lot of effort in explaining what I want to do, what I want to say, and why this is important to us. In a way, this is more important than explaining a concept or a storyline. It’s building the right foundations. One of the essential roles I play is driving this directive such that those intentions show themselves as needed.

For instance, I argued for a specific style of choreo, an unconventional and freestyle style that’s different from the common idol knife choreography, way before NewJeans came together. ADOR’s performance director Kim Jooeun agreed with and understand my intentions well, and it’s all in the result. &lt;Hype Boy&gt; was an example where we received an initial draft and did a complete refresh. I re-explained the style we need and asked her to redo the choreo. I’m not a choreopgraher so I can’t ask for a specific move or detailed movements. I just do what I can to explain the mood and direction I’m looking for. And the result was great. It was a viral hit as a challenge, and we continued to collaborate. We went with the original draft for &lt;Cookie&gt; and &lt;OMG&gt; without editing them. Talented people just need a solid direction and support. Same goes for ADOR’s stylist Choi Yoomi. It’s easy working with her since we share similar perspectives. Maybe it’s because I built this label to work a little more comfortably. I work well when my mind is at peace. And that happens when I work with those that share similar values. Only then can I lead and tell them to follow me. Micromanagement has it’s time and place. It’s not an always or a never. Micromangement is often seen in choreography since many people are working together closely. To draw the best result, small details need to be explained and directions need to set. This isn’t easy since the other person has feelings. Everyone is different and best I can do is adapt to each situation and subject. Good results aren’t easy. Director Shin Donggul, who directed &lt;Hype Boy&gt; and &lt;Cookie&gt; used the expression “mothership”. It sounded like consolation.

**Cine21:** *From SM Ent’s Visual and Art Director to Creative Director, to HYBE’s CBO, and now to ADOR’s leader. I imaging there was a process in learning how these roles differ. I wonder why you decided to become a leader and a executive producer after coming to ADOR. Business and production could’ve been separately managed and yet you chose to do both; why?*

**MHJ:** I founded a label to be an executive producer and took the role of a CEO to be fully independent as an executive producer. Creativity is a field that requires close communication with business management. This doesn’t imply reckless spending behavior. Success in creativity within pop culture is measured by the numbers. This isn’t pure art. So to me, creativity and business have been on the same line of importance. It’s been 20 years since I’ve been a part of this industry. I’ve witnessed a lot of mistakes and mishap over those 20 years. If someone asks what I’ve learned over these 20 years, it’s, “Ah, that’s what I should avoid.” and “I should avoid that.” I’ve witnessed plenty of conflict that arose from misunderstanding between creativity and business. Simply spending a lot of money without proper planning does not lead to good creative output nor business output. Many people use the phrase “HYBE funds” to explain everything, but it’s not an expression I agree with. Invested funds and actual label management strategy that utilize them is separate from HYBE and is fully under the label’s control, and furthermore I’ve received a couple other investment opportunities of simiar value at the time from companies other than HYBE. I had several options at the time and regardless of the investor, my number 1 request was always ‘creative independence’ and ‘nonintervention’, so it didn’t have to be HYBE. Then this leads to ‘why I had to choose HYBE,’ but I will stop here since that will lead to a completely different topic than this interview.

The 1st EP budget was not hastily planned at all. Lots of folks mentioned HYBE’s capital regarding the 4 MVs and their production budget. HYBE has no say over ADOR’s production plan or how the funds are spent, because we were promised autonomy in business management. Our budget is not too different from other companies or labels, because the production budget was planned from my experience with budgeting and market research. If anything, we were much more efficient given the amount produced. And sure, budget helps, but a lot of it doesn’t always lead to good results. I try my best to balance spending and creativity based on my experience in the field. And that’s one of the factors that allowed for a NewJeans to be paid so quickly. Account balancing is different for each company and is a top secret so not a lot of people actually know how they work. Maybe it’s because of this lack of understanding, but I saw a lot of people talk about how NewJeans were paid 2 months into debut. Some were confused between creative neighboring rights \[TL:no idea what this is\] and account balancing. Some were arguing that it was possible because we’re a part of a large company.

Given how rare this is in the industry, I don’t not understand. At least based on what I’ve seen, nobody has been paid this quickly. But nobody has 3 debut title tracks. And nobody had all three enter the charts so quickly and stay on top for the long run. The market is changing so obviously there aren’t examples to compare us to and so I understand people are guessing. We didn’t pay NewJeans because we were nice, and it wasn’t because HYBE is big. It happened because the necessary conditions were met. To summarize, it happened due to a balanced budget plan, a triple title strategy, and the outcome of being successful pretty quickly. When I first decided on three title tracks, lots of people were surprised and said a lot of things, but I was able to make the decision because I was a producer and yet a CEO. Filming several MVs was also possible because I was a producer and a CEO. If you’re a producer, you need to understand that pop culture is not free from the numbers. I able to think about how to create those numbers and alternate solutions preceisely because I’m a creative and an administrator, not an administrator that has nothing to do with the creative side.

**Cine21:** *I heard that you had no interest in K-Pop or the idol industry when you were in school. What did you have trouble accepting while working within the K-pop industry? What were some industry wide practices that you wanted to ignore?*

**MHJ:** When I was in school, I had no interest in idol culture. If anything, I was a bit more on the critical side. I think that’s what allowed me to join this industry. To be honest I constantly ran into situations that were hard to accept while working. I don’t think it was just being angry, but more that it logically didn’t make sense. I can’t pick just one or two things. Perhaps I built this label to prove that those outdated practices or prejudices can be broken.

Because we’re talking about ‘something that I couldn’t understand about this industry’, something recent comes to mind, even though it’s a bit off topic. People who talk about me as a successful fan or the theory that I am projecting my own past into the MV. Taking imaginative guess that’s far from the truth and assuming that they’re correct is already dangerous in itself. I felt pity when I saw people attacking based on those assumptions and couldn’t begin to understand where it started go wrong. Isn’t attacking somebody based on unconfirmed guesses actually just making up whatever reason to hate? It felt like I was witnessing this persistent dark side of the industry. It’s not limited to this recent incident, but it’s always a bit scary when I realize some people are too deep in idol culture beyond understanding.

**Cine21:** *Maybe it’s because you’re a producer that’s been getting a lot of attention, but you’ve been receiving off criticisms from people who don’t understand the industry, and from a third person perspective, it feels like I saw you being over criticized pretty often. How do you feel about this. How are you managing all this on a personal level and as a CEO.*

**MHJ:** The idol industry as I understand is full of various contradictions and unique characteristics. It’s a complicated topic, but the idol industry is typically composed of trainees in their teens that peak in their early 20s. The industry is characterized by companies that find these underage trainees and train them. Because of this, prospective idols look for stability in management and fandoms desire that the most for the person they support. But it’s also true that due to this, fandoms maintain a hostile attitude towards these companies by default. Of course, there’s been many incidents and unsolved issues so I understand that there are criticisms. I imagine over criticizing and being excessively absorbed in the culture is the result of these unsolved issues that have just become characteristics.

My relationship with NewJeans, at the very least, is different from the stereotypical entertainment label to artist relationship. A new kind of relationship within the media industry. And I didn’t pop out of nowhere, I’ve been in this K-Pop industry the last twenty years as content producer. I realize, however, that I can’t change everything overnight. It’s up to me to prove through my attitude and outcomes. It’s been 6 months since I launched NewJeans. My name’s on everything we do so I couldn’t slack off in any aspect. Content, TV appearances, ads, and marketing: I am consistently trying to do what I can do provide new direction and fix some of their respective issues. It’s a small thing, but NewJeans albums did not contain random assortments of photocards that are quite popular among idol fans. This is because I wanted people to buy our products for what they are, not because of marketing gimmicks. I was glad to see the excited response but I was also curious. One of the experiments I wanted to do while launching ADOR and NewJeans is how far I can get with just the basics. This is why we didn’t do a YouTube promo campaign. I wanted to compete with the foundations; music, choreo, and content. It’s easier to evaluate reality the cleaner your data is. And once you set that as your basis, it’s easier to decide where to go next.

If anything, they’re sweet consumers that are excited by photo cards. They move me. If this their attitude now, I’m wondering how excited they can be once I’m going all in. Just a random thought but I’m suddenly just very thankful. It’s fun creating content by bouncing back and forth between the fans. If you look at just my title, you could ask why a CEO is knee deep in all this work but my title doesn’t change what I do. If I need it, I make it and new things that are perhaps hard to explain. I wanted to create a new kind of relationship with our consumers. The reason I founded ADOR was to do something I enjoy. ‘Fun’ influences a lot. ‘Fun’ is the foundation of the ‘entertainment’ industry. And that’s what I’m focusing on. And because we’re in our early days, I am indeed involved in leading a lot. But good results will serve a good reference point for people at ADOR.

\[There were three more paragraphs about MHJ arguing back at ppl who think she’s projecting too much of her in NewJeans. This is mostly the Korean twitter community so I'm going to skip it for now She’s collaborating with and helping NewJeans members become great artists, film directors dont get criticized for telling their stories when actors are a thing so really she doesn’t get what the fuss is. Also she likes music and film but has no clear preferences in style or genre. 250 gave her a rare LP from france as a gift.\]",min hee interiew full translation cine debut global attention st ep

and this made me realize that olivia, especially in her sour era, perfectly portrays those special events that most people of that age have in common, even across generations and continents (european millennial writing this). i still vividly remember my high school days and how, to me, three of the most important dates back then were the day i came of age, the day i had my final exam (later i even had the pleasure of playing with my band at my prom), and the day i got my driver's license.

oh and yes, *drivers license* is just such an iconic sign of growing up. it's crazy how olivia turned that into a song, but only used it symbolically and instead dealt with the completely different, seemingly unrelated, but much deeper motif of heartbreak.

16470,"When I first listened to GUTS at 2 A.M the day it came out, the stand-outs for me were making the bed, ballad of a homeschooled girl, and teenage dream as they related to me the most. While other tracks hadn't stood out to me as much, I still understood why they had their place on the album...except for the grudge.

I agreed with many critics and content creators who had thought the concept was weak and the hook was not strong enough as a chorus. But then, I had a really bad day. 

Long story short, an instance of herd mentality had made me feel isolated from everyone else and it made me incredibly upset. I was holding in tears at school until I got back home.

The first song I had thought of was the grudge so I immediately went and put it on and just bawled while taking in the lyrics. It had perfectly incapsulated how I felt in that moment: Angry, alone, deprived, misunderstood, ostracized etc...

Now it's my favorite song of Olivia's...maybe of all time.

NewJeans' heavily UK garage/DnB influenced bubblegum pop is PinkPantheress' exact soundscape. The airy vocals, the forlorn lyrics and the whimsical production is pretty much exactly PinkPantheress' style and I think she would be a great addition.

PP would bring an element of star power and crossover potential that is hard to grip in this sound's space. We've seen that PP can be a hitmaker on her own with [Boys a Liar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_hj-wT3biU), [Passion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Szr5Dcwn4Y) etc. and an excellent collaborator with [Boy's a Liar pt.2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oftolPu9qp4). Not to mention that it would be an internet darling for both artists as it seems that NewJeans' definitely feels like more of an internet-y type of group via their aesthetic and the penchant for trending dances and PP was born from TikTok. Both acts also like to have some of their songs run short. 

Both are clearly on an album/ep cycle too as they've been dropping singles all year to great success. And, the monthly listeners are comparable: 26 mill per month for PinkPantheress and 18 mill per month for NewJeans (but they have the machine behind them). Also PinkPantheress has already tapped into the [Powerpuff Girls theme](https://www.youtube.com/@ponies721), years before NewJeans. 

In North America/UK remixes typically are pretty organic, PinkPantheress did Boys a Liar pt.2 after DMing back and forth with Ice Spice to be on the track. Hip hop collabs are usually because of an interpersonal relationships too, Dave and Central Cee made [Sprinter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSY3i5XHHXo&pp=ygUUc3ByaW50ZXIgY2VudHJhbCBjZWU%3D) and [a whole EP together](https://open.spotify.com/album/0On7uutIu9rZRvP9aJbMog?si=55657f8356754d36) because they're friends who turned 25 this year.

1. the 1 - opening the story with “it could’ve been fun, if you would’ve been the one”, the main character wonders what their story would’ve been had they been together all this time, whether its a good or bad relationship

2. willow - the beginning of the relationship is when the MC goes for the person she wants. “life was a willow and it bent right to your wind” they find their way with each other and start dating for years and years

3. the last great american dynasty - they bought a house together and became the IT couple of the coastal town they found.

4. gold rush - the MC starts to fade away from ths daydream “the coastal town we never found will never see a love as pure as it. Cuz it fades into the gray of my day old tea”, slowly slipping away from the fantasy they had but trying theit best to reach out for what they want to truly believe in

5. my tears ricochet - “And I can go anywhere I want, anywhere I want just not home”, they want to go back to their fantasy which is what they consider home, but just cant hold onto to the fantasy any longer even though she keeps trying

6. tolerate it - “now im begging for footnotes in the story of your life”, the MC is trying to write footnotes, references, or mentions that could remind them of their fantasy relationship

7. august - “august slipped away into a moment in time”, they finally realize its just been a fantasy this whole time and woke up from it because it has fully slipped away

8. champagne problems - in real life, they had to go thru an arranged marriage but decided to run from the alter and not continue on with their wedding

9. right where you left me (bonus) - the significant other of the main character felt abandoned and froze in time, never moving on from the alter “im right where you left me”

10. tis the damn season - goes back to their parent’s house after all this fiasco and reminisces of their life and what could’ve been “time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires now im missing your smile”, forever having a lingering feeling of this fantasy relationship they wish could’ve been real

11. illicit affairs - “you taught me a secret language i cant speak with anyone else”

12. long story short - finally moving on with their life, they continue on just being another person in the society “long story short i survived”

*Disclaimer: I use the words ‘gay’ and ‘queer’ throughout this post as umbrella terms.*

One question people ask a lot is “If Taylor Swift is gay, why hasn’t she come out yet?” Here’s my theory from a PR perspective. 

Taylor Swift came out on the music scene is 2006 as a country music artist at just 16 years of age. Not only was she possibly too young to have figured out her sexuality yet, but the lack of acceptance of gay people among the generally conservative country music fans of the time likely caused her record label to tell her she couldn’t be openly gay/had to sing about boys more. The song Teardrops On My Guitar from that first album has an original, unreleased demo version that does not include he/him pronouns or the name “Drew” but those things *are* included in the album version of the song. Another song on the album, “Stay Beautiful”, includes the name ‘Corey’ but it’s rumored that the original version of the song had the name ‘Kelsey’ instead- in reference to her high school friend, Kelsey Morris, who she made a bunch of very flirtatious MySpace posts and comments about and is also the potential muse for the many references to a hometown love that she left behind for bigger and better things that are made throughout her discography ('Tis the Damn Season, Midnight Rain, Dorothea, etc.). These changes were almost certainly made at the request of her record label.

This would mean that she was introduced to the public as a straight woman and would be a straight woman in the public consciousness throughout her career. This would complicate coming out later since it’s hard to veer from what the public already believes once a celebrity’s public image is well-established. If she had been out from the beginning, or if she had come out early in her career- the PR strategy would be much less complicated because the general public would be much more accepting. 

Throughout her career, Taylor has been the target of much misogyny-related criticism. This includes an endless reporting on the guys she was rumored to have dated. The existence of most of these relationships is considered to be factual- even by her fans- but only a few have been confirmed. Taylor herself has stated that she has not actually dated many of the guys that people think she has dated. Since we (on a sociological level) assume that everyone is straight by default until they specifically state otherwise, it was reported that she was dating a guy even if there was only minimal evidence. It was not, however, reported that she was dating a woman (even with a huge amount of evidence). This constant reporting on her love life in the media has established her as a serial dater in the public consciousness but also has firmly established her as a straight woman in the public consciousness. Her massive success throughout her career means that she is firmly rooted as an A-list celebrity and, therefore, her public image is also firmly rooted. And the public thinks she is straight. Once that public image is in place, it’s hard to change it without a massive amount of criticism and accusations that she is faking it for attention, sales, or continued relevancy. Her PR team almost certainly knows that it would be much more delicate with her than with someone who is earlier in their career or who is less well-known than her. Demi Lovato’s career, for example, was majorly harmed recently by coming out as non-binary after already having been firmly established in the public consciousness as a woman.

With the release of the Lover album in 2019, Taylor seems to have been attempting a coming out. Her record contract with her former label had ended, and therefore so did their conservative hold on her career. This would create a perfect opportunity for her to be more authentic in her art. I imagine her PR team discussed ‘soft launch’ vs. ‘hard launch’ coming outs. Soft launch being the Joan Jett style coming out where she just starts being publicly gay without making an explicit statement to the public that she is and hard launch meaning making a public statement. She appears to reference the soft launch strategy in ‘The Great War’ with the ‘crimson and clover’ line (Joan Jett released her cover of the song ‘Crimson and Clover’ in 1981- with female pronouns- as part of her own soft launch coming out). Lovers' accompanying documentary (Miss Americana) and the album itself were likely made with both of these strategy options in mind. There’s evidence that Miss Americana was meant to be about her coming out as gay and NOT about her coming out as political. Not only is she shown writing and recording “ME!”- which is likely meant to be a gay pride anthem- but she describes her vision of the music video for it as including “all the things that make me me” in parade form and includes ‘gay pride’ as one of the things that make her her. The music video itself shows her and Brendon Urie (an openly bisexual man) walking down the street while Brendon is throwing the bisexual pride colors at windows and streetlights spiderman-style and Taylors' dress bleeds the same colors. The gay pride rainbow is overhead during much of the parade and it’s worth mentioning that parades are often associated with queerness because of gay pride parades. At one point, he proposes to her but she declines in favor of petting a kitten (aka she turned down a guy because she’d rather have p\*\*\*y). In Karma, she says “karma is a cat purring in my lap because it loves me”- or does it love ME! the song? The song itself is a self-loving anthem and included the now removed line “spelling is fun” which appears to have been a subtle reference to the use of letters for identifying queerness (""LGBTQ+""). 

The documentary is set up in a way where it could just as easily have been a coming out documentary instead of a “coming out as political” documentary. First, it doesn’t even make sense that she would need a documentary just to make a public statement about her political stance on a local Tennessee candidate- which is what the version that was released to the public basically was. The concept of the documentary *does* make sense in the context of coming as gay or bisexual. All the talk about being a perfect, good girl and role model makes more sense in the context of why she wouldn’t come out sooner.

Another single from the album (You Need To Calm Down) may have gotten its title from a phrase that she was previously told by her management under her former record label when she was too open or obvious with her queerness. I believe a lot of things she was told ended up in songs as a cheeky reference to them. For example, “being too loud”- as in being too loud/open about her queerness- is in You Need To Calm Down and  again in The Last Great American Dynasty where she uses it in reference to both herself and Rebecca Harkness. These lines may have been included in YNTCD as way of saying that it’s not *her* who should calm down and be less loud but the people who would have a problem with her being gay that should. Throughout YNTCD, and throughout the Lover album and even in later albums, she uses light/dark imagery as a metaphor for being in closeted vs. being openly gay. “There’s sunshine on the street at the parade, but you would rather be in the dark ages” and “shade never made anybody less gay”, etc. In the music video, she burns down the trailer of heteronormativity and instead joins a bunch of LGBTQ+ celebrities in a gated trailer park community (literally meant to represent the LGBTQ+ community) that has a banner of pride flags over the entrance. She does this whilst wearing the bisexual pride colors in her hair. At the end of the video, she lovingly meets up with a woman who is the hamburger to her french fries (they’re in hamburger/french fry costumes) and they hold hands and stare into each other’s eyes. Not to mention the fact that the lyrics of the song includes herself as one of the people who shade never made less gay. The colors on the Lover album cover are blue, purple, and pink- the bisexual pride colors. 

Lover was set to be released in August of 2019 but in June of 2019, Taylor’s masters to her first 6 albums were sold to Scooter Braun’s Ithaca Holdings. I’m sure most Taylor Swift fans know why this was an issue but just to recap: Taylor wanted to buy the masters from her previous record label, and they would only sell them under unfair terms that included staying with them and releasing more albums on their label and earning them back one by one. She chose to decline that offer since she wanted independence from her label and to own all future work. Scooter Braun was manager of Kanye West and assisted with his attempted canceling of Taylor. When Taylor refused to stay with her previous record label, it’s likely that they sold her masters to Scooter as an insidious way of punishing her for not staying with them. This sale happened two months before Lover was set to be released. Taylor wanted to speak out publicly about this and announce that she intended to re-record her earlier work but it was likely decided among her PR team that doing that AND coming out would be too much major media exposure at one time and would disastrously result in neither being taken seriously. She chose to switch the hard launch coming out for the soft launch instead and publicly announced her intention to re-record her masters. By this time, the ME! and YNTCD songs and music videos (which were likely supposed to be part of the hard launch strategy in the form that they were released in) were already released but the album and documentary had not been. 

In June, after the sale of her masters, Cautious Clay was contacted about making a last-minute approval to sample one of his songs for the song “London Boy”. This implies that London Boy was a last-minute addition to album *after* the masters were sold ([https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/how-cautious-clay-ended-up-on-taylor-swifts-lover-881709/](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/how-cautious-clay-ended-up-on-taylor-swifts-lover-881709/)) and, therefore, *after* she made the decision to stop her hard launch coming out. This song was probably included to makeup for a song that was removed that was too explicitly gay to be included now or to just add an overall sense of straightness to the album. The song itself feels like a cheeky parody and includes a sample of Idris Alba saying “go riding on my scooter” which was taken from a talk show where someone had won a date with him. Many think this is a subtle way of implying that the relationship described in the song is fake.

Before the sale of her masters, Taylor made a surprise performance at a Stonewall Inn pride event on June 14th. She was rumored to attend the NYC Worldpride event on June 30th (after the sale of her master’s) as well, but she never made it to that event. Designer Christian Siriano made a rainbow dress that was likely originally meant for Taylor to wear to this event but was worn by Billy Porter instead. If Taylor was previously planning to make a coming out speech, it likely would have been at this event. Instead, an interview with Vogue magazine was published on August 8th where Taylor made a statement to effect of “I can advocate for communities that I’m not a part of”. This was probably done as narrative control since she had put a stop to her full coming out and the statement was intentionally vague as to whether she was a part of the LGBTQ+ community herself. This is often used as the main piece of evidence that she is straight, even though it was quite vague and LGBTQ+ is comprised of many different communities. 

The album was then released in August of 2019 without any grand statements of queerness. The Miss Americana documentary was released in January of 2020 with only minor statements of queerness (“gay pride makes me, me”) that may have been left in intentionally or may have just slipped passed the editors when making the gay vs. non-gay versions of it. They couldn’t pull the release of the documentary all together because its' release had already been announced to her fans and she had a contract with the production company to release it- so it became a “Taylor Swift comes out as political” thing.

Unfortunately, many people misinterpreted the queer flagging of this era. She was seen as a problematic ally who includes herself way too much in the narrative of LGBTQ+ rights, instead of this self-inclusion being seen as her saying she is part of the community. The line “shade never made anybody less gay” was a double meaning metaphor (people talking shit vs. being in the closet) that many misinterpreted and many thought she was simply comparing “talking shit” to homophobia, which reduced its' credibility in the eyes of many. Later, in the song Paris (a song about having a beautiful gay love “in the shade”), she clarified: it’s not the kind that’s thrown, it’s the kind under where a tree has grown. The light/dark imagery of the song and album support that narrative as well. ME! suffered the fate of not being recognized as the gay anthem it was meant to be and was interpreted as childish instead.

After this, her subsequent work was released with accompanying media material that appeared to attempt to control the narrative of the songs. For example, the very gay sounding ‘Folklore’ album was accompanied by the release of The Long Pond Studio Sessions that described the album as mostly fictional and “from a male perspective”. The body language and facial expressions of her and Jack Antonoff in this documentary appear to indicate that they are not telling the truth much of the time and are a bit amused at the narrative that they are telling. Midnights was accompanied by several Instagram reels. One of these reels discussed the song Lavender Haze and described it as a love song whose title comes from a beautiful 1950s saying about love. The song itself is slightly in opposition to that description with lines admonishing “that 1950s shit”- which supports the idea that the reels were intended for narrative control. I think the idea of staying ""in that lavender haze"" actually comes from what you get when you blend the bisexual pride colors together. Maybe her previous record label/PR team wouldn’t let her use the bisexual pride colors in her performances/social media posts/etc. but would let her blend them together in a vaguer way so that the intended queer flagging wasn’t as obvious. This would mean that ‘staying in that lavender haze’ is a metaphor for being closeted. 

If Taylor plans on coming out in the future, it’s likely that the PR strategy will be a slow buildup to it. Currently, a large portion of her fan base have taken it upon themselves to aggressively defend her straightness. I’m sure there’s concern that this would result in a massive cognitive dissonance response from those fans if she were to come out. The best way for her to proceed would be to keep “dropping hairpins” until the majority of her fanbase is at least accepting of Gaylor theory, even if they don’t personally believe it. The goal would be to gradually make it less and less deniable and only then make a public statement. She does seem to be using this strategy in the Midnights era. The Gaylor theory has many new converts in her fanbase and that amount of converts in slowly growing every day. Once enough of her fans have been converted, only then will she make a grand public statement.

And with this, I leave you a poem:

I can see you

I can see right through you

You don’t have to answer,

Just because they asked you

If you prefer hiding in plain sight,

That’s ok

You can just stay

In that lavender haze

But there’s sunshine on the street at the parade

And shade never made anybody less gay

And not the kind that’s thrown,

But the kind under where a tree has grown

So if you remember that you’re a rainbow with all of the colors

Midnights don’t have to become your afternoons

When you step out into the daylight,

You’ll be remembered for the things that you love

And I know it’s delicate, like clover

But it’s golden, like daylight

I can see you

9. Zero Remix - improves on the original in practically every way, and JID’s verse is cool.
10. Hurt -   I liked this song a lot, but there’s version I prefer so much more and it’s not sung by New Jeans.
11. ASAP -   it’s very interesting sounding, albeit a little repetitive, but the choreo does raise it up a bit in ranking.
12. Get Up -   don’t get it twisted, this song could’ve easily been top 5 had it actually been an actual song.
13. New Jeans - it’s a cool vibe, it just feels like it doesn’t go anywhere with it (it’s an intro, so yeah)
14. Zero -   I did not have as much of a problem with the chorus as a lot of people did, but the remix is still way better.
15. Gods -   It’s a great song and they did so well with such a different sound, but it just doesn’t feel like NewJeans.

21127,"I'm not sure if this will be allowed here, but I wanted to give it a shot. I LOVE 1989 (Taylor's Version), but the buzzing has been driving me up the wall and making it borderline unlistenable for me. So, with more determination than I've ever had in my life, I tried to fix it as someone who knows nothing about producing or audio engineering.

The buzzing is at a frequency of about 15kHz, which explains why not everyone can hear it. Here's a spectrogram from Audacity of Clean toward the beginning, with a portion of the track that has buzzing in it selected:

https://preview.redd.it/t02cown8i2xb1.png?width=2838&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e8d92e957500a4d5a72afc075b17d3382fdeb67

That horizontal line around 15,000Hz at the top shouldn't be there. Here's another screenshot of the spectrogram after I applied a notch filter of 15,000Hz with a Q value of 2.0 (I have no idea what I'm really talking about, I think I sound like a toddler explaining this right now to people who know this stuff lol):

https://preview.redd.it/cbubd84bi2xb1.png?width=2842&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c47839b855e80bd1c6a23f273c39ab80ffff960

After doing that, I can still hear it a little bit, but it's not nearly as loud as it was before. I thought deleting anything above 15kHz muffled her voice too much, but maybe I'm wrong and I'm just overanalyzing it.

I used Audacity to do this, but because I'm on a Mac I also had to use Soundflower and Audio MIDI Setup to actually record the song with Audacity so I could edit it.

I tried this on Style and it worked pretty well there too, although I applied the notch filter to the whole song instead of doing it properly and only applying it to the sections with the buzzing. If you apply the filter to the entire track, you risk cutting out stuff that was actually supposed to be there. I don't know if this will be helpful to anyone, but I'm glad I finally figured it all out!

Edit: I don't know why I just thought to do this, but I doubled up the notch filter in the area I could still hear static—right before she starts singing—and it went away completely. This is what it looks like now:

I LOVE 1989 (Taylor's Version), but the buzzing has been driving me up the wall and making it borderline unlistenable for me. So, with more determination than I've ever had in my life, I tried to fix it as someone who knows nothing about producing or audio engineering.

The buzzing is at a frequency of about 15kHz, which explains why not everyone can hear it. Here's a spectrogram from Audacity of Clean toward the beginning, with a portion of the track that has buzzing in it selected:



That horizontal line around 15,000Hz at the top shouldn't be there. Here's another screenshot of the spectrogram after I applied a notch filter of 15,000Hz with a Q value of 2.0 (I have no idea what I'm really talking about, I think I sound like a toddler explaining this right now to people who know this stuff lol):



After doing that, I can still hear it a little bit, but it's not nearly as loud as it was before. I thought deleting anything above 15kHz muffled her voice too much, but maybe I'm wrong and I'm just overanalyzing it.

I used Audacity to do this, but because I'm on a Mac I also had to use Soundflower and Audio MIDI Setup to actually record the song with Audacity so I could edit it.

I tried this on Style and it worked pretty well there too, although I applied the notch filter to the whole song instead of doing it properly and only applying it to the sections with the buzzing. If you apply the filter to the entire track, you risk cutting out stuff that was actually supposed to be there. I don't know if this will be helpful to anyone, but I'm glad I finally figured it all out!

Edit: I don't know why I just thought to do this, but I doubled up the notch filter in the area I could still hear static—right before she starts singing—and it went away completely. This is what it looks like now:



Edit 2: Also! If you do this, I'd recommend exporting to a lossless format like FLAC or ALAC, depending on if you're using a Mac or not (FLAC doesn't work with Apple streaming services 💔).",people hear buzzingstatic ersion fix mostly im sure allow want gie shot loe ersion buzzing driing wall make borderline unlistenable deteination ie eer life tri fix someone know nothing produce audio engineering buzzing frequency khz explains eeryone hear here spectrogram audacity clean toward begin portion track buzzing select horizontal line around hz top shouldnt here another screenshot spectrogram appli notch filter hz q alue hae idea im really talk think sound like toddler explain right people know stuff lol still hear little bit nearly loud thought delete anything aboe khz muffl oice much maybe im wrong im oeranalyzing us audacity im mac also use soundflower audio midi setup actually record song audacity could tri style work pretty well although appli notch filter whole song instead properly apply section buzzing apply filter entire track risk cut stuff actually suppos dont know helpful anyone im glad finally figur dont know thought doubl notch filter area could still hear staticright start singingand go away completely look like also id recommend export lossless foat like flac alac depend youre use mac flac doesnt work apple stream serices,8,"Music and Lyrics: Discussions and reflections on the emotional and personal impact of music, including how lyrics relate to relationships, identity, and cultural experiences."

251,"I’ve been a huge fan of Taylor Swift for a long time but I’ve only recently started collecting vinyl again. I’ve already bought a few of her albums on vinyl but have just got the ‘normal versions’ and not paid a fortune for any of them (even long pond!).

12898,"**Here’s Everything You Need To Know About Taylor Swift And Olivia Rodrigo’s Rumored Feud Amid Speculation That “Vampire” Is About Taylor**

Olivia’s new song is all about feeling used and blindsided by somebody that she once loved, and it has now been argued that her former idol Taylor could be the inspiration.

On Friday, Olivia Rodrigo released “Vampire” — the much-anticipated lead single from her upcoming second album, Guts.

And it’s fair to say that the song has been incredibly well-received, with Olivia’s new music on track to meet the same dizzying heights that she enjoyed with her debut album Sour in 2021.

**In a press release for “Vampire,” Olivia said that she wrote it because she was “upset about a certain situation” and when she went to the studio and sat down at the piano alone in December, “the chords, melody, and lyrics just poured out” of her.**

**“It’s a song about feeling confused and hurt,” she summarized. And on Instagram, the star said that it was “very cathartic” to finish it as she wrote: “writing this song helped me sort through lots of feelings of regret, anger, and heartache.**

**Olivia went on to tell fans: “I hope it helps u deal with any bloodsuckers in your life.”**

Considering the use of the word ""guy"" in the track, it’s unsurprising that listeners immediately attributed the inspiration behind it to Olivia’s ex, Adam Faze.

The relationship sparked controversy when it was first reported in 2021 due to the age gap between the two. Olivia was just 18 years old at the time, and producer Adam was 24.

This appears to be alluded to in “Vampire” with the lyrics: “Went for me and not her ‘cause girls your age know better.”

**But shortly after the song’s release, a source close to Olivia bluntly told People: “The song isn’t about Adam Faze.**”

**And it wasn’t long before fans started to read between the lines and realize that the lyrics could actually be related to Olivia’s rumored feud with her former idol, Taylor Swift.**

**“Sorry but no one can convince me that song isn’t about Taylor Swift being the bloodsucker/vampire she’s singing about but she’s masking it by making it seem it’s about a boy,” one person tweeted after its release.**

And the sentiment was widely shared, with another writing: “Olivia’s new song vampire is about Taylor swift!!!! Don’t tell me otherwise.” A third added: “the more i listen to vampire im convinced it’s about taylor swift.”

The theory has also made its way over to TikTok, but to understand it we first need to recap what happened between the two singers.

In case you didn’t know, Olivia started out as a Disney actor in the late 2010s, and starred in shows like High School Music: The Musical: The Series before turning her attention to music in 2021, when she was 17 years old.

Amid the promo around her debut single “Driver’s License,” Olivia made no secret of the fact that she was largely inspired by Taylor. In fact, during an interview with Capital FM, she called herself “the biggest Swiftie in the whole world.”

And when “Driver’s License” charted at number three on iTunes, directly below two of Taylor’s songs, Olivia proudly shared a screenshot to Instagram and wrote: “next to taylor on the us i tunes chart i’m in a puddle of tears.”

Taylor sweetly reciprocated the affection by commenting on the post: “I say that’s my baby and I’m proud.” Olivia reacted by posting a screenshot of the comment with the caption: “What is breathing?”

Taylor later shared a video of Olivia singing to her Instagram story and wrote: “THE TALENT,” which Olivia also reposted in utter disbelief that Taylor — who she credited as “the reason” she is a songwriter — had posted her and told her that she was talented.

After this, the friendship between the two singers appeared to be going from strength to strength, with Taylor even sending Olivia a handwritten note and gifts.

During an interview with Ryan Seacrest, Olivia said: “She gave me this ring because she said she wore one just like it when she wrote Red and she wanted me to have one like it and all of this amazing stuff, she’s like hand-wrapped these gifts.”

And the two finally met in person at the Brit Awards in May 2021, where they posed for an adorable photo together that Olivia shared to Instagram with the simple caption: “🥺🥺🥺🥺”

When her debut album Sour came out just days later, Taylor’s musical influence over Olivia’s work was at its most apparent in her song ""1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back,” which credits Taylor after using an interpolation of her track “New Year’s Day.”

Olivia discussed how this came to be in a subsequent interview with Zach Sang, where she explained: “I came up with the '1 Step Forward' concept and I sort of wrote a verse and a chorus. I was in the car on a road trip, and when I got home, I decided to sing it over the chords of 'New Year's Day.’”

“I think they're really beautiful chords. I was lucky enough to get that approved, and it's on the record,” she added.

While this interpolation was authorized by Taylor’s team and dutifully credited by Olivia, in July — weeks after Sour’s release — fans noticed that Taylor had been retroactively credited on Olivia’s blockbuster single “Deja Vu.”

Taylor and her collaborators Jack Antonoff and St. Vincent’s names were added alongside Olivia’s and songwriter-producer Dan Nigro. This addition was apparently due to the reported interpolation of Taylor’s song “Cruel Summer” in the hit, although this appears to be much less noticeable than the “1 Step Forward” example.

Then in September, Paramore's Hayley Williams — who is close friends with Taylor — and Joshua Farro were retroactively given songwriting credits on Olivia’s hit single “Good 4 U” because of the similarities it shares with Paramore's 2007 single ""Misery Business.”

**Billboard later reported that with the credits Olivia had given up a huge sum of money in royalties, with Taylor, Jack, and St. Vincent said to receive a combined share of 50% of the royalties for “Deja Vu,” and Hayley and Joshua receiving an estimated combined share of 50% for “Good 4 U.”**

**And while the entire situation unfolded in private, other artists came forward to defend Olivia amid the claims that she’d ripped off other artist**

**When the teen star was accused of copying a guitar riff from one of Elvis Costello’s songs in her track “Brutal” he tweeted: “It's how rock and roll works. You take the broken pieces of another thrill and make a brand new toy. That's what I did.""**

And Adam Levine also discussed the music industry “gray area.” He said: “These are tricky things and anyone who's ever written a song knows that you rip something off inadvertently, and it makes it to tape, and then it's released and then there's a lawsuit.”

""Sometimes it's not warranted that people take legal action. And I think there's definitely become more of a gray area that's reared its ugly head these days,” he went on. ""I do think that we should probably meet this with a little more compassion and understanding and try to find a way… All this calling out, it's like, music is a creative thing and I just hate to see it crushed.""

**Olivia did not publicly address the situation at the time, but in a Rolling Stone interview with Alanis Morissette in October 2021, the two women bonded over encountering “mean girls” in the industry.**

Looking back on her early success, Alanis told Olivia: “There was a lot of bullying and a lot of jealousy and a lot of people whom I’d adored my whole life being mean girls,” to which Olivia replied: “Same!”

**Things seemingly worsened between Taylor and Olivia when the 2022 Grammy nominations were released the following month. After Billie Eilish in 2020, Olivia became the second youngest artist to be nominated in all four of the general categories in the same ceremony — including the much-coveted “Album of the Year.”**

Because of their credits on two of Olivia’s songs, Taylor and Jack initially received nominations alongside Olivia’s team for Sour, in addition to Taylor’s personal nomination for her album Evermor

**However, the Recording Academy later backtracked and said that Taylor and Jack’s names were a submission error in relation to Sour because they weren’t actively involved in the creation of the songs on the album.**

**""Last week, we received the correct credits from the label that recognize Annie Clark \[St. Vincent\], Jack Antonoff and Taylor Swift as songwriters of an interpolation on the track 'Deja Vu,’” the Academy said in a statement in December 2021. “In keeping with current Grammy guidelines, as songwriters of an interpolated track, Clark, Antonoff and Swift are not nominees in the album of the year category for Sour.”**

While neither Taylor or Olivia ended up winning this particular award, the whole debacle sparked speculation of a rift and fans have noted that the two have not publicly interacted since.

**Although Olivia hasn’t directly addressed Taylor or Hayley over the song credit situation, shortly after the Grammys’s nomination withdrawal she admitted to Time: “It was really frustrating to see people discredit and deny my creativity.”**

**Her producer Dan pointedly added to the publication: ""It seems like people get funny about things when songs become really popular.""**

**And the rumor that Taylor and Olivia had fallen out was fueled earlier this year when they didn’t pose for a photo together at the Grammys — despite Taylor being pictured with several of her fellow artists.**

Taylor has also been growing closer to Sabrina Carpenter, who was largely speculated to be Olivia’s love rival during her Sour era and is even believed to be “the blonde girl” that Olivia references in “Driver’s License.”

Shortly before Olivia announced “Vampire,” Taylor revealed that Sabrina — who she referred to as a “sweet angel princess” would be joining her on her international Eras tour as a special guest.

So, with all of that in mind it’s perhaps unsurprising that some believe that Olivia’s lyrics about feeling used and blindsided by somebody that she once loved could be about her former idol.

Not to mention that the entire concept of being bled dry by a “vampire” could be a metaphor for the money that Taylor made from securing a credit on one of Olivia’s biggest hits.

**In the opening lyrics, Olivia accuses the subject of her song of building a “castle” out of people that they “pretend to care about,” which could easily be correlated to the royalties that Taylor banked from “Deja Vu” after feigning friendship with Olivia.**

“I loved you truly,” Olivia sings. “Gotta laugh at the stupidity.”

**And with “Vampire” being written in December of last year, the reference to someone who only comes out at night could be a nod to Taylor’s most recent album, Midnights, which was released in October and she described as being a recollection of “sleepless nights” that she’d written in the “middle of the night.**”

**“I used to think I was smart / But you made me look so naive / The way you sold me for parts / As you sunk your teeth into me,” Olivia goes on, with being sold for parts a possible analogy to the way that her work was given away.**

“Oh, bloodsucker, famefucker / Bleeding me dry like a goddamn vampire,” the chorus concludes.

**In the second verse, Olivia sings about being warned that the subject of her song was “bad, bad news” and her regret at believing their defense that all of their critics were “crazy.”**

**And self-proclaimed “mastermind” Taylor has previously confessed that her reputation precedes her, which makes it plausible that after almost two decades in the industry there are people who might speak out against her to upcoming new singers.**

**“You're so convincing / How do you lie without flinching?” Olivia asks, with her follow-up lyric “Went for me and not her / Cause girls your age know better” a potential reference to her being an easy target because she is a young and inexperienced artist compared to veterans in the industry who may be harder to manipulate.**

And while Olivia’s later reference to “true love” was initially perceived to be about romantic love, it is just as possible that it is a reference to the friendship that she and Taylor shared at the start of her music career.

“You can't love anyone / Cause that would mean you had a heart,” Olivia sings. In a possible reference to Taylor's shrewd business mind, she adds: “How you think’s the kind of thing I’ll never understand.”

**While neither Olivia or Taylor have acknowledged the “Vampire” theory, it is certainly growing traction online. One person tweeted: “i wish my brain would stop analyzing vampire lyrics in relation to taylor swift i am ill.”**

**Someone else asked: “why was olivia rodrigo's vampire being about taylor swift my first thought?” and one more added: “so we’re all in agreement that vampire is about Taylor Swift right.”**

**But shortly after the song’s release, a source close to Olivia bluntly told People: “The song isn’t about Adam Faze.**”

**And it wasn’t long before fans started to read between the lines and realize that the lyrics could actually be related to Olivia’s rumored feud with her former idol, Taylor Swift.**

**“Sorry but no one can convince me that song isn’t about Taylor Swift being the bloodsucker/vampire she’s singing about but she’s masking it by making it seem it’s about a boy,” one person tweeted after its release.**

And the sentiment was widely shared, with another writing: “Olivia’s new song vampire is about Taylor swift!!!! Don’t tell me otherwise.” A third added: “the more i listen to vampire im convinced it’s about taylor swift.”

The theory has also made its way over to TikTok, but to understand it we first need to recap what happened between the two singers.

In case you didn’t know, Olivia started out as a Disney actor in the late 2010s, and starred in shows like High School Music: The Musical: The Series before turning her attention to music in 2021, when she was 17 years old.

Amid the promo around her debut single “Driver’s License,” Olivia made no secret of the fact that she was largely inspired by Taylor. In fact, during an interview with Capital FM, she called herself “the biggest Swiftie in the whole world.”

And when “Driver’s License” charted at number three on iTunes, directly below two of Taylor’s songs, Olivia proudly shared a screenshot to Instagram and wrote: “next to taylor on the us i tunes chart i’m in a puddle of tears.”

Taylor sweetly reciprocated the affection by commenting on the post: “I say that’s my baby and I’m proud.” Olivia reacted by posting a screenshot of the comment with the caption: “What is breathing?”

Taylor later shared a video of Olivia singing to her Instagram story and wrote: “THE TALENT,” which Olivia also reposted in utter disbelief that Taylor — who she credited as “the reason” she is a songwriter — had posted her and told her that she was talented.

After this, the friendship between the two singers appeared to be going from strength to strength, with Taylor even sending Olivia a handwritten note and gifts.

During an interview with Ryan Seacrest, Olivia said: “She gave me this ring because she said she wore one just like it when she wrote Red and she wanted me to have one like it and all of this amazing stuff, she’s like hand-wrapped these gifts.”

And the two finally met in person at the Brit Awards in May 2021, where they posed for an adorable photo together that Olivia shared to Instagram with the simple caption: “🥺🥺🥺🥺”

When her debut album Sour came out just days later, Taylor’s musical influence over Olivia’s work was at its most apparent in her song ""1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back,” which credits Taylor after using an interpolation of her track “New Year’s Day.”

Olivia discussed how this came to be in a subsequent interview with Zach Sang, where she explained: “I came up with the '1 Step Forward' concept and I sort of wrote a verse and a chorus. I was in the car on a road trip, and when I got home, I decided to sing it over the chords of 'New Year's Day.’”

“I think they're really beautiful chords. I was lucky enough to get that approved, and it's on the record,” she added.

While this interpolation was authorized by Taylor’s team and dutifully credited by Olivia, in July — weeks after Sour’s release — fans noticed that Taylor had been retroactively credited on Olivia’s blockbuster single “Deja Vu.”

Taylor and her collaborators Jack Antonoff and St. Vincent’s names were added alongside Olivia’s and songwriter-producer Dan Nigro. This addition was apparently due to the reported interpolation of Taylor’s song “Cruel Summer” in the hit, although this appears to be much less noticeable than the “1 Step Forward” example.

Then in September, Paramore's Hayley Williams — who is close friends with Taylor — and Joshua Farro were retroactively given songwriting credits on Olivia’s hit single “Good 4 U” because of the similarities it shares with Paramore's 2007 single ""Misery Business.”

**Billboard later reported that with the credits Olivia had given up a huge sum of money in royalties, with Taylor, Jack, and St. Vincent said to receive a combined share of 50% of the royalties for “Deja Vu,” and Hayley and Joshua receiving an estimated combined share of 50% for “Good 4 U.”**

**And while the entire situation unfolded in private, other artists came forward to defend Olivia amid the claims that she’d ripped off other artist**

**When the teen star was accused of copying a guitar riff from one of Elvis Costello’s songs in her track “Brutal” he tweeted: “It's how rock and roll works. You take the broken pieces of another thrill and make a brand new toy. That's what I did.""**

And Adam Levine also discussed the music industry “gray area.” He said: “These are tricky things and anyone who's ever written a song knows that you rip something off inadvertently, and it makes it to tape, and then it's released and then there's a lawsuit.”

""Sometimes it's not warranted that people take legal action. And I think there's definitely become more of a gray area that's reared its ugly head these days,” he went on. ""I do think that we should probably meet this with a little more compassion and understanding and try to find a way… All this calling out, it's like, music is a creative thing and I just hate to see it crushed.""

**Olivia did not publicly address the situation at the time, but in a Rolling Stone interview with Alanis Morissette in October 2021, the two women bonded over encountering “mean girls” in the industry.**

Looking back on her early success, Alanis told Olivia: “There was a lot of bullying and a lot of jealousy and a lot of people whom I’d adored my whole life being mean girls,” to which Olivia replied: “Same!”

**Things seemingly worsened between Taylor and Olivia when the 2022 Grammy nominations were released the following month. After Billie Eilish in 2020, Olivia became the second youngest artist to be nominated in all four of the general categories in the same ceremony — including the much-coveted “Album of the Year.”**

Because of their credits on two of Olivia’s songs, Taylor and Jack initially received nominations alongside Olivia’s team for Sour, in addition to Taylor’s personal nomination for her album Evermor

**However, the Recording Academy later backtracked and said that Taylor and Jack’s names were a submission error in relation to Sour because they weren’t actively involved in the creation of the songs on the album.**

**""Last week, we received the correct credits from the label that recognize Annie Clark \[St. Vincent\], Jack Antonoff and Taylor Swift as songwriters of an interpolation on the track 'Deja Vu,’” the Academy said in a statement in December 2021. “In keeping with current Grammy guidelines, as songwriters of an interpolated track, Clark, Antonoff and Swift are not nominees in the album of the year category for Sour.”**

While neither Taylor or Olivia ended up winning this particular award, the whole debacle sparked speculation of a rift and fans have noted that the two have not publicly interacted since.

**Although Olivia hasn’t directly addressed Taylor or Hayley over the song credit situation, shortly after the Grammys’s nomination withdrawal she admitted to Time: “It was really frustrating to see people discredit and deny my creativity.”**

**Her producer Dan pointedly added to the publication: ""It seems like people get funny about things when songs become really popular.""**

**And the rumor that Taylor and Olivia had fallen out was fueled earlier this year when they didn’t pose for a photo together at the Grammys — despite Taylor being pictured with several of her fellow artists.**

Taylor has also been growing closer to Sabrina Carpenter, who was largely speculated to be Olivia’s love rival during her Sour era and is even believed to be “the blonde girl” that Olivia references in “Driver’s License.”

Shortly before Olivia announced “Vampire,” Taylor revealed that Sabrina — who she referred to as a “sweet angel princess” would be joining her on her international Eras tour as a special guest.

So, with all of that in mind it’s perhaps unsurprising that some believe that Olivia’s lyrics about feeling used and blindsided by somebody that she once loved could be about her former idol.

Not to mention that the entire concept of being bled dry by a “vampire” could be a metaphor for the money that Taylor made from securing a credit on one of Olivia’s biggest hits.

**In the opening lyrics, Olivia accuses the subject of her song of building a “castle” out of people that they “pretend to care about,” which could easily be correlated to the royalties that Taylor banked from “Deja Vu” after feigning friendship with Olivia.**

“I loved you truly,” Olivia sings. “Gotta laugh at the stupidity.”

**And with “Vampire” being written in December of last year, the reference to someone who only comes out at night could be a nod to Taylor’s most recent album, Midnights, which was released in October and she described as being a recollection of “sleepless nights” that she’d written in the “middle of the night.**”

**“I used to think I was smart / But you made me look so naive / The way you sold me for parts / As you sunk your teeth into me,” Olivia goes on, with being sold for parts a possible analogy to the way that her work was given away.**

“Oh, bloodsucker, famefucker / Bleeding me dry like a goddamn vampire,” the chorus concludes.

**In the second verse, Olivia sings about being warned that the subject of her song was “bad, bad news” and her regret at believing their defense that all of their critics were “crazy.”**

**And self-proclaimed “mastermind” Taylor has previously confessed that her reputation precedes her, which makes it plausible that after almost two decades in the industry there are people who might speak out against her to upcoming new singers.**

**“You're so convincing / How do you lie without flinching?” Olivia asks, with her follow-up lyric “Went for me and not her / Cause girls your age know better” a potential reference to her being an easy target because she is a young and inexperienced artist compared to veterans in the industry who may be harder to manipulate.**

And while Olivia’s later reference to “true love” was initially perceived to be about romantic love, it is just as possible that it is a reference to the friendship that she and Taylor shared at the start of her music career.

“You can't love anyone / Cause that would mean you had a heart,” Olivia sings. In a possible reference to Taylor's shrewd business mind, she adds: “How you think’s the kind of thing I’ll never understand.”

**While neither Olivia or Taylor have acknowledged the “Vampire” theory, it is certainly growing traction online. One person tweeted: “i wish my brain would stop analyzing vampire lyrics in relation to taylor swift i am ill.”**

**Someone else asked: “why was olivia rodrigo's vampire being about taylor swift my first thought?” and one more added: “so we’re all in agreement that vampire is about Taylor Swift right.”**

18567,"You know how there's a phoenix in the Harry Potter movies? Fawkes? He belongs to Dumbledore?

Phoenix tears are said to have incredible healing properties. I've always connected that to these line - 

'Do I throw out everything we've built or keep it

**I'm getting tired even for a phoenix**

**Always rising from the ashes**

**Mending all the gashes**

**You might just have dealt the final blow'**

The thing about Phoenix tears is that they're very, very potent - even against something as powerful as Basilisk venom. 

The imagery that appeared in my head was Taylor wearing a white dress. Every time they fight and break up, a large red stain appears on the front of her dress - her heart is bleeding. But her tears eventually fall onto the gash and heal it, and the stain disappears.

The last, the final time that it happened before they broke up for good, her tears just kept flowing but didn't heal the gash. The final blow.

5138,"Okay, I am here to speak about what I am not seeing about the KOI FISH!

After the Lavender Haze music video was released, everyone was picking up the Koi fish and connecting it to the Speak Now (TV) release.
But why would she make a whole MV that will go on in history just to show us what rerelalse is coming next in 2023???

The question is, what did the Koi fish mean during the Speak Now era? And WHY is she connecting it to her LAVENDER HAZE song from Midnights.

Hypothesis: (The Lavender Haze (bearding contract/relationship) she is living through in Midnights is peaceful and accepting of her melancholia and just what she wants from a HAZE ""I just wanna stay in this Lavender Haze"" 
And 
The Lavender Haze (bearding contract/relationship) she had in Speak Now was NOT IT. It added to her melancholia, and he didn't understand her....


Interesting: In this interview, Taylor talks about having a koi pond in her house but that she actually wanted stingrays! (
https://www.mtv.com/news/bbf8ir/taylor-swifts-real-life-home-vs-her-back-to-december-pad)

Now:
Think of the Koi fish as a representation of her beard/PR relationship/whatever you want to call it. The person we see her dating.

I also think of a few themes for the Koi fish in the Speak Now era:
- The obvious: strength, patience, and success through preserverance.
- The fishbowl theory and the fact that all Taylor's lovers will live in the fishbowl with her.
- Koi fish swim against the current. Taylor's love can be seen as this (whether it is queer love or relationships with bad boys: it's against what is preferred)
- Koi tattoos are also a way to let people know your sexual orientation. (Yes, i think the koi is her beard)

I believe that Taylor sees herself as a fish in a fishbowl, and she does want to live her life outside of the fishbowl. Or at least in such a way that she has peace within her fishbowl/with her fish.(her Kois and stingrays 😆 que the photo of Karlie Kloss and Calvin Harris in Taylor's kitchen!) 
(This, for me, is where she is pushing down the walls in LH music video to sleep peacefully with her fish in her melancholia. Her current lover's back in bed is the same as where she ends up peacefully at the end of the MV.)


And to me, Speak Now was her most successful bearding era. But her saddest. 
The one where she wrote songs about Martin Johnson, had a PR with John Mayer, and to this DAY Swifties believe all songs are for John Mayer.
(If you don't know about Martin Johnson, pause and go look it up!)

I think the PR with John Mayer caused her a lot of hurt (or, let's say, melancholia) after the hurt she already experienced with Martin Johnson. 

And that's because I think Taylor has always wanted her PR relationship to be more than a contract. And she had and lost a real even though quick relationship with JM.(and so with all her other beards as well. They didn't mean ""nothing"" to her. Humans have feelings) 

And as a human it is only natural to want to have the someone by your side, helping you beard/protect your brand, (for 6+ years) to be your best friend, who does want sweet nothing from you, who doesn't read too much into your melancholia, and who you play all your sad sad songs to.... 
You can't do this with someone who irritates you. It's like finding ""the one"" but in bearding, you know...

During the Speak Now era, mostly,  but also every other PR after that,  these PR relationships never worked out for her as such. It was like a hearbreak each time because it's not the guy/bestie who will help you protect the brand forever.

And I think this is why she is connecting the Lavender Haze Music video to the Speak Now era and JM. 

John Mayer ,during Speak Now, was the first PR relationship she had to cover for Martin Johnson (what a mess)
and
This relationship with Joe might be her last PR because she has found the one to share her Lavender Haze with. 

And I think it's a beautiful showcase of the fact that she can have some sort of relationship(platonic or not, doesn't matter) with the person who protects her brand with her.

And Her current Lavender Haze is her and Joe being best friends and loving and understanding each other in their own way and being able to peacefully live and share in their melancholia as best friends.

Last note: Since the start of Speak Now(maybe earlier), she masterminded the perfect plan to end up here in her Haze... thus, Joe's signs on the mastermind cover in the MV. 

(And yes, I do believe they have relationships with other people and that it's normal in Hollywood)

21135,"I never understood where the 80's inspiration appeared on the original record. Not until I saw an explanation mentioning the fact she incorporated only elements of the 80's music into the album without making it out of date and eventually, finding her own pop sound. That being said, I am a big 80's-90's music fan and that explanation never got me satisfied, although it excused the absence of prominent 80's sound.  


Now about the 1989 TV. In my opinion, the vault of 1989 serves justice to the clean and easily distinguishable sound of the 80's, Say Don't Go and Is It Over Now? being the most accurate approximation to that style.   


Another thing I've noticed is that tracks from the stolen version have become more 80's sounding. Blank Space TV has louder synths and has left behind the ""cold"" sound it had. For me, Style TV's 80's sound is best heard after the third minute with that ""flickering-scratchy"" sound. Generally the instrumentals are produced in such a way, that you could hear every instrument, sound effect or back-vocal very clearly. I used to dislike the Jack-produced tracks on the album, but oh my, they are the best they have ever sounded. I fell in love with Out Of The Woods and You Are In Love - the first I didn't get the hype about and the latter I used to skip, because the OG was boring.

30995,"So, we all know the age old “folklore is partially fictional” narrative that appeared at some point (if someone knows where this was stated pls tell me because I assume tay has said it at some point). 

I was listening to hoax today and these lyric parallels hit me like a fucking truck. Now, I really felt conflicted on posting this, because I don’t want to seem like a parasocial freak, these are just observations I made based on Tay’s current discography, and the character clues we do know. I am not saying ANY of this is true. We do not know what happened between her and Joe Alwyn, end of story. They are PEOPLE, and need to be treated as such. This is just my observation based on her current discography.

**Hoax**
“_ Don't want no other shade of blue
But you
No other sadness in the world would do_”

We hear in “paper rings” the line:
“_im with you, even if it makes me blue_” 


Which paints the imagery that she associates, in some form or fashion, blue with Joe. Other examples of this:

“_Ocean blue eyes, lookin in mine // I feel like I might sink and drown and die_”

“_dark jeans and your Nike’s, look at you// oh damn never seen that color blue_”

“_I blew things out of proportion, now you’re blue_”

“_but I’m a fire, and I’ll keep your brittle heart warm, if your cascade ocean wave blues come_”

The association of being/feeling blue, having blue eyes, all really paint images of her associating blue with Joe. Saying she doesn’t want any other shade of blue , seems like her way of saying “things may be hard right now but I’d only want to experience this with you”.

Again, callback to Paper Rings, when she says “I’m with you, even if it makes me blue”.

**Continuing the parallels**
“_ My barren land
I am ash from your fire_”

This immediately made me think of the “You’re Losing Me” line:
“_ I'm getting tired even for a phoenix
Always risin' from the ashes
Mendin' all her gashes
You might just have dealt the final blow_”

I think the connection here is pretty straightforward; the fire being issues between her and Joe, and her always having to rise above. The “fire” could be a fight, betrayal, or a major disappointment (ie no proposal.?)

Next Lyric:
**You know I left a part of me back in New York // you knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart**

I think this can be almost directly related to the Kimye/2016 public reaction to Taylor. I see it as leaving part of the person she was, prior to going into seclusion for a year. Especially with how much her and Joe are rumored to have stayed in the UK (and that we’ve heard in songs like “The Lakes”), we can draw at some point or another she reflected on the person she was in NY. 

**Final parallel that honestly fucking hurt so bad**
“_ My only one
My kingdom come undone
My broken drum
You have beaten my heart_”

**Parallel:**
“_ And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body and soul_”
 
Not only can we see the obvious comparison of him being her King (ruling her heart) if you listen to KOMH, you’ll hear a VERY intense drum line. In the live performance on Reputation Tour, the percussionists and drum section have extremely intricate and present choreography, interacting with Taylor through the entire song, and performing with a much more present force than the studio version. It’s clear in that regard, that her heart is supposed to not only mimic the drum beats, but that the drum line is given a shining solo moment. It is intended to be HEARD.

Anyways, I’m interested to hear what others think on this. I know it’s long, and probably a stupid obvious comparison that others have made, but I really needed to write it out lol.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/152qciw/hoax_may_read_into_taylors_real_life_relationship/,‘Hoax’ may read into Taylor’s real life relationship struggles more than we initially observed…,TaylorSwift,t3_152qciw,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/152qciw/hoax_may_read_into_taylors_real_life_relationship/,2023-07-18 06:24:24,Taylor Swift,0.49139655,0.26798886,"‘Hoax’ may read into Taylor’s real life relationship struggles more than we initially observed… So, we all know the age old “folklore is partially fictional” narrative that appeared at some point (if someone knows where this was stated pls tell me because I assume tay has said it at some point).

Up until I saw a post about her not charting well in France and I was confused, then I see she didn't do as well in some other countries such as Italy and Russia.

This did leave me confused. What's going on with Taylor? Why is she relatively lesser known than other artists and if the sources were reliable to measure all the artists popularity (yes, I searched in Wikipedia).

&amp;#x200B;

The only reason I'm asking this is that I like to look on cultural reactions and understanding. I've been interested in it and I want to know your answers. The charts are really nothing to determine good music but I was a bit surprised to know she's fairly more niche in other countries than some other artists. I really would like to see your theories and if it's the markets, the audience, Taylor, etc.",really well know internationally seriously impression really well know internationally saw post chart well france confus see didnt well country italy russia search artist lady gaga shakira een much high certification hae platinum chart leae confus whats go relatiely lesser know artist source reliable measure artist populty yes search wikipia ampxb reason im ask like look cultural reaction understand ie interest want know answer chart really nothing deteine good music bit surpris know shes fairly niche country artist really would like see theory market audience etc,8,"Music and Lyrics: Discussions and reflections on the emotional and personal impact of music, including how lyrics relate to relationships, identity, and cultural experiences."

Some Dua leaks have been pointed out as being from self-titled, but they sound so much like Future Nostalgia's dance-pop/pop-funk/disco vibe, I seriously doubt it.

\- **Lot To Love** was produced by Pharrell Williams, who has worked with Dua in 2019, on FN tracks (Tijuana, Cry, Sleep No More). Plus, Bad Idea also was produced by The Neptunes (which is composed by Pharrell). It says it was recorded in 2017 tho.

28469,"Hey friends! So I made a [post last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gaylor_Swift/comments/17gkk7i/my_swiftie_friend_was_talking_affectionately/) asking for the community's insights on ""boyfriend Taylor"" and speculation on whether it would be OK to let my IRL friend know I'm a Gaylor. Thank you for the encouragement! These are *trying times, but we're not dying*.

I managed to broach the subject with my friend by expressing my annoyance with the 1989 TV prologue; something about how unfair it is that Blondie built her whole brand on easter eggs, going so far as to leave clues about muses in her liner notes--yet plays the victim and acts as if we're crazy for coming to conclusions based on her art and public history.

Her face lit up, *and that was the moment I knew*. We bonded like never before over all the clues that neither of us had missed. It's a little silly how relieved I was! This is a relatively new friend, and I'd been worried about her reaction to this deep, dark secret of mine, despite her own queer tendencies / acceptance.

It's been an absolute *wonderland* of sharing insights and theories. She isn't quite as chronically online as I am, so I've had the joy of sharing some tidbits with her that she didn't know about. (bi colors ""PROUD"" bracelet (with bonus rainbow filter!) , scissors jewelry, ""...Ready For It?"" switching from ""he"" to ""you"" (there are others; we'll get there), the nuance of ""The Man"" (bitches & models), Jack Antonoff's ""oopsie,"" and more I can't even remember.

We are just living for *The Gay Of It All*. And I'd encourage you to do the same. I got lucky; my friend is also critical of Taylor's art and doesn't just worship her, taking her at face value. It's up to you to weigh whether your Swiftie friends are up for this experiment. Me, personally? I like people with open minds.

We're going to see the Eras Tour Movie again tomorrow. I'm *so* excited for the chance to react completely genuinely to it through my queer lens. It all started with *a question*: ""Do you think 'Tolerate It' might be about her dad?""

Most of all, it's just *nice to have a friend*.

Fun Facts: 

1989 and Evermore were the closest albums to having every song categorized to a season, each of them only having one song that didn’t receive enough votes to make a Top 50 (Bad Blood and long story short)

&#x200B;

There is no album without a gray area of being diverse among all seasons as a whole; however, the general consensus of albums that clearly leaned majorly into a specific season are the following: 

Fearless: Spring

Speak Now: Winter/Spring hybrid

Red: Autumn

1989: Summer

Lover: Spring/Summer hybrid

Evermore: Autumn/Winter hybrid

&#x200B;

Taylor Swift (Debut) and Reputation had too many tracks with no votes to make the call. 

Folklore and Midnights were both divided fairly evenly among all 4 seasons. 

The closest album with no gray area is Evermore, which had all songs but two categorized to only Autumn/Winter (ivy was additionally voted into Spring and long story short did not get categorized to any season). 

&#x200B;

The following list are the songs in Taylor’s discography that did not make it into the Top 50 for any season. In other words, if you really want to know the songs that truly don’t get enough love, look no further! (With one obvious exception, apparently Don’t Blame Me just doesn’t hit any seasonal vibes?!)

Which ones do you think were missed opportunities? I’ll post mine in the comments!

&#x200B;

Taylor Swift: Tim McGraw, Teardrops On My Guitar, A Place In This World, The Outside, Tied Together With A Smile, Should’ve Said No, I’m Only Me When I’m with You, Invisible, A Perfectly Good Heart

Maren Morris), We Were Happy, Don’t You, Bye Bye Baby

Speak Now: Mean, The Story of Us, Never Grow Up, Better than Revenge, Innocent, If This Was a Movie, Superman, Haunted (Acoustic Version), Mine (POP Mix)

Red (Taylor’s Version): The Lucky One, Girl At Home, Ronan, Babe, Run (feat. Ed Sheeran), The Very First Night

1989: Bad Blood

Reputation: End Game (feat. Ed Sheeran and Future), I Did Something Bad, Don’t Blame Me, Look What You Made Me Do, So It Goes…, Dancing with Our Hands Tied, Dress

Lover: The Man, Miss Americana & The Heartbreak Prince, Soon You’ll Get Better (feat. The Chicks), False God

Folklore: illicit affairs, mad woman, epiphany, peace

Evermore: long story short

Midnights (3am Edition): Question…?, Vigilante Shit, Mastermind, You’re On Your Own, Kid (Strings Remix), Sweet Nothing (Piano Remix), Glitch

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In contrast, the songs that were chosen the most often and made the Top 50 for 3 of the 4 seasons are the following: (from most to least total votes)

ivy, Begin Again, the lakes, Holy Ground, This Love

Do you agree that these songs are seasonally diverse?

Hey,
I'm sharing the video of Ana Benevides, a Taylor Swift fan who died at the artist's concert. Unfortunately, the fan's family did not receive ANY financial assistance from the company organizing the event (t4f) or from Taylor Swift's production (the family says that even Taylor’s staff or herself helped her or at least send her condolences).
The fans organized a fundraiser to help transport the body to her homeland. Terrible situation.  
Please help us spread the news and have justice for this girl!

18954,"Hello there! A thought is currently running through my head, and it gave me an idea!

So, as we all know, Taylor has meanings for almost if not all of her songs, and she hopes we can connect with her lyrics. It's one of the incredible things about her, really.

However, her songs also have the ability to have endless interpretations, depending on who is listening! 

So, what I'm getting at is this- Do you personally have a specific song/lyric(s) that you interpreted/relate to differently than Taylor does?  

For example, *You're Losing Me* is currently hitting hard because I feel a fade with a long time friend. It is written as a breakup song, but for me, I can relate it to friendship. I also relate to *marjorie* because of my kitty that passed, whereas Taylor wrote it for her grandmother.

* Jessie Ware, Róisín Murphy - Freak Me Now: 8.25
* Doja Cat - Paint The Town Red: 7.84

* Halle - Angel: 7.25

It's not great timing, but Jessie and Roisin are this week's highest, and the only track out of our main selection to pass the 8.0 mark. For Doja, Kali, Halle, and especially Tove, we didn't quite love their latest releases though there's nothing really too horrid there. It's a different story in the throwback section, where Halsey manages to get one of the highest scores of all the catch-up tracks we've done (a clear sign that we need to rate IICHLIWP asap!), while Katy completely bombs on the 10th anniversary of Roar.

###Rules Refresher

1. Rate the songs a score from 1 to 10. Please keep it to one decimal place at the most (so 7.5 is fine but 7.58 is not). Also don’t get too hung up on the final scores. This is a fun exercise and not a competition so don’t worry about over/under rating things. Just give what you think the song is to you.

2. For your review, reply to the comment that will be posted by one of us for each song. Avoid posting your reviews as a top level comment cause we probably won’t notice them if you do. Non-reviews such as questions or general commentary as upper level comments are fine.

3. Must have some sort of justification. Try to be a bit more concise than “It’s a bop!” or “I don’t like it”. Explain why! It doesn’t have to be long, two or three sentences can be plenty (though more is definitely allowed). We reserve the right not to include a review in the final total if proper justification is not given.

4. You don’t have to review each song to participate! You can do all of them or only the ones you’re familiar with.

5. The thread will be open for 6 days and close the following Wednesday at 9PM EST. The scores will be calculated and a new post will come up the next day (Thursday) at 5PM EST  with the next week’s tracks.

I want to email the store about it but I don't know what I should expect? I figure they can't exchange/replace given the low stock quantities they (apparently) have. Are they likely to refund?

952,"I enjoy K-Pop, but don't interact with it much, however, I've seen a lot of posts of the absolutely unbelievable before and after plastic surgery comparisons for other Idols, and it's always very noticeable that they have had a lot of work done, even for those who didn't change much.

That said, I've seen so many ""before and after debut"" comparisons for NewJeans and it seems that none of them have had much if any work done, because they look very, very similar. It looks like it's more just a matter of now having professional makeup artists doing their makeup rather than having had loads of plastic surgery.

Do we know of any of the NewJeans members having had plastic surgery? I haven't seen any convincing ""proof"", but I also understand that it's rarer for an idol to be natural than to have had surgery.

13088,"Before you come at me, I’ve always been both a Kaylor and Swiftgron believer and I believe there is firm evidence for both. I’d listen to Cornelia Street, Gorgeous, Dress, and many others, always thinking of Kaylor. BUT, there was always this nagging voice from hetlors stating how Karlie doesn’t make sense for certain songs in Reputation and Lover, and how Joe does. While I just couldn’t believe most of those songs were about a man, I can see how the lyrics for some of the songs didn’t match the Kaylor timeline.

I’ve heard about Tily before but I honestly didn’t bother reading the theories because I didn’t know who Lily was and she didn’t seem like a prominent part of Taylor’s life from what I’ve seen and read.  Both Karlie and Dianna were well “documented”, even as friendships, in media. But a couple of weeks ago I decided to go down the Tily rabbit hole and suddenly it all made sense. Someone put it perfectly in another post but Tily fills in all the gaps that Kaylor or Swiftgron don’t exactly make sense for.

If you didn’t know which Lily, it’s Lily Donaldson. She is a British model that was in Taylor’s life from 2016 to around 2019 I think. I really really recommend reading the master post here:

https://www.tumblr.com/tilynation

It’s hard for me to imagine that Cornelia Street is about anyone but Karlie. Non-Gaylors will say it’s about Joe, they say it can’t be about Karlie because it’s about a new person in her life. If you read the lyrics that state, ""I rent a place on Cornelia Street"" I say casually in the car” and “We were a fresh page on the desk, Filling in the blanks as we go”, it is basically talking about someone Taylor was just getting to know summer 2016 and telling them she rents a place on Cornelia Street. Karlie was not new during that time, but Lily was. If anything, this song could be about two different love interests. 

If you read the Tily master post, you’ll hopefully also see how Lily was likely an important muse and how Taylor managed to keep that relationship on the DL. If you believe Joe was a beard, he is actually the perfect beard for Lily and you’ll also see plenty of evidence of that. Ultimately, whether as a friendship or secret relationship, it seemed like Tily was done by the end of 2018 or so, and Lily seems to have moved on.

Now the secrecy is chipping away at the relationship, reminding them that they have a love that exists on the periphery, concealed from the world's view. ‘So, you leave no trace behind, like you don’t even exist’ and because of that your love doesn’t get to feel real. It think it's that frustrations of loving someone but knowing you need more. You need your presence to be felt. It’s hard when you want to feel like your relationship is real and leave signs of it happening and feel connected to the world. the performance that you have to put on in is hiding yourself, is that it feels like no one sees you at all.

6056,"Mastermind is the song in question. 

Now, I am a single, heterosexual 21-year-old male, so obviously I do not relate to Mastermind in the same way that Taylor wrote it, but it still applies to me in a lot of other ways.

Growing up, I never had friends. I always tried to fit in with the ""cool kids"" but I always tried too hard and eventually got bullied away. It came to a head when I was about 9 or 10. This other kid in my neighborhood, Sam, took a real disliking to me and one day he decided we were gonna fight, in front of all the other kids in the neighborhood. He was older and bigger than me, and I wasn't taking it seriously, so I got my ass beat in front of about fifteen other kids.

After that, I decided if I couldn't make people like me by being cool, I would make them like me by being funny. So I did, I started making jokes. Not very good ones at first, but now, ten years later, they come naturally and I can come up with a joke about pretty much anything. Everyone I work with likes having me around and I can easily build a rapport with anyone, but that all started because I couldn't make friends as a kid.

And here I am now, telling you all. On the whole, it's been a net positive. Getting beat up when I was nine or ten forged me into the comedic mastermind I am today.

Hello Swifties! 

*Can I call you guys that? Apologies if I shouldn’t, not sure how that term is landing now-a-days, considering its overuse in the media, my boomer relatives, etc., but I’ll roll with it for now.* So hi!

I could give you a Quick intro, but a scan through my Reddit profile will tell you I’m a 33 year old male who’s into sneakers, Chelsea FC, hip hop, espresso, and my Westie (Ollie). So you might be asking - why am I here? OR Can you see a pic of my dog?

And the answer to that is I’m here for some help (and yes I can provide pics of Ollie as well). 

**TL;DR / Objective:** I have (less than) 30 days to learn about all things Taylor Swift, because on Aug 7th, I’ll be attending the Eras Tour in Los Angeles...and I want to weep, I want to be swept off my feet, and I want to bask in the eternal glory that is Taylor Swift. I need you help to make me a Swiftie in Record time. **Questions are at the bottom of the page!**

Now before you roll your eyes and discount me as some sort of culture vulture, who potentially robbed a proper Swiftie (*please tell me if I’m okay using this phrase*) out of tickets, let me provide some context and background.

I’m an all-time lover of music, especially the live kind, for as long as I can remember. I’ve seen over 100 artists perform, many multiple times (I actually keep a spreadsheet of this, happy to share it out). I'm not sure anything brings me more joy (apart from my dog, obvs. And maybe my wife. Yea probably her too!). But furthermore, I am so fascinated by what I dub as legendary live experiences. I get so wrapped up in the occasion, the vibe and energy of the people there, the once in a lifetime performance. I live for those goosebumps, *even* when the artist isn’t that familiar to me!

* Jay Z at Carnegie Hall with a live orchestra
* Adele for her Vegas residency
* Kids see Ghosts (at their only live performance at Camp Flog Gnaw)
* Frank Ocean at FYF
* NIN at Webster Hall for their Downward Spiral show 

Etc.

Frank is my fav artist ever, and to see him live and sing every word along with him was a top 5 life moment for me. But to my earlier point, for the Adele show, I actually couldn’t name you 5 Adele songs, but I wept through the entire performance. She was immaculate, her voice transcended space and time, and surrounded by her diehards and experiencing their energy was equally incredible. This is what I live for!

So, when Taylor announced this run of shows, I was a bit intrigued. I signed up for the OG presale, tried to get a ticket, and like many, failed pretty hard. I’ve been keeping tabs and learning about these ALL-TIME performances has been amazing - 45 song sets, 3+ hours in the rain, new releases accompanying her sets. She is a machine. So last week, when I got a text about an additional show in LA, I thought it was a scam. I took a shot, and now I have 2 tickets for the Aug 7th LA performance. No idea how I got here, but I’m frikin STOKED. Everyone is telling me to sell and take a $3k profit, and I’m doing my best Wolf of Wallstreet impression and telling them “IM NOT GOING NO WHERE”. I’ll be at that show, surrounded by you all, and I want to be READY.

**But the one difference for this show is that I want to indulge in the experience even more. I am VERY basic when it comes to Taylor Swift, so I have 26 days to learn everything I can about her, her music, her albums.**

**Initial Questions/Help needed:**

* **If you had a time machine and could carry her entire discography back in time to when you didn't know any of her music, what would be the first album you played yourself? First song?**
   * Second to this, what would be the order of her stuff that you played yourself to fully immerse yourself in the ride?
* **Original or Taylors Version? That might be a sacrilegious question, but I get that some people might like the OG stuff. What's everyone's take on this?**
* **Favorite Taylor Lore?**

**My current Taylor experience:**

* I don’t think I could name 3 Taylor Swift songs. I’ve gone through a few and I certainly recognize the radio hits - bad blood, anti-hero, etc. but I’m a rookie. I am assuming I know a lot more, but not by name.
* Know when you are at a show and belt a song word for word along with the artist? Well I def don't have that. No songs memorized.
* I briefly know about her history in terms of the whole music right/Taylors version. Not sure if this will be helpful context for the shows
* I would say my experience with her also heavily sits with her earlier stuff, and then this last album. I’m clueless on her mid stuff (looking at Spotify, I'm talking about Lover, Evermore, Folklore, etc.)

6112,"I go to a lot of different concerts, mostly rock like deftones, slipknot, etc. but have a respect for who I think are generational artists. We’ve seen Paul McCartney, the stones, billy Joel, etc. not my cup of tea per se, but I like to see artists that have an impact on the world.  

That being said, we initially tried to buy tickets for the Saturday Vegas show when all that crap happened with TM and couldn’t secure tickets. We were bummed as I think TSwift is how I described the other aforementioned artists. 10 days ago I get a text from capital one saying we could purchase tickets so thankfully I was on my phone at the time because I’m usually not, and I was able to get 4 tickets for my better half, myself, our kid and their friend. I was so happy and excited to tell our kid we were going. 

Personally I only knew a couple of her songs before the show so I took it the playlist from Phoenix and put it on my Spotify. We listened to those songs over and over so when the concert came we all had ideas of the songs that were on and, at least I, was more familiar. 

What a show! I’ve been to hundreds of concerts and I have to say this is probably top 3, at least top 5 of my all time favs. The whole choreography and the seamless transition from eras was top notch and obviously took a lot of time and practice to make work. I really was in awe about the whole show.  

To top it off the crowd I saw and interacted was drama free, a nice change from the typical rock crowd where a lot of people are… less than pleasant. There wasn’t any pushing or shoving to get into allegiant, nobody whining that the lines for the merch places inside were too long, and just happy, positive people that wanted to have a good time and weren’t afraid to dress or dance or sing like nobody’s watching.  

That being said, I’m officially a swiftie. We bought $300 worth of merch… shirts, posters, etc. we listened to the playlist on the way home and I listened to it twice again already today.  

I would say what my favorite song is but it’s hard to say because I really do like so many. Cruel summer, lavender haze, the man, ready for it, style… the list goes on. So many good songs I didn’t know existed two weeks ago. I have some catching up to do. 

I wanted this to be a short post but I’m feeling chatty. The community here on Reddit seems pretty positive and accepting especially compared to other subreddits I post to from my main account. 

Anyway, hope y’all had as good a time as me, and for those waiting for their show, I guarantee it’s going to be a kickass time if it’s your first time seeing her like me, or your 100th time seeing her. Such a great show.  

Here’s a pic I took that’s one of my favorites.

We were bummed as I think TSwift is how I described the other aforementioned artists. 10 days ago I get a text from capital one saying we could purchase tickets so thankfully I was on my phone at the time because I’m usually not, and I was able to get 4 tickets for my better half, myself, our kid and their friend. I was so happy and excited to tell our kid we were going. 

Personally I only knew a couple of her songs before the show so I took it the playlist from Phoenix and put it on my Spotify. We listened to those songs over and over so when the concert came we all had ideas of the songs that were on and, at least I, was more familiar. 

What a show! I’ve been to hundreds of concerts and I have to say this is probably top 3, at least top 5 of my all time favs. The whole choreography and the seamless transition from eras was top notch and obviously took a lot of time and practice to make work. I really was in awe about the whole show.  

To top it off the crowd I saw and interacted was drama free, a nice change from the typical rock crowd where a lot of people are… less than pleasant. There wasn’t any pushing or shoving to get into allegiant, nobody whining that the lines for the merch places inside were too long, and just happy, positive people that wanted to have a good time and weren’t afraid to dress or dance or sing like nobody’s watching.  

That being said, I’m officially a swiftie. We bought $300 worth of merch… shirts, posters, etc. we listened to the playlist on the way home and I listened to it twice again already today.  

I would say what my favorite song is but it’s hard to say because I really do like so many. Cruel summer, lavender haze, the man, ready for it, style… the list goes on. So many good songs I didn’t know existed two weeks ago. I have some catching up to do. 

I wanted this to be a short post but I’m feeling chatty. The community here on Reddit seems pretty positive and accepting especially compared to other subreddits I post to from my main account. 

Anyway, hope y’all had as good a time as me, and for those waiting for their show, I guarantee it’s going to be a kickass time if it’s your first time seeing her like me, or your 100th time seeing her. Such a great show.  

Here’s a pic I took that’s one of my favorites.

8865,"I feel like girl at home is a sequel/answer to foolish one. I’m sure a million people have already had this same epiphany but here I am at 12:13 am making this post anyway. In foolish one she sings about pining after a guy who is happy to flirt with her and maybe get physical, but has a girlfriend he’s not going to leave for her. In the chorus she says “you are not the exception, you will never learn your lesson.” In girl at home, a song about rejecting a guy because (even if he might be charming and attractive) because he already has a partner and just wants to be a fuckboy, she says “but, honey, I am no one’s exception/this I have previously learned.”

That’s the biggest lyrical parallel but I also the think “stupid girl” feels similar to “foolish one” and the “don’t look at me, you’ve got a girl at home” line in the chorus could be a sort of call back to “I’ll get your longing glances but she’ll get your ring.” And aside from the obvious personal growth in the fact that she apparently did learn her lesson, I also really appreciate the empathy that she shows in girl at home for the other woman. In foolish one she laments how the guy will never pick her over the girlfriend he has and she sees this as a personal slight (which it is, he’s leading her own) but doesn’t really content with how it’s probably also shitty for the girl being cheated on.

Most of us here agreed that while it did have a higher percentage of dislikes than her other MV’s (7%), it’s still heavily liked and the ratio is decent for an artist like her.

But her YouTube Shorts for the song, most of which are 17-38M views as of now, are another story.

So today, I got curious again, and checked the numbers of likes and dislikes of each of her videos on YouTube. Of course the likes can be seen but I used a website from Jabrek (https://jabrek.net/dislike-en/) to check each number of dislikes. 

The dislike percentages for all of Olivia’s MV’s, behind the scenes videos, and other creative videos are all fine and minimal. But when you check out those shorts that I talked about earlier, you can see that they have dislike percentages of 25%, 27%, 29%, and 31%

I’m a person who agrees that people have a right to their own opinions. But it just baffles me that those shorts by Olivia, all of which features her lip syncing to “vampire” in all those shorts while clips of her having fun, being sweet, and showing how creative she is are shown, have THAT MUCH amount of dislikes.

I’m venting all this because I want to hear from my fellow Livies here. Are there any reasons as to why? Why does Olivia get this much hate?

So today, I got curious again, and checked the numbers of likes and dislikes of each of her videos on YouTube. Of course the likes can be seen but I used a website from Jabrek ( to check each number of dislikes. 

The dislike percentages for all of Olivia’s MV’s, behind the scenes videos, and other creative videos are all fine and minimal. But when you check out those shorts that I talked about earlier, you can see that they have dislike percentages of 25%, 27%, 29%, and 31%

I’m a person who agrees that people have a right to their own opinions. But it just baffles me that those shorts by Olivia, all of which features her lip syncing to “vampire” in all those shorts while clips of her having fun, being sweet, and showing how creative she is are shown, have THAT MUCH amount of dislikes.

I’m venting all this because I want to hear from my fellow Livies here. Are there any reasons as to why? Why does Olivia get this much hate? Again I understand that not everyone will be impressed by Olivia but I’m just shocked that those sweet and innocent promotion shorts have so much dislikes, which is really concerning.",sad concern amount dislike ampire youtube short aware post someone else concern amount dislike ampire music ideo us agre hae high percentage dislike m still heaily lik ratio decent artist like youtube short song iews another story today get curious check number like dislike ideos youtube course like see us website jabrek check number dislike dislike percentage m behind scene ideos creatie ideos fine minimal check short talk earlier see hae dislike percentage im person agrees people hae right opinion baffle short feature lip sync ampire short clip haing fun sweet show creatie show hae much amount dislike im enting want hear fellow liies reason get much hate understand eeryone impress im shock sweet innocent promotion short hae much dislike really concern,8,"Music and Lyrics: Discussions and reflections on the emotional and personal impact of music, including how lyrics relate to relationships, identity, and cultural experiences."

20112,"I was scrolling through Tik tok and saw a girl ask what evermore was about and the comments all discussed relationships/romance and I just wanted to share how much this song means to me, because it goes so much further than possibly being about romance in my interpretation. 
For me personally, this song is about depression/suicide. The song starts right away with “Hey November, I’ve been down since July..” and that immediately strikes me. Depression robs you of time and suddenly, it’s cold outside and you realize the position you’re in. Suddenly it’s December, “guess I’m feeling unmoored, can’t remember what I used to fight for.” This. This. This. Feeling hopeless. Then the bridge, “Can’t not think of all the costs. Or the things that will be lost.” At this point the song really reflects suicidal thoughts to me, you can’t help but think about everyone you’d be hurting and what would be lost, with your loss. Then, “Can we just get a pause? To be certain we’ll be tall again.” Like.. can I catch a break? Can someone just tell me everything is gonna be ok? Lastly, the lyric that strikes me the most, and that I think about every day is, “I’m on waves out being tossed, is there a line that I can just go cross?” The way I hear this is, I’m being kicked while I’m down. Is there anything I can do to just make this end? 
My dad took his life in July and it’s been a struggle since. Every time I hear “I’ve been down since July” it strikes something in me. I wish I showed him this song. He loved Style, All Too Well (10 minute version), and Soon You’ll Get Better. I just wanted to share my personal feelings/thoughts for this beautiful song that has a seriously special place in my heart.

So. In 2020, while the pandemic was in full swing, I began online classes on zoom. In Physics class, I paid my full attention to the concepts being taught and nearly always finished questions before the rest of the students, hence I would get some time to sit idle.

During said time, I had a habit of typing Taylor lyrics into the chat. You can see where this is going.

One (not) fine day during my intense Lover phase, I typed in 'We were in the back seat, drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar'

And accidently pressed enter to send it. TO MY PHYSICS TEACHER.

I didn't even realise it for a solid minute. 

When  I did, I first scrambled to see if it is possible to delete messages on zoom. Apparently it is not.

I then left the meeting, deleted my internet history, ran three circles in my room and ate two spoonfuls of Nutella before calming down and resuming class.

I had been hoping he wouldn't see the message. But later that night I saw the recorded version of that lecture. 

At one point, he just STOPPED AND STARED AT THE CHAT SCREEN WITH A DISGUSTED AND CONFUSED EXPRESSION.

He definitely saw it. I've been trying to convince myself since that day that he didn't, but right here I accept that he saw it.

I'm also hoping he's forgotten it by now. He teaches multiple classes full of two hundred students each year, there's no way he still remembers that one incident. Hopefully.

This has kind of ruined Cornelia Street for me. Now I've gotten over it, but sometimes when the song starts playing and the lyric comes on (it's the very first one), I will cringe so hard and skip the song.

My 'called my teacher mom' moment, except I sent my teacher a lyric from a super romantic and dreamy song I had hoped to one day play to my husband.

As some who has adhd I’m always on the go, my brain is working at a million miles an hour, I always have ants in my pants. I’m always plotting planning scheming to achieve my best life ever. Fomo is my middle name. My husband, the wind beneath my wings, has been said to have the patience of a saint, and has uplifted most of my craziest ideas and thankfully has been able to financially make all of my/ our dreams come true. (For context I’m a 44 year old mother of 4 kids and we met in college when we were 18 so he doesn’t know any other life than with me 💜) But this song hits home. What if I can never give him peace and I’m always on to the next? I know he often feels burned out but on the other hand most of what we accomplished as a family never would’ve been possible without my adhd hyperfocuses and persistence.

5282,"hi! So I'm reading [Odd Girls and Twilight Lovers: A History of Lesbian Life in America](https://bookshop.org/p/books/odd-girls-and-twilight-lovers-a-history-of-lesbian-life-in-twentieth-century-america-lillian-faderman/12857519) by Lilian Faderman (which is a really good read so far, and I'd recommend!), and the section on ""romantic friendship"" stood out to me -- see this excerpt for a definition of the term.

[ALT TEXT: \\""Early twentieth-century women, particularly those of the middle class, had grown up in a society where love between young females was considered the norm, \\""a rehearsal in girlhood of the great drama of woman's life,\\"" where women's love for one another was thought to \\""constitute the richness, consolation, and joy of their lives.\\"" They could still envision their relationships as romantic friendship, and if sex entered into it, they may have considered it somewhat irregular, but they did not feel compelled to spend too many daytime hours analyzing its implications.\\""](https://preview.redd.it/1csygkukukub1.jpg?width=2468&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0a077f02f53f5c2edac559e693a5da5e519c2741)

There's something about the idea of sort of play-acting intense romance with other women as ""practice"" for ""real"" relationships with men that feels especially reminiscent of ""right where you left me:""

[ALT TEXT: \\""Did you ever hear about the girl who got frozen? \/ Time went on for everybody else, she won't know it \/ She's still twenty-three inside her fantasy \/ How it was supposed to be \/ Did you hear about the girl who lives in delusion? \/ Breakups happen every day, you don't have to lose it \/ She's still twenty-three inside her fantasy \/ And you're sitting in front of me \/ At the restaurant \/ when I was still the one you want \/ Cross-legged in the dim light \/ Everything was just right, I \/ I could feel the mascara run \/ You told me that you met someone \/ Glass shattered on the white cloth \/ Everybody moved on.\\""](https://preview.redd.it/3s4035d4wkub1.png?width=980&format=png&auto=webp&s=594838e14e9821440dc66423a2a4ea1f08483d36)

Some more context for what would have traditionally comprised a ""romantic friendship:""

[ALT TEXT: \\""Perhaps the most important element in encouraging young college women in their escape from domesticity was a new form of what had been termed romantic friendship, which came to be called in college life \\""smashes,\\"" \\""crushes,\\"" and \\""spoons.\\"" These passions were even described in an 1873 Yale student newspaper, obviously without any awareness that relationships of that nature might have sexual undertones, or that some elements of them were already being seen as \\""inversion\\"" by some European sexologists: \\""When a Vassar girl takes a shine to another,\\"" the Yalie observed, \\""she straightaway enters upon a regular course of bouquet sendings, interspersed with tinted notes, mysterious packages of 'Ridley's Mixed Candies,' locks of hair perhaps, and many other tender tokens, until at last the object of her attentions is captured, the two women become inseparable, and the aggressor is considered by her circle of acquaintances as -- smashed.\\""](https://preview.redd.it/4awtkw6lwkub1.jpg?width=3010&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e232343d8abcf99c4db60f1d1b326c386f93934e)

To me this really evokes the vibes of early kaylor. See these quotes from their [Vogue ""Best Friends"" article](https://www.vogue.com/article/taylor-swift-karlie-kloss-best-friends-march-2015-cover):

[ALT TEXT: \\""Swift is describing her philosophy about making friends--basically, wear 'em down till they like you-- when Kloss sweeps into the apartment, a six-foot-one beam of sunshine. Though Swift and Kloss have known each other for only a year, their best-friendship, they tell me, was instantaneous.\\""](https://preview.redd.it/go7dwvipzkub1.png?width=1370&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca5ba63e5814f7ec735f0058c3674e0f6b1fafbb)

[ALT TEXT: \\""A mutual friend, Kloss's fellow VS model Lily Aldridge, introduced her to Swift, 'and we were just like, You. My friend. Now,' says Swift. A few months later, they saw each other again at an Oscars after-party, and Kloss suggested they do something spontaneous. \\""I'd been to Big Sur once before, and I was like, 'We should just do it,' says Swift.](https://preview.redd.it/7ix8g3b50lub1.png?width=1282&format=png&auto=webp&s=9dc6605ab07996c0049a4998a4f632df8186e2c3)

With that context established, here's the piece of that chapter that made me run over here to make a post about it lol!

[ALT TEXT: \\""'Poets and Lovers Evermore:' In a poem of the 1890s two Englishwomen, Katharine Bradley and Edith Cooper, \\""romantic friends\\"" who wrote twenty-five plays and eight books of poetry together under the pseudonym Michael Field, declared of themselves: \\""My love and I took hands and swore \/ Against the world to be \/ Poets and lovers evermore.\\"" Many early professional women in America also clasped hands and swore, generally not to be poets together, but often to be doctors, professors, ministers, union organizers, social workers, or pacifist lectures together--and \\""lovers evermore.\\""](https://preview.redd.it/di38rx051lub1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=04504720e12d53c4dc6cf8d9640dc60bc48a491e)

Given that declaring yourselves to be ""lovers evermore"" was a somewhat common phrase for romantic friends to use, it struck me that that terminology also, famously, comes up not infrequently in Taylor's discography. The usage in ""New Year's Day"" seems to most match the kind of promise language used by romantic friends: 

[ALT TEXT: \\""There's glitter on the floor after the party \/ Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby \/ Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor \/ You and me forevermore.\\""](https://preview.redd.it/jdcjwitw1lub1.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0ad69452f7a97a106893f749fb305127665ed52)

There's also the ""evermore"" references in ""Welcome to New York"" (""I could dance to this beat forevermore"") and ""Long Story Short"" (""And my waves meet your shore ever and evermore""). And then the fact that, obviously, she names an entire album and song ""evermore."" Which also strikes me as interesting, given that the song ""evermore"" is about the process of being so certain that pain will stick with you forever, and then slowly realizing that it will not in fact be a forever pain. Which feels especially striking if you're reading ""folklore"" and ""evermore"" as a two album project to attempt to recover from a sapphic situationship (which I do) (and also which this tweet that I can never get out of my head agrees with lol):

[ALT TEXT: A tweet from Twitter user getsthebride that says \\""this is what a lesbian situationship does to a person\\"" with a photo of Taylor Swift with a haunted look in her eye during the \\""illicit affairs\\"" portion of the Eras tour folklore set.](https://preview.redd.it/948pjxom3lub1.png?width=808&format=png&auto=webp&s=76a62cc797534c7315de94fda9bffe1ef4f51450)

Like, it's the the idea of ""evermore"" as the completion of the project started in ""folklore."" ""Folklore"" as a term referencing the fact that the relationship(s) that inspired these feelings can't be considered fully *real.* Hence ""my mind turns your life into folklore / I can't dare to dream about you anymore."" You're constructing a story narrative to allow the feelings you experienced to have a structure in which you can feel them. But you can only play around in the folklore of the relationship for so long before you're forced to contend with the fact that, while the stories you told about the relationship weren't necessarily allowed to be real, the pain and feeling that came along with that relationship and its stories are incredibly long-lasting. Hence why ""folklore,"" I think, necessarily needs to be followed by ""evermore."" The feeling that this pain will be ""evermore"" is ""peculiar"" because it wasn't *supposed* to be real. It was just supposed to be folklore. It was just supposed to be a story about a girl. But, after filling two albums about this relationship, attempting to give the relationship emotional legitimacy by declaring that, even if it was *only* a ""romantic friendship,"" it was still romantic enough to make all this art about --  and attempting at the same time to process and heal from the relationship -- it's impossible to deny that the promises made in the relationship *were* real. It was supposed to be something that lasted ""forevermore,"" and the fact that it was not allowed to then creates a pain that lasts forevermore in its place. It's only through the project of meaning-making that is folkmore that the pain is maybe finally allowed to rest. It's only by recognizing that the promises of ""forever"" were real that the subject of the albums is able to move forward with their life. 

It just feels really compelling to think about like, the language of a pseudo-relationship between women a hundred years ago being echoed in the pseudo-relationships of women in the modern day. It's the need to couch feelings in a framework that, while internally allowing for the women involved in the relationship to feel an immensity of emotion, devotion, and love for each other, must to external society be played off as something childish that will be cast aside when more appropriate attachments to men come along later. Like, I don't necessarily think that Taylor was aware of this history and or necessarily purposefully writing it into her discography (though I also don't think it's out of the question!), but tbh I think it's equally moving in either way: there's something so poignant about a a conscious invocation of this period of queer history, and also something so poignant about an unintentional returning to the same phrases for the same feelings a century apart!

[ALT TEXT: \\""Early twentieth-century women, particularly those of the middle class, had grown up in a society where love between young females was considered the norm, \\""a rehearsal in girlhood of the great drama of woman's life,\\"" where women's love for one another was thought to \\""constitute the richness, consolation, and joy of their lives.\\"" They could still envision their relationships as romantic friendship, and if sex entered into it, they may have considered it somewhat irregular, but they did not feel compelled to spend too many daytime hours analyzing its implications.\\""](

There's something about the idea of sort of play-acting intense romance with other women as ""practice"" for ""real"" relationships with men that feels especially reminiscent of ""right where you left me:""

[ALT TEXT: \\""Did you ever hear about the girl who got frozen? \/ Time went on for everybody else, she won't know it \/ She's still twenty-three inside her fantasy \/ How it was supposed to be \/ Did you hear about the girl who lives in delusion? \/ Breakups happen every day, you don't have to lose it \/ She's still twenty-three inside her fantasy \/ And you're sitting in front of me \/ At the restaurant \/ when I was still the one you want \/ Cross-legged in the dim light \/ Everything was just right, I \/ I could feel the mascara run \/ You told me that you met someone \/ Glass shattered on the white cloth \/ Everybody moved on.\\""](

Some more context for what would have traditionally comprised a ""romantic friendship:""

[ALT TEXT: \\""Perhaps the most important element in encouraging young college women in their escape from domesticity was a new form of what had been termed romantic friendship, which came to be called in college life \\""smashes,\\"" \\""crushes,\\"" and \\""spoons.\\"" These passions were even described in an 1873 Yale student newspaper, obviously without any awareness that relationships of that nature might have sexual undertones, or that some elements of them were already being seen as \\""inversion\\"" by some European sexologists: \\""When a Vassar girl takes a shine to another,\\"" the Yalie observed, \\""she straightaway enters upon a regular course of bouquet sendings, interspersed with tinted notes, mysterious packages of 'Ridley's Mixed Candies,' locks of hair perhaps, and many other tender tokens, until at last the object of her attentions is captured, the two women become inseparable, and the aggressor is considered by her circle of acquaintances as -- smashed.\\""](

To me this really evokes the vibes of early kaylor. See these quotes from their [Vogue ""Best Friends"" article](

[ALT TEXT: \\""Swift is describing her philosophy about making friends--basically, wear 'em down till they like you-- when Kloss sweeps into the apartment, a six-foot-one beam of sunshine. Though Swift and Kloss have known each other for only a year, their best-friendship, they tell me, was instantaneous.\\""](

[ALT TEXT: \\""A mutual friend, Kloss's fellow VS model Lily Aldridge, introduced her to Swift, 'and we were just like, You. My friend. Now,' says Swift. A few months later, they saw each other again at an Oscars after-party, and Kloss suggested they do something spontaneous. \\""I'd been to Big Sur once before, and I was like, 'We should just do it,' says Swift.](

With that context established, here's the piece of that chapter that made me run over here to make a post about it lol!

[ALT TEXT: \\""'Poets and Lovers Evermore:' In a poem of the 1890s two Englishwomen, Katharine Bradley and Edith Cooper, \\""romantic friends\\"" who wrote twenty-five plays and eight books of poetry together under the pseudonym Michael Field, declared of themselves: \\""My love and I took hands and swore \/ Against the world to be \/ Poets and lovers evermore.\\"" Many early professional women in America also clasped hands and swore, generally not to be poets together, but often to be doctors, professors, ministers, union organizers, social workers, or pacifist lectures together--and \\""lovers evermore.\\""](

Given that declaring yourselves to be ""lovers evermore"" was a somewhat common phrase for romantic friends to use, it struck me that that terminology also, famously, comes up not infrequently in Taylor's discography. The usage in ""New Year's Day"" seems to most match the kind of promise language used by romantic friends: 

[ALT TEXT: \\""There's glitter on the floor after the party \/ Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby \/ Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor \/ You and me forevermore.\\""](

There's also the ""evermore"" references in ""Welcome to New York"" (""I could dance to this beat forevermore"") and ""Long Story Short"" (""And my waves meet your shore ever and evermore""). And then the fact that, obviously, she names an entire album and song ""evermore."" Which also strikes me as interesting, given that the song ""evermore"" is about the process of being so certain that pain will stick with you forever, and then slowly realizing that it will not in fact be a forever pain. Which feels especially striking if you're reading ""folklore"" and ""evermore"" as a two album project to attempt to recover from a sapphic situationship (which I do) (and also which this tweet that I can never get out of my head agrees with lol):

[ALT TEXT: A tweet from Twitter user getsthebride that says \\""this is what a lesbian situationship does to a person\\"" with a photo of Taylor Swift with a haunted look in her eye during the \\""illicit affairs\\"" portion of the Eras tour folklore set.](

Like, it's the the idea of ""evermore"" as the completion of the project started in ""folklore."" ""Folklore"" as a term referencing the fact that the relationship(s) that inspired these feelings can't be considered fully *real.* Hence ""my mind turns your life into folklore / I can't dare to dream about you anymore."" You're constructing a story narrative to allow the feelings you experienced to have a structure in which you can feel them. But you can only play around in the folklore of the relationship for so long before you're forced to contend with the fact that, while the stories you told about the relationship weren't necessarily allowed to be real, the pain and feeling that came along with that relationship and its stories are incredibly long-lasting. Hence why ""folklore,"" I think, necessarily needs to be followed by ""evermore."" The feeling that this pain will be ""evermore"" is ""peculiar"" because it wasn't *supposed* to be real. It was just supposed to be folklore. It was just supposed to be a story about a girl. But, after filling two albums about this relationship, attempting to give the relationship emotional legitimacy by declaring that, even if it was *only* a ""romantic friendship,"" it was still romantic enough to make all this art about --  and attempting at the same time to process and heal from the relationship -- it's impossible to deny that the promises made in the relationship *were* real. It was supposed to be something that lasted ""forevermore,"" and the fact that it was not allowed to then creates a pain that lasts forevermore in its place. It's only through the project of meaning-making that is folkmore that the pain is maybe finally allowed to rest. It's only by recognizing that the promises of ""forever"" were real that the subject of the albums is able to move forward with their life. 

It just feels really compelling to think about like, the language of a pseudo-relationship between women a hundred years ago being echoed in the pseudo-relationships of women in the modern day. It's the need to couch feelings in a framework that, while internally allowing for the women involved in the relationship to feel an immensity of emotion, devotion, and love for each other, must to external society be played off as something childish that will be cast aside when more appropriate attachments to men come along later. Like, I don't necessarily think that Taylor was aware of this history and or necessarily purposefully writing it into her discography (though I also don't think it's out of the question!), but tbh I think it's equally moving in either way: there's something so poignant about a a conscious invocation of this period of queer history, and also something so poignant about an unintentional returning to the same phrases for the same feelings a century apart!

34254,"Following Miley Cryus’ divorce from Liam Hemsworth, her partner of 10 years, the pop star linked her personal and professional life together. On *Plastic Hearts*, Cyrus found comfort in pinning her frank confessions against a gritty backdrop of rough rock. On *Flowers*, the lead single for her upcoming album, Miley is still reflecting on the fallout of their break up, but she has shifted soundscapes. “Yeah, I can love me better than you can,” Cyrus sings, hinting that she’s in a peaceful state, but the vacuous, glossy dance beat dampens any notes of real gratification. 

The chorus of *Flowers* bears a striking resemblance to Bruno Mars’ *When I Was Your Man*, both lyrically and melodically. Neither of these songs caters to their performer's readily flexible voices, but *Flowers*, in particular, is flat. “Talk to myself for hours (Yeah)/Say things you don't understand,” croons Cyrus on the hook. The decision to swap her usual bombastic voice for a sheepish accent is an odd one, especially considering just how much of the song Cyrus dedicates to celebrating self-love and being autonomous.

In the past, Cyrus has, with mixed effect, wholeheartedly pivoted between genres. On *Flowers* though, the funk elements are light and soporific. You’ve heard Cyrus own the dance floor before, but this is no sharp, synth-infused experiment like the watt-produced *Midnight Sky* or the romping Mark Ronson-assisted *Nothing Breaks Like a Heart*.

7992,"So I've seen people compare songs based on track number which can be fun but they can also be random. Back when I played tennis in high school, our matchups were determined based on our skill level, e.g. our best player played their best player, 2nd vs. 2nd, and so on. 

So I thought it would be fun to apply that methodology to her songs. For folklore and evermore, the most-streamed song on each album (according to Spotify) would be matched up, #2 vs. #2, etc.

Here are the matchups:

folklore vs. evermore

32935,"Since the last two re-recordings were announced during her Eras concerts, it’s not unlikely that she will do the same the same with Reputation TV and Debut TV.  

*Speak Now TV* was announced on her May 5 show in Nashville and was released two months later on July 7. *1989 TV* was announced at her final US show in Los Angeles on August 9 and released almost three months later on October 27.  

Going by these patterns and looking at her [international tour dates,](https://www.taylorswift.com/tour/) I’m gonna make some baseless predictions for the next two re-recordings.  

I think she will announce Reputation TV on the final show of the South American leg of her tour at the third São Paulo, Brazil show on Sunday **November 26** for a release in **February 2024**, probably around the start of the Asian/Pacific leg of her tour.  

Debut TV I’m less sure of, but going by the schedule I think it would be cool if she announced during the final Wembley Stadium show in London on **August 17, 2024**, the last show of the European leg. Release date could be in **November 2024** to coincide with the final Canadian leg of the tour.

Last night, Taylor Nation directed us to this very specific playlist on Spotify. It’s called ‘snow globe’ and it starts with Lover and ends with New Year’s Day. (It also includes TTDS, SOTBFMLDR, Back to December, Safe & Sound, Anti-Hero (feat. Bleachers) in that order between Lover and NYD.) 

The nod to the playlist was because the “story” for the playlist had one of the pieces to the billboard announcing Taylor as the Spotify Global Top Artist. So maybe it ends there. 

Or maybe it doesn’t. 

The playlist is exactly 4 hours and 37 minutes long. Which would be insignificant if not for the fact that You’re Losing Me (From the Vault) is exactly 4 minutes and 37 seconds long. 

Coincidentally, Taylor released YLM today, November 29th, on streaming, celebrating the same thing Taylor Nation was pointing to on the ‘snow globe’ playlist. 

They’re connected. 

Of course, 4/37 isn’t a date, but if we look at 4:37 as a measure of time, 4 months, 3 weeks, and 7 days would put us at *checks notes* the anniversary of ME! being dropped as a single from Lover, April 26th, or Lesbian Visibility Day.(Disclaimer: I do not believe she is a lesbian, I think she’s bi, but this is an important date for the lore.) 

And if you connect New Year’s Day with the Lover era, you know Taylor Nation counted down from New Year’s Day in 2019 with 115 rainbow emojis that were pointing to 4/26. NYD was specifically linked to ME! and the Lover era in that way.

18614,"This is my attempted,  (albeit ultra long and maybe late) take on the Taylor and Joe relationship and falling out. I mean no offense to any of them; this is just my way of understanding both sides of it and why a relationship that seemed so ultimate, (at least from Taylors perspective), changed so drastically.

Taylor and Joe fall in love: Taylor is an ENFJ, at her most extraverted point, having just been at the height of pop stardom. Joe is an ISTJ, introverted and private, which appeals to Taylor because that is opposite of her but also because after being hated by the whole world privacy and pulling back from the public is what she wants.

Their personalities click for distinct reasons. ISTJ joe is a sensor, thinker, feeler, and intuitive. As an ENFJ, Taylor is a feeler, intuitive, sensor, and thinker. So while they have different dominant functions their differences are manageable. Taylor is down to earth enough for Joe's sensing preference and Joe is emotional enough for Taylor's feeling preference. And because they are both Js they enjoy the similarities between Fe and Te and Si and Ni, which run side by side, albeit on different tracks. So they understand each other as well as complement each other's strengths and weaknesses.

Taylor and Joe have a six year long relationship:
So. They settle into their relationship. During this time, Taylor becomes more private than she ever was, as well as more bookish and serious. When the pandemic hits she puts out two studio albums that are alot more subdued and intellectual than any of her previous work both lyrically and musically. She focuses on characters instead of her personal life, once again pulling away from the spotlight and behaving more reserved. 

What I'm saying is, is that during her relationship with Joe, Taylor (who I believe is an ambivert) walked over the line from extraversion to introversion. Ironically because of him, but to both their detriments. 

INFJs have the same function stack as ENFJs but in a different order. INFJs are intuitive, feelers, thinkers, and  sensors. Lining that up with Joe, Taylor's strength, intuition, is Joe's greatest weaknesses. He's bad at it and also dislikes it. The same goes for Taylor's sensing function. In lavender haze she says ""I just wanna stay in that lavender haze"" She does not want to be practical and settle down. She needs intuitive feeling stuff, the kind of glamour she had before closing off from the public. She wants to go back on tour and ""reclaim the land""  ""make the whole place shimmer"" again. 

Joe doesn't understand this. ""You say I don't understand and I say I know you don't"". As a down to earth and logical person, he doesn't understand why she feels like she's dying without a fantastical, emotional world to exist in. 

And she's ""fadin thinking do something babe...I got nothing to believe"" unless he's choosing her, unless he sees her inner world and what she needs to feel alive. 

Midnight rain is one of the most telling proofs of all this; ""he wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain. He wanted a bride I was making my own name, chasing that fame he stayed the same. ALL OF ME CHANGED LIKE MIDNIGHT RAIN""

INFJs are alot more complicated than ENFJs. They are more likely to struggle with depression and the physical world in general. You can see how Taylor now veers to the INFJ side of her  from the way she performs, writes, and behaves now compared to how she did throughout most of her career. Her expressions  are more intense and brooding, and she's definitely giving many INFJ stares with those ""storms in her eyes"" lmao. Her writing on midnights is more logical and perception oriented, relatively speaking. 
Her movements are more preplanned and contained.

So is Joe the one for Taylor or not? I wouldn't want to say that a relationship is dependent on an ambivert swinging from introversion to extraversion and back.Though perhaps Taylors ideal state is to lean towards ENFJ, as a performer and entertainer. And maybe if Taylor continues to emerge from her INFJ shell as The Eras tour ensues, she'll soon be back to a place where they are adequate for each other.

24898,"It’s disappointing for sure how fans who believe queer interpretations of ts lyrics have been very much strung along and baited. An example I can think of off the top of my head is how she said “I salute you” and did the lesbian salute before performing Hits Different at the eras tour. That’s really f’ing weird to do as an ally. She wasn’t saluting before any other songs - just the one with a line that’s about a girl. So now that Taylor has once again “come out” as an ally… it causes us to look back on moments like this one, and wonder what the motivation is. Late stage capitalist queen?

So now that Taylor has once again “come out” as an ally… it causes us to look back on moments like this one, and wonder what the motivation is. Late stage capitalist queen?

Has anybody had any issue with her? She's known for making the Lover snow globe knock off. I bought one in Dec 2022.

It's now summer time, 7 months later, and she still has not sent a replacement. She still has my money.

Has anyone had a similar issue, or advice on what to do?""

32681,"I'm just curious - for which songs (for which there are currently Taylor's Versions) do you stick, or will you be sticking, to the original versions rather than the TVs?

I try to stick to listening to the TV of the songs for which there are TVs so far as much as I can, but for certain songs, I just prefer the original version over the TV a LOT, so I still listen to it (in the case of Fearless TV, Speak Now TV & Red TV)/predict that I'll still be listening to it (in the case of 1989 TV).

I'm currently updating the Spotify playlists that I've made for myself for each album (I have a playlist for each album's era that also includes songs that aren't on the standard or deluxe editions of the album, which means that I can't listen to all the songs from an era just by pulling up a single album on Spotify) and am finding myself making two versions for 3 of the 4 albums so far - one version that's a purely Taylor's Version-only playlist, and for certain albums, a ""perfect"" version that's mostly Taylor's Versions but with one or two original versions substituted in because I love the originals too much to switch over.

So far, this is what my ""perfect"" versions are for each of the albums for which there are TVs:

Fearless: I just have a single playlist that's purely TVs, because I don't actually miss the old versions and prefer the TVs.

Speak Now: There's only one original version, which is Enchanted. Her voice just sounds too different on the new one - her mature vocals are beautiful on most of the re-records, but Enchanted needs her younger voice, even with its imperfections, imo.

Red: There's only one original version, which is WANEGBT. The ""we""s still sound weird to me, no matter how many times I've listened to the TV. I find most of the TVs from Red great, although I haven't listened to 22 TV and IKYWT TV enough to decide whether I prefer the originals, and for a lot of people, it seems to be the pop songs on Red TV that have the most noticeable differences compared to the original versions.

1989: It's too soon to say, but so far I've included one original version, which is Style. Style TV just sounds too bland and flat to me, and the original is probably my favourite song on the album, so I'll be sticking with the original. I need to listen to 1989 TV a few more times to get a sense of which songs I'll be sticking with the original versions of, but so far Style TV is the only one that I just can't switch to.

16973,"I see this posted a lot in Gaylor spaces. Joe Alwyn is a terrible actor and no matter how much Taylor tried, she just couldn't get his career off the ground, thus not fulfilling her bearding contract leading to Grammygate.

However, I just watched Harriet last night, (the Harriet Tubman biopic.) This is the first time I have ever seen Joe Alwyn in anything and honestly, he was fantastic. I was so immersed in the story, I couldn't even see him as Joe Alwyn anymore, his character was truly a monster and I hated him in it. To me, that's a mark of a good actor. When they make you forget that you're watching a story. I am curious to watch other performances of his now.

So, where does this idea that he is so terrible come from?  Is this just the gaylor version of hating her exes in the way the hets do? But taking it out on beards instead?  It's odd to me.

I also see this theme when discussing WB and Betty. Now, I don't necessarily believe Joe is WB, I think it's likely he isn't for other reasons. But to imply he is an untalented or an unskilled writer? I mean, the man has a bachelors degree in English literature! I think it's entirely possible he could have written some lyrics in the past, but only if he and TS were real and  I don't necessarily buy that even though I am a bilor truther.

Thoughts??

31352,"I lost my grandma on Christmas day when I was 11 in 2005. I was never able to fully express my sadness due to being really young and not fully understanding what was going on. It was a really traumatic experience for my whole family, my mom suffered from severe depression after it happened so I felt I had to be the ""grown up"" and help out with what she needed. Christmas after that was never the same, i was only able to enjoy the season after i moved away from home. 

When Taylor released Evermore and i listed to Marjorie the first time I cried like a baby. It was like i finally understood what happened and what i missed by not having a grandma growing up ""I should have asked you questions, i should have asked you how to be"". It killed me.

I just want to say that Taylor helped me process my grief through this song almost 15 years later when the album came out. I'm 29 now and I'm going to her concert in November, I know this specific song will destroy me and i'm going to ugly cry for 4 minutes and 17 seconds. 

I guess my question to you all is. What Taylor song made you process feelings that you wouldn't have otherwise, or at least made you think about it?

**In case it is the last time**

33188,"So when music sharing was really big online in the late 2000s, I traded a lot of music with people online who had Stevie Nicks rarities, b-sides, and outtakes. From my understanding, a lot of these came from compilations that were converted from audio cassettes throughout the 80s-90s that Stevie herself shared and/or were leaked from people who worked in studio. These also often included random live tracks.

Stevie has been open about this topic and often commented that she had so many songs, and obviously not all of them would make album cuts, so she didn’t really mind them circulating. Eventually around 2014 she released an album called “From the Vault” and professionally re-recorded a lot of these songs that were circulating that reached cult level.

With the official release of “You’re Losing Me”, it kind of clicked with me that Taylor uses streaming services to do something similar and make all her rarities more accessible to fans. 

So my question is: does anybody ever make playlists of songs / versions of songs that are outside of the “standard 10” albums?

1448,"(Included are the Synastry Chart with Taylor Swift's Birth Time recorded as 5:17am, as well as the Composite Chart. If you want, I can also share the many, many posts where I've talked about why the 5:17 birth time is accurate in my opinion, as I'm currently studying Chart Rectification in order to prepare for the NCGR exam, and I needed someone to practice on anyway.)

I'm gonna do this in a bullet point format, as it's just easier for me right now (tldr, I'm going through some mental health struggles right now, no big deal but it's still like a Thing). 

TS and KK initially seemed like they were a match on every level. There's a Trine between KK's Venus and TS's Sun, suggesting that once they met one another in a safe-ish set of circumstances, the attraction they felt was both immediate and powerful. TS's Moon is also technically forming a Sign Conjunction to KK's Ascendant, indicating that both of them felt understood on a deep emotional level. 

The problem is, their experience wasn't a mutual thing, even though both of them wanted it to be. Karlie likely felt far more destabilized by the relationship than Taylor did, for a variety of reasons. It's highly suggested that the people who supported KK outright HATED TS (KK's Sun Square TS's Pluto, with the Sun being KK's 2H Ruler and Pluto being TS's Modern Chart Ruler). There's also an Astrological School that claims that the Sun is also one of the Rulers of Cancer, which would make the Sun in Leo KK's secondary Chart Ruler (if you want an explanation of this I can provide one). This indicates that on some level, KK felt like she had to prioritize her career over her relationship with TS. 

Which gets to the heart of the problem: KK and TS both have their Moons in the 12H. KK's Moon is in TS's Whole Signs 12H, whereas TS's Moon is in KK's Placidus 12H Conjunct Jupiter. Their Moons are also Squaring one another, and the degrees are within orb according to the standards set by acclaimed Mundane Astrologer William Lilly, who kind of established a tradition of Mundane Astrology which I currently practice. 

Having the Moon in your partner's 12th House isn't incredibly uncommon in lesbian relationships, and while having a double-whammy 12H occupation is less common, you do see it. The problem here is the Square. KK likely felt like her desires for privacy weren't being respected by TS, and TS likely felt like KK was ashamed of her. Unfortunately, there's an indication that neither of them were wrong. Both of them were quite immature, and TS's Saturn being on KK's Descendant AND Squaring KK's Moon likely didn't help matters. There was a sense that both of them had to grow up faster than they wanted to, and neither of them knew how. 

TS almost definitely had more power in this situation than KK did, even if neither of them saw that at the time. There's a lot more essential dignity within TS's Chart than there is within KK's Chart. KK has a Combust Venus and Mercury, her Moon is edging way too freaking close to Via Combusta (the space between 15 Libra and 15 Scorpio, has a lot of Fixed Stars, generally thought to be enormously difficult for any Planet but especially for the Moon), and her Jupiter is Exiled, whereas TS's Jupiter is Exalted Conjunct her Moon in Domicile. Essentially, this means that TS doesn't rely on others the way KK feels she has to. 

Thus, the death knell of their relationship. KK absolutely gave Scooter Braun information about TS. It was likely coerced information given the time frame and the role that Scooter Braun likely plays in KK's life, but it was still a decision that KK made knowing it would hurt TS. The worst part of it is that TS almost definitely had the power to help KK had KK just asked her for help. 

And the thing with 12H Synastry is, KK and TS were definitely soulmates, but not of the kind TS thought. KK was not TS's Twin Flame, by any stretch of the imagination. There's a kind of soulmate that many Esotericists call a Karmic soulmate, which is an intense soulmate that ultimately you're supposed to pay off your debts to and eventually separate from. She even says this in ""it's time to go"": ""When the words of a sister come back in whispers that prove she was not/ in fact what she seemed, not a twin from your dreams, she's a crook who was caught."" There's other indications, like ""hoax"" (""You know the hero died so what's the movie for?/ You know it still hurts underneath my scars from where they pulled me apart ... But what you did was just as dark"") that indicate that this relationship ended as many mutual 12H relationships end, especially before the first Saturn Return (usually happens between ages 28-30): they betrayed one another. 

KK betrayed TS by helping Scooter Braun and Scott Borchetta steal TS's Masters. TS, seeing this, likely got a few last swipes in by writing songs about their relationship, many of which were outright mean at times. Having TS's Scorpio Mars be her Traditional Chart Ruler likely indicates that TS doesn't act until she's pushed past the point of no return, but once she is, usually by extremely personal betrayals, she will use every underhanded trick in the book, and she's rather likely to win. 

""Closure"", in particular, was likely meticulously designed to hurt KK, and it did (more on this later, if you see the Synastry Chart between KK and evermore you can see that evermore really really hurt KK). And sure, TS was likely in the right to do what she did - she toed the line of that NDA that she was likely forced to sign after her relationship with KK ended, so none of us actually know who those songs are about - but some of them were brutal. The fact that brutality comes easily to TS in the face of betrayal doesn't help. TS has a Placidus 8H Moon in this Chart, indicating that she has a strong tendency to be betrayed by people she trusts, and that she eventually learns how to defend herself from that kind of betrayal in the future. 

And unfortunately, the parting was likely irreconcilable, for a variety of reasons. TS likely is not willing to budge from her position. Problem is, it was almost definitely a mistake on KK's part. TS acted in her own best interest, and while she did underhanded things, she was likely justified to do so; KK has to live with the fact that she will never live down what she did to TS, that in fact a large number of people hate KK despite having never met her. 

KK chose fame over love, and in the end, she realized that fame doesn't keep you warm at night. She will likely always mourn her relationship with TS, in a way TS just won't.

At the end of the day, TS likely moved on - yes, with her tears and her beers and her candles, but still, she moved on. She didn't need KK's closure. She had strength that KK just didn't have, and probably still doesn't, really. 

KK likely showed up at the last Eras Tour concert for one specific purpose: to tell TS that she's still in love and that she hasn't moved on. Despite rumors to the contrary, TS didn't even give KK the chance to say it to her face: as far as I know, KK wasn't invited into the VIP tent with the rest of TS's friends. TS didn't want KK's closure, even now, more than ten years after they likely broke up - and that, in my educated opinion, speaks volumes.",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/15zk7qa,Gaylor Astrology Post 1: Taylor Swift + Karlie Kloss,Gaylor_Swift,t3_15zk7qa,/r/Gaylor_Swift/comments/15zk7qa/gaylor_astrology_post_1_taylor_swift_karlie_kloss/,2023-08-23 23:14:16,Taylor Swift,0.07212844,0.027247453,"Gaylor Astrology Post 1: Taylor Swift + Karlie Kloss (Included are the Synastry Chart with Taylor Swift's Birth Time recorded as 5:17am, as well as the Composite Chart.

KK chose fame over love, and in the end, she realized that fame doesn't keep you warm at night. She will likely always mourn her relationship with TS, in a way TS just won't.

At the end of the day, TS likely moved on - yes, with her tears and her beers and her candles, but still, she moved on. She didn't need KK's closure. She had strength that KK just didn't have, and probably still doesn't, really. 

KK likely showed up at the last Eras Tour concert for one specific purpose: to tell TS that she's still in love and that she hasn't moved on. Despite rumors to the contrary, TS didn't even give KK the chance to say it to her face: as far as I know, KK wasn't invited into the VIP tent with the rest of TS's friends. TS didn't want KK's closure, even now, more than ten years after they likely broke up - and that, in my educated opinion, speaks volumes.",gaylor astrology post karlie kloss includ synastry chart birth time record well composite chart want also share many many post ie talk birth time accurate opinion im currently study chart rectification order prepare ncgr exam ne someone practice anyway im gonna bullet point foat easy right tldr im go mental health struggle right big deal still like thing t kk initially seem like match eery leel there trine kks enus tss sun suggest met one another safeish set circumstance attraction felt immiate powerful tss moon also technically foing sign conjunction kks ascendant indicate felt understood deep emotional leel problem experience wasnt mutual thing een though want karlie likely felt far destabiliz relationship ety reason highly suggest people support kk outright hat t kks sun square tss pluto sun kks h ruler pluto tss modern chart ruler there also astrological school claim sun also one ruler cancer would make sun leo kks secondary chart ruler want explanation proide one indicates leel kk felt like prioritize career oer relationship t get heart problem kk t hae moon h kks moon tss whole sign h whereas tss moon kks placidus h conjunct jupiter moon also squng one another degree within orb accord standard set acclaim mundane astrologer william lilly kind establish tradition mundane astrology currently practice haing moon partner th house isnt incribly uncommon lesbian relationship haing doublewhammy h occupation less common see problem square kk likely felt like desire priacy werent respect t t likely felt like kk asham unfortunately there indication neither wrong quite immature tss saturn kks descendant squng kks moon likely didnt help matter sense grow faster want neither knew t almost definitely power situation kk een neither saw time there lot essential dignity within tss chart within kks chart kk combust enus mercury moon ging way freak close ia combusta space libra scorpio lot fix star generally thought enoously difficult planet especially moon jupiter exil whereas tss jupiter exalt conjunct moon domicile essentially mean t doesnt rely others way kk feel thus death knell relationship kk absolutely gae scooter braun infoation t likely coerc infoation gien time frame role scooter braun likely play kks life still decision kk make know would hurt t bad part t almost definitely power help kk kk ask help thing h synastry kk t definitely soulmates kind t thought kk tss twin flame stretch imagination there kind soulmate many esotericists call kaic soulmate intense soulmate ultimately youre suppos pay de eentually separate een say time go word sister come back whisper proe fact seem twin dream shes crook caught there indication like hoax know hero di whats moie know still hurt underneath scar pull apart dark indicate relationship end many mutual h relationship end especially first saturn return usually happens age betray one another kk betray t help scooter braun scott borchetta steal tss master t see likely get last swipe write song relationship many outright mean time haing tss scorpio mar traditional chart ruler likely indicates t doesnt act shes push past point return usually extremely personal betrayal use eery underhand trick book shes rather likely win closure particular likely meticulously design hurt kk later see synastry chart kk eeore see eeore really really hurt kk sure t likely right line nda likely forc sign relationship kk end none us actually know song brutal fact brutality come easily t face betrayal doesnt help t placidus h moon chart indicate strong tendency betray people trust eentually learns defend kind betrayal future unfortunately part likely irreconcilable ety reason t likely willing budge position problem almost definitely mistake kks part t act best interest underhand thing likely justifi kk lie fact neer lie t fact large number people hate kk despite haing neer met kk chose fame oer loe end realiz fame doesnt keep wa night likely always mourn relationship t way t wont end day t likely mo yes tear beer candle still mo didnt ne kks closure strength kk didnt hae probably still doesnt really kk likely show last era tour concert one specific purpose tell t shes still loe hasnt mo despite rumor contrary t didnt een gie kk chance say face far know kk wasnt init ip tent rest tss friend t didnt want kks closure een ten year likely broke ucat opinion speaks olumes,1,"Concert and Ticket Issues: Discussions about buying, selling, and handling concert tickets, including resale, shipping, and general availability."

I just had to share this moment with some fellow Swifties! 

A lot of times we talk about listening to Taylor's music in public and going like ""omggg it's Taylor"", like she's a super underground artist and not the most famous pop star of the moment. 
The coolest thing happened today.
I was watching a general knowledge contest on TV (in Portugal) and a question popped up along the lines of ""Which of these artists does 'the eras tour', with date set for Portugal in 2024?"". And then the host of the show was going on about how cool Taylor is, about how she's playing 3 and a half hours in the tour, followed by them playing ""miss Americana and the heartbreak prince"" (super surprised by the choice of the song, I was expecting anti-hero tbh 😅 but I'm guessing it's because it opens the tour) and finally ended by asking for a round of applause for Taylor. 
I was silently freaking out and having a proud moment even though it's completely expected that people will talk about her nowadays.

Then it got me thinking, have you had any experience like this, where Taylor appeared in a context you totally were not expecting (not her music, just her or something she did), and did you react the same way as I did?",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/16i0zn2/a_question_about_taylor_on_a_general_knowledge/,A question about Taylor on a general knowledge contest,TaylorSwift,t3_16i0zn2,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/16i0zn2/a_question_about_taylor_on_a_general_knowledge/,2023-09-13 22:28:26,Taylor Swift,0.20312156,0.118420035,"A question about Taylor on a general knowledge contest

I am JUST now learning that people do not like this song. Apologies that this has likely been discussed here many times before. 

It’s one of my favorite songs of hers. Now, I do love ethereal music anyway and that is what I mainly listen to (if any of you actually like Epiphany, I’d recommend the artist Hailaker) although, it also holds a very special meaning to me. 

Aside from the war portion, which was clear-cut, I did not know the song was specifically about healthcare workers at first. 

Upon first listen, I immediately drew the parallel to my own life as a (now) former healthcare worker in the psychiatric field. 

Everything. Everything in this song. All the abuse of patients I witnessed. All the tragedy. All the sleepless nights literally (not used as a filler word, LITERALLY and not metaphorically) searching for some epiphany that would help me decide where to go. What to do. Because working in that field was my life purpose, as I was in psychiatric units as a teenager many times myself and was terribly mistreated so it was my mission to be the difference I wish I would have had. 

 But it didn’t go as planned. I was beaten down and dismissed by my coworkers. I found myself feeling utterly helpless in the face of our terribly broken system. I’d beg the universe, something, whatever may have be out there, for an answer. For a reckoning. I was drowning. 

When I heard, “with you I serve, with you I fall down” I immediately started sobbing, thinking about all my patients, so helpless in the face of the abusive system. All the times I sat on the floor in their dark hospital rooms with them with tears in my eyes. I still start crying whenever I listen to this song. 

Aside from my personal connection, it is an incredible song lyrically and instrumentally. I truly don’t understand why people often don’t like it. 

For those of you that don’t, why? 

For those of you that do, I would love to hear why as well and any stories of personal connection you may have.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/17lu22t/i_need_a_place_to_vent_about_epiphany_for_a_second/,I need a place to vent about Epiphany for a second,TaylorSwift,t3_17lu22t,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/17lu22t/i_need_a_place_to_vent_about_epiphany_for_a_second/,2023-11-02 03:03:54,Taylor Swift,0.14950264,0.046806507,"I need a place to vent about Epiphany for a second

Girl At Home (Red) - WHAT, THIS SONG IS A TOTAL BOP!! i can't believe that a fun pop song like this would not be a little famous song on the fandom, it has a very 1989 vibe to it, it's a relatable song, and that even has a single-potential in my opinion.  
Altough the non-taylor's version is definetly not like this. The stolen version is a country acoustic song that got a lot of hate by reading the comments on YT, and that sucks alot, because this might have made the glorious TV pop version to be forgotten and not heard.

Breathe (Fearless) - ""It's 2am feelling like i've just lost a friend"" this song is sooo relatable, it describes losing that friend you loved so much and you don't know if you will ever see then again, i love this song, i think that even Fearless in general is not talked much in the fandom, most of it's songs i've never even heard no one talk about them, not even fearless stans.

Mary's Song (Debut) - Honestly this song is soooo cute, describing a little childhood friends to lovers and having kids and getting old together, i could see it getting popular when debut tv realeses (along with invisible).  


That's it, i have also other songs like Starlight (Red, TOTAL BOOOPPP!!!), Tell Me Why (Fearless, so 2010's vibe) and You Are In Love (1989, i've heard people tlak abt, but it should be WAAAAAY popular), now it's your turn, am i wrong or right? Share other not know songs.

First and most importantly, *a good quality picture*. No overly pixelated stuff. Second, try not to repost so soon after a pic has already been uploaded. Third, *keep the title concise and to the point.* No overly horny titles. Fourth, it’s not at all required but feel free to use flair! It keeps the sub organized.

Quality &gt; quantity is the way of this sub. Just because you post “random photo dump” with no pattern doesn’t mean it’ll get approved. Those are just lazy. Yes I want quality over quantity but that doesn’t mean your post automatically won’t get approved either, I want as many people to post as possible as long as you make it a good one. I don’t want this to be like other subs where it’s just the mod karma whoring with reposts along with their alt account just to get karma quicker. We’re hitting 80k by March so I’d love to see HELLA new names contributing.

Lastly remember to follow the rules especially when it comes to asking for meetups. Those will get you banned. Also remember to double check if an Olivia photo is of age or not. Just because it’s on other Olivia subs doesn’t mean she was 18 in it but if you’re ever not 100% sure just let me know before you post, it’s usually pretty obvious though.

18736,"I finally listened to the Willow remixes, and goddamn, some of them are actually fantastic. I never really got bothered because I saw them viewed as more of a meme based on how the fandom discussed them, but actually I think some of them are better than the album version as standalone songs. So I decided to rank every version of Willow I felt was significant enough to rank, considering now I've heard enough of them.

&#x200B;

1. Grammys 2020 Performance - Ranking this first may seem anticlimactic given the intro talking exclusively about the remixes, but I truly don't think anyone will fight me on saying that nothing surpasses this. The vocals were so strong, and the instrumentation feels so much more alive. It maintains that acoustic-based Evermore sound by nature of being live, while also being much more exciting to listen to than any other version. Big thumbs up.
2. Willow (Moonlit Witch Version) - This is the perfect bridge between the Evermore album production style and the poppier Elvira remix. It has such a unique sound with the mix of more synth pop elements and the piano and soft vocals of the album version, and it marries very well. The added percussion also drives the song forward a lot more. Maybe not to everyone's taste, but as someone who prefers highly produced music, this really scratched an itch. It also manages to make the transition from ""90s trend"" into the next verse really smooth, and on a lot of versions it sounds a little stilted.
3. Willow (dancing witch version) (Elvira remix) - Elvira needs to do more of these remixes, because this and Love Story were both excellent. My only real issue is that because the vocals are so soft and raw, it can sometimes feel a little at odds with the backing track. I feel like maybe some added effect on Taylor's vocals could have made it work better. But the production itself is so cool. Again, so unique, so fun to listen to, will definitely be streaming more.
4. Willow (album/regular version) - Willow is an alright song. Some nice lyrics, a nice vibe, introduces the general vibe of Evermore pretty well, but nothing about it feels particularly special. Musically, it doesn't do anything super interesting in the same way a lot of the album does, but the melody and vocals are nice, and the production marries well with Taylor's vocals. In terms of the album it makes total sense, but on its own it doesn't really stand out.
5. Willow (instrumental version) - She released it to be purchased so I'm counting it. It's a nice instrumental, but Taylor's vocals and lyrics are what gives the song most of its listenability. 
6. Willow (lonely witch version) - This just felt unnecessary, I don't think the additional piano adds anything to the overall sound, if anything it just makes me appreciate the guitar on the regular version more because the sound of the guitar really compliments the softness of Taylor's vocals, where the piano compliments a fuller voice like in Champagne Problems. It just sounds like Willow from a timeline where worse production choices were made for Evermore.
7. Willow (original songwriting demo) - She released it to be purchased so I'm counting it. The fun of demos is hearing some lyrics that didn't make it in, or some other fun stuff, or a style that didn't end up suiting the final product, but this is just a rough draft, and slightly off key at points. She was just trying to secure the number 1, and I respect it, but I can't imagine this contributes MUCH to sales.

Haunted

Enchanted 

Red

cardigan 

tolerate It 

Cold As You 

White Horse

Love Story

Hi I was listening to Taylor alot during my college years and even as a guy could relate on spiritual level to her aura and essence of artistry packaged in this really cute smokeshow of a talented woman and I could not help but notice she has pretty wild relationships that are referenced in her songs ( like from really sarcastic Blank Space, to somewhat magical realism Wildest Dreams, humble Delicate, hilarious We are Never getting back together and so on..)

This got me thinking since we share lots of personality ( as I can directly relate to most of her music and the Eras tour concert I watched on Xmas day) and I have blue eyes ( so some songs are already relevant in her discography and the news one's after eventual break-up would not be directly referencing me and could fall under vagueness to not disclose everything and blend as well as Eras tour throughout ending sweet without any hint of bitterness)

13101,"commented suggested i crosspost as when i tried to link it in a comment, the og subreddit went private and others couldn't view it 

i wanted to make a ~~concise~~ post about the barbed wire metaphor that appears in both invisible string and tolerate it & london boy became tangentially involved in response to recent ""joe-is-not-a-beard-bc-invisible-string-exists"" discourse 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*Invisible string* has been discussed countless times on this subreddit as an ode to Joe/bearding. Gaylors have considered the repetition of ""isn't it just so pretty to think?"" as an allusion to Hemingway's *The Sun Also Rises*, concluding with ""Isn't it pretty to think so?"" I am unable to find the post I wanted to link and do not want to further analyze this aspect of the song myself, because I haven't read the novel, but the line seems to be a moment of resolution (resignation) between two characters who couldn't maintain a relationship due to sexual incompatibility from biological factors. 

&#x200B;

Within the structure of *invisible string*, Taylor lists a series of disconnected events with superficial descriptors, from the past lives of this person she's singing to and herself, like she's trying to romanticize them as parts of a whole, but isn't really trying too hard. She follows each list with: ""And isn't it just so pretty to think, all along there was some invisible string tying you to me?"" after absolutely nothing among the minute details she offers seems to connect the pair. Further, Taylor seems to dissociate herself from their shared experiences. The takeaway moment she shares from their ""three-year trip"" is the waitress at lunch saying she ""look[s] like an American singer.""

&#x200B;

At no point within *invisible string* does Taylor make any assertions about the way she feels about this person she's tied to. In *London Boy*, she is coy, and dances around affirmations with the phrasing of ""you know I love a London boy,"" revolving the entire song's context around her audience. The subject is ""you,"" not ""I."" It's impersonal; it feels like she's playing around with a fictional narrative. There are a myriad of reasons why we refer to *London Boy* as the bearding track on *Lover*, with hints such as the Idris Elba clip in the intro from an interview where he muses about where he will take a fan on a (performative) date in London, the incongruency of its setting on an album wherein every other track screams that her lover lives in New York City, and its recording being a seemingly last-minute addition to the album. The ambiguous framing of ""isn't it just so pretty to think"" achieves a similar effect. It doesn't really mean anything or establish legitimacy in the narrative. In *invisible string*, Taylor attempts to revisit the fiction from *London Boy*, but nothing exists beyond this image she's created for her audience. The invisible string tying the pair together is a contractual obligation to beard, to present a heteronormative image to the public. She elaborates: ""A string that pulled me out of all the wrong arms right into that dive bar, something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire, chains around my demons, wool to brave the seasons, one single thread of gold tied me to you."" Their partnership protects her by keeping her truth, her sexuality, from the public eye; the ""wrong arms"" she refers to are her lovers'/lover's arms wrapped around her.  The ""mistakes"" she made in love are dangerous to her image, so (potentially) harmful that they must be isolated in barbed wire and chains. Not only are they to be kept inaccessible to others, but also to herself (""he could be my jailer""). She will later refer to her former lover as a rogue, a cowboy, a bandit, and a siren. 

&#x200B;

Taylor returns to her image of barbed wire in *tolerate it*. The succession of lines follows: ""Where's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire? I made you my temple, my mural, my sky."" The latter  undeniably refers to her *Lover* album and era. The album has many key details that lead us to believe it is mainly, if not entirely, about her relationship with Karlie Kloss, and many of the songs contain religious allusions. In both lyrics and in interviews, Taylor has declared Karlie as the sun, or sunshine. Taylor had a mural painted of butterfly wings in Nashville for *ME!/Lover* promotion by Kelsey Montague (who had been previously acknowledged by this community for her Kaylor fanart). The wings are reminiscent of those that Karlie wore on the Victoria's Secret runway as an angel, and include many motifs that seem to reference their relationship, including giraffe print, rainbows, and daisies (""The thing about Karlie is that she’s very tall like an elephant or a giraffe or a very, very high ceiling. You really have trouble getting through doors that are low. You walked the Victoria’s Secret show the other day and you looked like a fairy butterfly. And I was so proud of you ‘cause I was like ‘that’s my friend!’ and I knew you were singing all the words to my song and she’s walking, she’s got wings, she’s got shiny abs. She said we’d go on a road trip and when we went there and we went to Big Sur and I drove and I played you the whole 1989 album before anyone else heard it.""*)*

&#x200B;

The continuation of barbed wire imagery evidences it as Taylor's internalized containment of her sexuality. Barbed wire is indiscriminately painful. Taylor had several (alleged) beards across her relationship with Karlie: Calvin, Tom, and finally, Joe. Karlie, by metaphorically throwing blankets over Taylor's barbed wire, lets her escape the confinement. She steps over it and enters a pretty publicized relationship with Karlie (""the rogue who coaxed you into paradise and left you there""), and is temporarily able to compartmentalize her bearding arrangements as sort of projected gender-bended identities for the muse in her lyrics. When Karlie leaves to start a family with her man, Taylor no longer has padding surrounding her barbed wire, and she must bare the pain of closeting by her lonesome. Her shelter becomes this invisible string she has with Joe, and there is no alternate reality for solace. But isn't it just so pretty to think the invisible string could be something beautiful?

She steps over it and enters a pretty publicized relationship with Karlie (""the rogue who coaxed you into paradise and left you there""), and is temporarily able to compartmentalize her bearding arrangements as sort of projected gender-bended identities for the muse in her lyrics. When Karlie leaves to start a family with her man, Taylor no longer has padding surrounding her barbed wire, and she must bare the pain of closeting by her lonesome. Her shelter becomes this invisible string she has with Joe, and there is no alternate reality for solace. But isn't it just so pretty to think the invisible string could be something beautiful?

18914,"Ok, I am in no way a swiftie, but my friend challenged me to go through the entire discography to *force* myself to become one. She bribed me with my favorite snickerdoodles and I'm a sugar addict so I took her up on it. I spent a couple days of my free time going through everything and now I have very strong opinions of taylor swift music, so my friend told me to share these here with you!

First, I LOVE reputation. I know a lot of people are turned off by the dark nature, but only three or four songs are actually about the whole revenge theme. The rest are cynical love songs about romance that might be doomed, and I love it. Just a thought though: So It Goes...? Not the biggest fan. TIWWCHNT was a bit much for me. KOMH is my fave (followed by Dress, Getaway Car, Delicate, End Game bc of Ed Sheeran, and Don't Blame Me). stunning album, i could have that voice playing on repeat for a week

lover: spectacular songs, and then terrible songs. I think he knows, I forgot you existed, the man, YNTCD, INTHAF all deserve to burn in hell. I don't know why, but they are just so annoying. HOWEVER, cruel summer, MA&THP, AOTGYLB, paper rings, need (unreleased) are sooo pretty. DBATC was too light and sunny for such a dark title. too many skips for me overall

red: last summer, a friend found out that i wasn't a ts fan and demanded i put red tv on my spotify. one day, i decided to listen to it and put it on shuffle. i did not enjoy it. at all. ATW 10 min, while pretty, is not for me, and i couldn't get into anything else really.

debut: i know she was young when she recorded it, but her voice is just...sigh. couldn't get into it. picture to burn and should've said no were too childish. only tim mcgraw and TOMG were good, but then again, i'm not much of a country girl

fearless: YBWM and love story are iconic. I love them. i also love mr perfectly fine and the way i love you. Maybe I'll find others I like, but for now, I'm not exactly going to stream fearless on repeat.

folklore & evermore: stripped back indie style that i like in many other artists, so theoretically i should like it in these. actual assessment: meh. Cardigan was great, August didn't really connect with me(but I just heard the TSITP version and loved it so once that is released I will be streaming it), and Betty wasn't as cohesive and mature as those two. warmed up to champagne problems. love gold rush (except for the intro and outro, the song is already short and it legit takes out 40 seconds for awful vocals). no body, no crime gives reputation but stripped and i adore it. overall pretty decent, but not my go to.

speak now: somehow her voice sounds less mature than fearless. i didn't like dear john as much as they said i would. I didn't like Back to December as much as they said I would. I didn't like Speak Now as much as they said I would. I didn't like Sparks Fly as much as they said I would. I like Mean from my childhood so that was a fun listen. Enchanted was pretty on tiktok audios, but seemed worse with the studio version. I'm hoping the re recorded version makes her voice sound more mature so I can listen to that instead.

better than revenge...sigh. catchy as hell. petty as hell. slut shames like hell. treats men like objects that can't think for themselves like hell. if it was written by a man slut shaming women and treating women like trophies, it would be canceled like hell. has women across the internet denounce feminism for a 3 min song demonizing a girl for simply dating a guy she liked like hell. Ultimately, this song made me lose so much respect for her. I had always thought, despite not being a fan, that she got too much hate. listening to this made me understand exactly why some people think she is a b\*tch...because she writes like one. the only redeeming quality would be if the rerecord drastically changed the lyrics, so we'll see what happens

midnights: pop album that rocked the world. my world? not so much. Antihero was disappointingly pop and not dark like I expected. bejeweled and karma were kinda annoying. lavender haze? kind of mid-tier. maroon, great war, WCS were redeemers though. midnight rain should've had another verse or a bridge. Right now it seems like a half done song. ultimately a disappointing album for Past Me trying desperately to become a swiftie.

So here are my unpopular opinions. Let me know your thoughts and if there are any songs I should check out, particularly if they give the lover-reputation vibe.

edit: just realized i forgot 1989, so here it is:

loved the singles. they will forever be iconic. (wildest dreams is my favorite, but blank space closely follows). i did not like out of the woods and new romantics that much for some reason. i know places, however, is stunning. bad blood, while definitely good, struck me as the kind of song you get tired of listening to too often. the rest kind of fell flat to me though. i know back in the day this was, like, a revolutionary album, but right now after listening to her whole discography, i don't feel it that much. i feel like lover, midnights, and rep did pop songs much better. maybe this is just her getting better as the years progress, but i really didn't see why it is her most popular album.

also, a note with btr: i understand the context behind it, and i know how it may have colored a young women's view of the situation. i also understand that the late 2000s weren't the greatest time for toxic attitudes regarding dating. let me be clear, i also disapprove of other songs with similar rhetoric, with both men and women as the narrators and subjects. however, context doesn't excuse actions (if it did, how easy would it be to disapprove problematic behaviors due to the time period? is it ok to be racist if the time period allows it? just a thought) and we have to look at it from an unbiased lens.

I did some digging when i heard the song to find the background info and discovered that taylor swift was interviewed about the problematic nature of the lyrics. her response? i'm paraphrasing ofc, but she said that she was 19 when she wrote it and that she has since figured out that a man cannot be ""stolen"" away unless he really wanted to leave. spot-on and accurate conclusion, but that's it. she doesn't address the slut shaming, or treating boyfriends like trophies utilized in pissing contests, or anything else. she leaves it at that. if she had addressed the other, much more problematic aspects of the song, i could've probably excused it. but instead, she pivoted. so that just really turned me off to it. thank you for listening to my ted talk",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/14gt7wa/my_bestie_challenged_me_to_become_a_swiftie_here/,"My bestie challenged me to become a Swiftie, here are my controversial opinions:",TaylorSwift,t3_14gt7wa,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/14gt7wa/my_bestie_challenged_me_to_become_a_swiftie_here/,2023-06-23 08:45:49,Taylor Swift,0.23739935,0.15586677,"My bestie challenged me to become a Swiftie, here are my controversial opinions: Ok, I am in no way a swiftie, but my friend challenged me to go through the entire discography to *force* myself to become one.

I did some digging when i heard the song to find the background info and discovered that taylor swift was interviewed about the problematic nature of the lyrics. her response? i'm paraphrasing ofc, but she said that she was 19 when she wrote it and that she has since figured out that a man cannot be ""stolen"" away unless he really wanted to leave. spot-on and accurate conclusion, but that's it. she doesn't address the slut shaming, or treating boyfriends like trophies utilized in pissing contests, or anything else. she leaves it at that. if she had addressed the other, much more problematic aspects of the song, i could've probably excused it. but instead, she pivoted. so that just really turned me off to it. thank you for listening to my ted talk",bestie challeng become controersial opinion ok way friend challeng go entire discography force become one brib faorite snickerdoodles im r addict take spent couple day free time go eerything hae ery strong opinion music friend told share first loe reputation know lot people turn dark nature three four song actually whole reenge theme rest cynical loe song romance might doom loe thought though go big fan tiwwchnt bit much komh fae follow dress getaway car delicate end game bc dont blame stun album could hae oice play repeat week loer spectacular song terrible song think know forgot exist man yntcd inthaf desere burn hell dont know annoy howeer cruel summer mathp aotgylb paper ring ne unreleas sooo pretty dbatc light sunny dark title many skip oerall r last summer friend found wasnt t fan demand put r spotify one day decid listen put shuffle enjoy atw min pretty couldnt get anything else really debut know young record oice justsigh couldnt get picture burn shoulde say childish tim mcgraw tomg good im much country girl fearless ybwm loe story iconic loe also loe mr perfectly fine way loe maybe ill find others like im exactly go stream fearless repeat folklore eeore stripp back indie style like many artist theoretically like actual assessment meh cardigan great august didnt really connect mebut heard tsitp ersion lo releas stream betty wasnt cohesie mature two wa champagne problem loe gold rush except intro outro song already short legit take second awful ocals body crime gy reputation stripp adore oerall pretty decent go speak somehow oice sound less mature fearless didnt like dear john much say would didnt like back december much say would didnt like speak much say would didnt like spark fly much say would like mean childhood fun listen enchant pretty tiktok audio seem bad studio ersion im hop record ersion make oice sound mature listen instead well reengesigh catchy hell petty hell slut shame like hell treat men like object cant think themseles like hell write man slut sham woman treat woman like trophy would cancel like hell woman across internet denounce feminism min song demonize girl simply date guy lik like hell ultimately song make lose much respect always thought despite fan get much hate listen make understand exactly people think btchbecause writes like one reeming quality would rerecord drastically chang lyric well see happens midnight pop album rock world world much antihero disappointingly pop dark like expect bejewel kaa kinda annoy laender haze kind midtier maroon great war wcs reemers though midnight rain shoulde another erse bridge right seem like half do song ultimately disappoint album past try desperately become unpopular opinion let know thought song check particularly gie loerreputation ibe realiz forgot lo single foreer iconic wild dream faorite blank space closely follow like wood new romantic much reason know place howeer stun bad blood definitely good struck kind song get tir listen often rest kind fell flat though know back day like reolutionary album right listen whole discography dont feel much feel like loer midnight rep pop song much well maybe get well year progress really didnt see popular album also note btr understand context behind know may hae color young woman iew situation also understand late werent great time toxic attitude regard date let clear also disapproe song similar rhetoric men woman narrator subject howeer context doesnt excuse action easy would disapproe problematic behaiors due time period ok racist time period allows thought hae look unbias lens dig heard song find background info discoer interiew problematic nature lyric response im paraphrase ofc say write since figur man cannot steal away unless really want leae spoton accurate conclusion thats doesnt address slut sham treat boyfriend like trophy utiliz piss contest anything else leaes address much problematic aspect song coulde probably excus instead piot really turn thank listen talk,8,"Music and Lyrics: Discussions and reflections on the emotional and personal impact of music, including how lyrics relate to relationships, identity, and cultural experiences."

20244,"My admiration for this song grows with every listen. It's such a short track and yet weaves such a poignant arc in both its songwriting and sound. I love how the lyrics evolve from an innocent story about unrequited teenage love to a darker one about self-loathing and dashed ambitions (with a piercing reference to her eating disorder), only to end on a surprisingly inspiring note about seizing the moment and letting go of fear. And it goes by in such a flash that it requires a few listens to really see its brilliance. The little symmetries between the lyrics in each verse give the song this lovely triptych structure, and make it feel like a story about the three stages of her self-esteem. 

The production is every bit as good, and as someone who's a bit tired of Jack Antonoff's shtick, this is absolutely one of his best beats. The song could've easily been another stripped-down piano ballad and worked perfectly fine, but it was an inspired choice to instead give it this thrumming, ODESZA-esque house beat that grows in power over the course of the song. The cathartic buildup and those rock drum fills in the climax make this song feel stadium-ready, and I'm surprised it wasn't on the Eras Tour tracklist. It would've killed.

The song also reminds me of a bunch of others I love. The first half of the beat is similar to Everything I Wanted by Billie Eilish, while the vocal melody sounds a lot like the pre-chorus of Castle on the Hill (the lyrics about reminiscence add to the similarities too). The distorted synths that end the track after the emotional crescendo feel like an homage to Billie's Happier Than Ever title track. Whatever the song's influences were, it wears them well.

Overall a brilliant, brilliant, track. Infectiously catchy, too.

I have been listening to “You’re Losing Me” nonstop since she has officially released it on streaming since it’s a little personal to me right now lol. Obviously I’ve been replaying the bridge over and over again too because it just hits different screaming at the top of my lungs in the car alone. I starting tying to analyze the lines of “fighting in only your army, frontlines don’t you ignore me” while I originally interpreted this as her saying she was loyal to him and wishing he would pay more attention to her trying to keep him, I started thinking of this more along the lines of “The Great War” with her references to troops and going through a tough time together and saying that “I would always be yours ‘cause we survived the Great War”. In that song I’ve also always liked the “say a solemn prayer, place a poppy in my hair” “we will never go back to that bloodshed, crimson clover” because of the catchiness of it but now I googled crimson clover and found some symbolism with that and symbolism of poppies and am now wondering if the crimson clover line may be referencing when she wrote “You’re Losing Me” in December 2021 since crimson clovers are a winter plant (see attached photos). We would never go back to that bloodshed crimson clover meaning: horrible times/fighting or whatever they specifically went through in the tough times of their relationship, and the crimson clover representing how broken she felt to write “You’re Losing Me”. 

Like is “The Great War” a nod to “You’re Losing Me” (or vice versa) now that we’re all fully convinced Midnights was a breakup album but she obviously couldn’t tell us that at the time since they were still together???

I do find it interesting that 3 of them are working on a contract when she walks in and the rest get in line behind the one holding the contract.

The "" getaway car"" scene in the background visuals on tour featured a specific Jaguar E-Type and surprising was never featured in a bond film but in a James Bond Spoof. I always wondered why Taylor had 8 background dancers in tuxedo jacket scrambling in line behind her. The suits are giving bond vibes and the radio cell are giving Brosner vibes.

The spoof parody James Bond film in 1967 Casino Royale ( not Casino Royale in 2008 with Daniel Craig ) narrative was an older Bond enlisting 7 more bonds "" to confuse enemies and audience of who the real Bond was "" ... Sound familiar? There was a scene with a female James bond lining up potential new Bonds and picked him based on how he looked on paper. For this Bond in the movie his next test was to not be able to be seduced by women as his power.

The film is widely known to be a trainwreck as it had 12 writers , 5 directors including Woody Allen who also played ""Jimmy Bond"" , 8 seperate James Bond plots that had nothing to do with each other. However the biggest success of the film was they had Dusty Springfield sing 'The Look of Love "" created for the theme song for the film . The song is so immortal that it was used again for the real Casino Royale Bond movie with Daniel Craig ( which was his first film in the franchise.) It's clear Taylor Swift is influenced by Dusty Springfield especially in Reputation but to represent her in that scene never made sense till you look at them as mocking a James bond scene. I'm not entirely sure if she's mocking Tom's ambitions or the Media speculation on his ambitions dating Taylor to get noticed for a Bond Role. ...

31858,"…because she’ll be doing all she can to get reputation a Grammy, most likely out of the vault tracks.

There’s been a lot of speculation that she’s going to go all out with 1989 TV promo since was such a massive hit the first time. However, I have a different theory.

1989 OG has already earned the distinction of being the most awarded pop album of all time. It was the Grammys Album Of The Year and a commercial + critical success. The TV will be massive no matter what she does, and will have the largest public reach of the TVs so far, bc it’s the first fully pop TV. It will garner a lot of headlines and conversation without her needing to say a word.

She’s also releasing it during a break in her tour schedule, so she can very easily lie low and let the music speak for itself (and then hopefully perform some of the vault songs during her November concert dates). 

As such, I anticipate that 1989 TV will get something similar to the Speak Now treatment: a social media post, a music video for a vault track, and celebrations at the next concert dates after the release. Frankly I think it would be a misstep to do much more than that, because it’ll already be all over the media & airwaves. This was the era wherein she first reached the danger zone of overexposure; we don’t want to go there again. (Also, she’s limited in what promo she can do even she wants to, since the strikes have shut down all the popular talk shows in the US)

I think reputation TV, meanwhile, will get something more like the Red TV treatment. I know the fans tend to say Red got all of the attention because it’s Taylor’s “favorite child,” but I think it was also in part because she was going after the Grammy that Red OG missed out on— and she got it!! She got 3 nominations total for the album, and, given that no other music video got the kind of attention that ATW10 did last year, it was the obvious choice for Best Music Video. (It was also a very strategic choice to make “I Bet You Think About Me” a single with its own mv, because it could get a nom for country song without competing with ATW10 for the Song Of The Year.)

Much like Red, the OG reputation did not win any Grammys, and we know from Miss Americana how much that disappointed her (side note, was anyone else put off by the way the documentary showed her being disappointed that it wasn’t nominated in the AOTY/ROTY/SOTY category but failed to mention that she *was* nominated in the best pop album category? I understand her disappointment & think it’s valid, but I think it disingenuously implied that rep didn’t get *any* noms). 

Anyway, she now she has a massive opportunity to get rep its Grammy, and as a rep girlie, I’m all for it!! Its original release was great by most artists’ standards, but subpar by Taylor’s standard because she was emerging from a big dip in popularity after the “snake” stuff, and she chose to minimize promo as “there will be no explanation.” Rep TV being released when she’s at an all time high in popularity like the Eras tour is giving her has absolutely massive potential.

Currently the theory is that she’ll announce Rep TV in Feb. The 2024 Grammys are on Feb 4th, and all signs point to Midnights getting multiple noms; she’s got a great opportunity to announce Rep TV at the Grammys or when her tour resumes a few days later in Tokyo while she still (hopefully) riding the high of a Grammy win. 

From there, she doesn’t even have to talk shows (staying consistent with “there will be no explanation”), but she can go all out with top tier vault tracks (there must be some bangers, considering rep didn’t even get a deluxe version) and (multiple?) music videos. If she switched things up and did give even one interview about writing the album, it would be extremely popular because of how little she shared about its conception initially.

If she plays her cards right, the rep vault has a very good chance of landing her a ROTY, that elusive SOTY, or even another “best music video” at the 2025 Grammys. 

(Disclaimer: I love rep and don’t think it needs any Grammys. I hope she has let go of the idea that Grammys can determine an album’s worth.

2344,"Hello! My name is Cokebottlewithnolid and I am hosting a game called Swiftie Bingo!

  How to Play:  The bingo card template that I have created can be found in the link, please make a copy.   

You must choose 10 songs from each of Taylor’s 10 Albums (Taylor Swift, Fearless, Speak Now, Red, 1989, Reputation, Lover, folklore, evermore, Midnights.) All songs from deluxe versions will be called, however extra things (Piano/Pop versions, voice memos, messages, etc.) will not be called, then add them to their respective cells  

Then choose 4 FTV tracks from each of the four TV albums, please do not use TV songs. And finally, the 5 Wild spaces are where you can choose any song from any of the 10 albums or FTV tracks. Please do not choose songs that are from Beautiful Eyes, any of the Christmas tunes or any singles unless they are from their specific album.

  Each day I will be randomly spinning a wheel and posting the result of the wheel, if you have that specific song, use the line tool or something that will show you that the song has been called. 

 A Songs Called List will be posted with the bingo call for anyone to make sure that any missing songs have been crossed off, or for anyone who wants to join the game. 

 We will be following classic American Bingo rules, so the winners of each of the different patterns will win the following: 

 Line-A shoutout 

II-A shoutout 

Blackout-A certificate   

Rules:  Ronan is not going to be called or should be used in this game due to the r/taylorgameswannaplay rules. 

 If you get a bingo, immediately call bingo in the comments of the most recent song post, do NOT wait until you have multiple lines to call bingo, the first person that calls it will get the win.  

If a song that you have missed gets you a bingo, DO NOT call bingo, if you have missed crossing off songs and you get a bingo from the most recent song, then you may call bingo  

Please don’t fake fake fake fake fake, it ruins the game for everyone.

18874,"Ok so I saw this theory (and maybe this is something everyone knows and I’m just late to the party) but apparently Taylor wanted to write a song about ‘Twilight: New Moon’ and ‘Haunted’ is a song from Bella’s POV, which I literally cannot unhear now, especially because the 2nd verse references her with another man that can make her somewhat happy but she still misses the first guy. 

She was dating Taylor Lautner leading up to her ‘Speak Now’ era and New Moon/the whole Twilight franchise was growing increasingly popular so it makes a ton of sense.

With this in mind I was listening to ‘Midnight Rain’ today which many people think may be referring to her relationship with Taylor Lautner and why she decided to end things. In the song she sings at the end “sometimes we all get some kind of haunted” and I’m wondering if that’s not a coincidence.

# What's going on?

A recent Reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in the official mobile app **permanently inaccessible** to users.

On May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make  calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every  third party app on Reddit, from [Apollo](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/) to [Reddit is Fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/13wxepd/rif_dev_here_reddits_api_changes_will_likely_kill/) to [Narwhal](https://www.reddit.com/r/getnarwhal/comments/13wv038/reddit_have_quoted_the_apollo_devs_a_ridiculous/jmdqtyt/) to [BaconReader](https://www.reddit.com/r/baconreader/comments/13wveb2/reddit_api_changes_and_baconreader/).

Even if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps,  this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as  Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface .

This isn't only a problem on the user level: many subreddit  moderators depend on tools only available outside the official app to  keep their communities on-topic and spam-free.

# What's the plan?

On June 12th, [many subreddits](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) will be going dark to protest this policy. Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away *permanently*  unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't  able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through  the official app. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what  we do because *we love Reddit*, and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.

The two-day blackout isn't the *goal*, and it isn't the end.  Should things reach the 14th with no sign of Reddit choosing to fix what  they've broken, we'll use the community and buzz we've built between  then and now as a tool for further action.

6914,"When I first heard Sweet Nothing, I thought that she meant it as in ""you say you love me but it doesn't have any weight to it."" Over time though, I kept hearing that Sweet Nothing was a love song that talks about wanting to stay with someone. It doesn't fully feel like that though, and You're Losing Me fully explains what's going on and confirms what I first thought about the song.

I'm going to analyse each verse here.

**Verse 1**: ""A pebble that we picked up last July / Down deep inside your pocket / We almost forgot it""

At first, this seems like she just talks about a random pebble they found several months ago. Personally, I didn't find it that important before, but now the pebble appears to represent their memories together. It's deep inside his pocket, so it was a long time ago, but they almost forgot it. It seems as if all their good times together has almost been forgotten and taken for granted.

**Chorus**: ""I find myself running home to your sweet nothings / ... / All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothing""

These two mentions of ""sweet nothings""/""sweet nothing"" sound different from each other. The first mention might suggest that Taylor always goes home to Joe so that he could cheer her up with his sweet nothings and saying everything's okay, In the second mention it seems like Joe doesn't ask her for anything that's too much of her and accepts her the way she is.

In the second chorus, the way she sings ""sweet nothing"" is different from the first chorus, since now her pitch goes down, suggesting that she thought she liked his words, but then realised that she wanted more than just that. It has a darker undertone that suggests he loves her, but that was it. He might only love Taylor because he loves her, but he wasn't able to give her the things she needs. ""How can you say that you love someone you can't tell is dyin'?"". He might be sweet to Taylor, but his words are really just worth nothing when he doesn't want to marry her or help her with her problems. She also gets rid of the ""sweet"", meaning that what she once considered 'sweet' no longer is as she now thinks that Joe doesn't want her at all. This ties well to ""And I wouldn't marry me either / A pathological people pleaser / Who only wanted you to see her"".

**Verse 2**: ""I wrote a poem / You say, 'What a mind' / This happens all the time""

It seems here that Joe is still impressed with her, but he keeps repeating his words to the point that they've lost their meaning. He keeps saying that she's a genius, but Taylor doesn't get more praise than that, and it feels like she might've wanted Joe to talk more about how good the poems were, not just how she's amazing. Here there seems to be some distance. What seems good at first doesn't feel right.

This part is one of the parts that really made me doubt the sweetness of this song. ""This happens all the time"" sounds so sad, especially with her dipping into the low notes. She's pretending to be okay with it, but is disappointed that there's not much more.

**Bridge**: ""Industry disruptors and soul deconstructors / And smooth-talking hucksters out glad-handing each other / And the voices that implore, 'You should be doing more' / To you, I can admit that I'm just too soft for all of it""

This bridge mostly just tells us that she doesn't like what society does these days, nor how people expect her to do more for the less fortunate, and that she goes home to Joe and admits that she can't handle all of that. It shows how she cares more about him than all of those problems, and that she can confide in him for everything.

However, it also seems like these world problems has its own parallels in her life. She has her own 'Anti-Hero' selves that make her become an 'industry disruptor' herself, and these selves 'deconstruct' her own 'soul'. She also has tons of people convincing her how she's a bad person (""smooth-talking hucksters"").

The imagery might also reflect her feeling toward Joe. She sees people ""glad-handing each other"" and reflects on how distant she is to Joe now. The ""voices that implore"" might not just be the public referring to her, but the voices in her own head speaking silently to Joe, telling him to do more for her - '""Do something, babe, say something"" / ""Lose something, babe, risk something"" / ""Choose something, babe, I got nothing"" (I got nothing) / ""To believe, unless you're choosing me""'. All these parallels are overwhelming her, and she wants to admit to Joe what she's now feeling about him.

**TL;DR**: Sweet Nothing talks about a relationship that might sound nice at first, but she actually wants more from Joe than what she's currently receiving.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/13t46e4/youre_losing_me_explains_sweet_nothing_quite_a_lot/,You're Losing Me explains Sweet Nothing quite a lot.,TaylorSwift,t3_13t46e4,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/13t46e4/youre_losing_me_explains_sweet_nothing_quite_a_lot/,2023-05-27 10:46:38,Taylor Swift,0.21241048,0.15840553,"You're Losing Me explains Sweet Nothing quite a lot.

33148,"Is it just me or are there other people out there as well who think Sweet Nothing is actually a sad song, despite it's happy sound... Or even a bit passive agressive?

 was afraid to post this in the past bc of the reaction I might get for it, but now with the date of ""You're Losing Me"" having been revealed and more people finally willing to accept that some of Taylor's not so happy songs were in fact about Joe, I feel like I can finally discuss this. 

I was going through a rough patch in my own relationship and while listening to the song I have noticed some subtleties, that I have previously overlooked.

""They said the end is coming"" - (I am not sure if this says anything about the relationship in particular, but this could be related to the fact that people around Joe and Taylor may have been speculating that they might break up; could be both close ones, who knew their struggles, and the media questioning whether they would be getting married or split)

""I find myself running home to your sweet nothings

Outside, they're push and shoving

You're in the kitchen humming

All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothing"" - this is the part that first got me thinking: people keep speculating and pressuring Taylor and Joe on the topic of marriage. Taylor is questioning the relationship, as we know now since she was hinting she wanted marriage, but Joe wasn't proposing, and she is dealing with all of the outsider comments on her own, whilst he is living carefree, humming. She says all he ever wanted from her was sweet nothing. What I understood from that is that he only wanted her when she was carefree and drama free. So she had to deal with all of the judgement on her own, while he was completely ignoring it. She probably felt like she was in that fight alone. Now we also know that one of the reasons they broke up was that they wanted different things, aka Taylor wanted to keep her career and he probably wanted it to end so they could have ""peace"". Taylor probably began to feel like he doesn't accept her wholy or support her. Maybe in the beginning she was more focused on protecting him and making sure that he feels comfortable, but she realized that he wasn't doing the same for her. He was probably just being  oblivious to her concerns or even dismissive, failling to make her feel acknowledged and cared for.

""On the way home

I wrote a poem

You say, ""What a mind""

This happens all the time"" - to me that part sounded sarcastic or even passive agressive... Frustrated... As if whenever she writes a song she probably goes to him hipped up and excited about it, only to get the same lackluster reaction from him everytime. She sounded annoyed and tired to me. This also reminded me of how people highlighted that he would barely mention her in interviews or show her any praise. This could be bc of indifference or even outright jealousy, in my opinion.

I am not writing this post trying to instigate anything. I nor like or dislike Joe. I just wanted to share my perspective of the song to see if there is anyone else out there who may have interpreted it this way or also felt that the song was pointing at some of the issues in their relationship.

You're On Your Own Kid - ""I didn't choose this town, I dream of getting out"". Is this her hometown in Pennsylvania? Because I imagine she chose Nashville. Or is it maybe heading off to LA at some point when her career started to blow up?

[Here's an article about her](https://www.goethe.de/prj/tbp/en/eps/ssf.html). Her lyrics remind me a lot of Taylor's and I feel like she would love the story of Sybille. On [the website Sybille's son set up for her](https://sibyllebaier.com/photos/), there is a super sweet picture of Sybille with her cat.

30061,"Folklore and Evermore stand out because Taylor entrusted much of the songwriting with Aaron Dessner. 

Taylor Swift has a habit of writing lyrics that don’t work on the page, and only work in the song. By that I mean she often sings few-syllable words as many-syllable words. 

This can work in songs for various reasons, for instance, most people enjoy the song Cruel Summer in which Taylor sings the words “cru-oo-oo-ool suh-um-mer.” But in the wrong context, this lyrical style can often feel tiresome and not very tasteful. 

Aaron Dessner helps Taylor use extra words to make the lyrics “click” into a structure more effectively as opposed to elongating a single word.

8574,"SO I completely forgot I made this a couple of months ago! I found it randomly on my desktop and thought I would post because I think conceptually it still sorta holds up.

It's based on everyone talking about ""dreams"" and ""wild"" being in all of Taylor's post-concert posts. I think this is pointing to the burning bed image on the screen during Wildest Dreams performance at the Eras tour. Think about it - this image really doesn't cohere at all with that song, the 1989 era, or the tour in general. It seems really random. However, it could tie into the burning of the lover house (i.e. it's the next era) AND the orange door at the end (because of the orange glow of the fire).

So I mocked up a concept for TS11 that uses that image - with a phoenix in the top right corner that becomes the main motif of the (hopefully more subtle) merch. I've also included a little blurb explanation for each song. (Disclaimer: I'm not a graphic designer by any stretch of the imagination: I made this using royalty free images in powerpoint - please be kind!)

Taylor has made a lot of references to fire/burning throughout her discography (burning bridges, picture to burn, burning witches, writing letters addressed to, ashes, etc - there's probably heaps more I can't think of right now. Even the idea of guiding light /fireworks fits in). It feels fitting to finally have an album dedicated to fire but emphasising the idea of rebirth (especially if its a breakup album, though it my mind it is also an album of vulnerability, self-love, and choosing oneself).

Let me know what you think!

I found it randomly on my desktop and thought I would post because I think conceptually it still sorta holds up.

It's based on everyone talking about ""dreams"" and ""wild"" being in all of Taylor's post-concert posts. I think this is pointing to the burning bed image on the screen during Wildest Dreams performance at the Eras tour. Think about it - this image really doesn't cohere at all with that song, the 1989 era, or the tour in general. It seems really random. However, it could tie into the burning of the lover house (i.e. it's the next era) AND the orange door at the end (because of the orange glow of the fire).

So I mocked up a concept for TS11 that uses that image - with a phoenix in the top right corner that becomes the main motif of the (hopefully more subtle) merch. I've also included a little blurb explanation for each song. (Disclaimer: I'm not a graphic designer by any stretch of the imagination: I made this using royalty free images in powerpoint - please be kind!)

Taylor has made a lot of references to fire/burning throughout her discography (burning bridges, picture to burn, burning witches, writing letters addressed to, ashes, etc - there's probably heaps more I can't think of right now. Even the idea of guiding light /fireworks fits in). It feels fitting to finally have an album dedicated to fire but emphasising the idea of rebirth (especially if its a breakup album, though it my mind it is also an album of vulnerability, self-love, and choosing oneself).

Let me know what you think!

21321,"After the release of 1989 Taylor’s version, I realized quite a bit of things between 1989 and Lover that I haven’t seen enough people talk about. 

First things first, how they came to be. As Taylor mentions from after the Grammys for red, she decided to go a different approach and take a happier more poppy sound because the melancholic writing god that is Red got snubbed bad. Similarly, Reputation was a more melancholic album that also got snubbed badly which led Taylor to say she’ll “make a better album” which then created Lover. 

Second, Taylor had a similar lead single. Shake it Off was the lead single for 1989 and ME! was the lead for Lover. They have very similar attitudes and production, yet the reason why ME! was received as bad as it was in comparison to Shale it off is because Shake it off still came from the young fun pop singer, while ME! came from what Hollywood perception of old and on their way out of relevancy. Obviously she’s not that, but even she had these feelings herself since in the Miss Americana Documentary, she talked about herself as if Lover was her last chance to make a statement and impact, which is really sad to think about. 

Lastly, even the aesthetics now are very similar to eachother. Both 1989TV and Lover are film aesthetics (while lover doesn’t have the border like 1989, it does have the film flare on the right edge like some film) and they have the album title over their heads with only the sky in the background. 

Idk maybe I’m just reaching to make think connections, but I’ve just noticed those similarities.

A couple days ago, (again with the devastation of the wonderland blanket being sold out), the canada store restocked the blanket and i ran to buy it, however it would not ship to the US. They locked the US region and lots of other people were complaining about the same thing on here. 

Im moving to another state 12/21 so these drops have been making me anxious knowing how unpredictable the shipping is. 

After i ordered i messaged them saying i put my future address but may have to change my address if it ships sooner. They told me not to worry, the ornaments will ship out starting 12/22.

Then i realized i forgot to add my apartmebt number! So i sent anogher message and got this back:

9289,"I am talking about the 3am edition.

Everyone always talks about how poetic and well-written Folklore and Evermore are, and I absolutely agree, they are in another tier compared to her previous albums, in my opinion. But I don’t understand why everyone leaves Midnights out, when I find it to be just as poetic and lyrical as her two previous albums. In my mind, Midnights (if we leave out the most pop songs, such as Bejeweled or Karma, which by the way I love too) is overall just a darker and more intense version of Folklore & Evermore, and I’m confused when people just forget about it when they want to praise Taylor’s writing.

I mean, lyrics such as:

“Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye/you were bigger than the whole sky”

“Every single thing I touch becomes sick with sadness”

“The tomb won't close, stained glass windows in my mind/I regret you all the time”

“I wake up screaming from dreaming/One day I'll watch as you're leaving/And life will lose all its meaning/(For the last time)”

“All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothing” 

“Do I really have to chart the constellations in his eyes?”

are definitely comparable, maybe not to The Lakes, but at least to most songs of Folklore & Evermore.

So I made a [post last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gaylor_Swift/comments/17gkk7i/my_swiftie_friend_was_talking_affectionately/) asking for the community's insights on ""boyfriend Taylor"" and speculation on whether it would be OK to let my IRL friend know I'm a Gaylor. Thank you for the encouragement! These are *trying times, but we're not dying*.

I managed to broach the subject with my friend by expressing my annoyance with the 1989 TV prologue; something about how unfair it is that Blondie built her whole brand on easter eggs, going so far as to leave clues about muses in her liner notes--yet plays the victim and acts as if we're crazy for coming to conclusions based on her art and public history.

Her face lit up, *and that was the moment I knew*. We bonded like never before over all the clues that neither of us had missed. It's a little silly how relieved I was! This is a relatively new friend, and I'd been worried about her reaction to this deep, dark secret of mine, despite her own queer tendencies / acceptance.

It's been an absolute *wonderland* of sharing insights and theories. She isn't quite as chronically online as I am, so I've had the joy of sharing some tidbits with her that she didn't know about. (bi colors ""PROUD"" bracelet (with bonus rainbow filter!) , scissors jewelry, ""...Ready For It?"" switching from ""he"" to ""you"" (there are others; we'll get there), the nuance of ""The Man"" (bitches & models), Jack Antonoff's ""oopsie,"" and more I can't even remember.

We are just living for *The Gay Of It All*. And I'd encourage you to do the same. I got lucky; my friend is also critical of Taylor's art and doesn't just worship her, taking her at face value. It's up to you to weigh whether your Swiftie friends are up for this experiment. Me, personally? I like people with open minds.

We're going to see the Eras Tour Movie again tomorrow. I'm *so* excited for the chance to react completely genuinely to it through my queer lens. It all started with *a question*: ""Do you think 'Tolerate It' might be about her dad?""

5114,"For those of you who also do your daily Google search for Taylor Swift, perhaps you’ve noticed Ellen coming up.

Just so you know, I’m gay, and I’ve always kinda looked up to Ellen. She’s one of the openly queer famous people (looking at you Taylor) that has been around advocating for a while.

Ellen came out in 1997, and Taylor first came on her show in 2008 for her Fearless album. She made a lot more appearances, but here are some highlights I would like to discuss.

2011-They talk seriously about how public her life is

Later 2011-The first of many “boy talks” to come

2012-Zac Efron joins her on the show

2013-Ellen made Taylor cry while asking about all the men she’s dated

2017-Actually, there weren’t any from the Reputation era

2019-The last appearance on Ellen, Ellen asked about her first kiss, who was Drew (even though she didn’t date the more famous Drew, but apparently there was another Drew)

Emily Ratajkowski recently posted something about Ellen harassing Taylor in that 2013 episode, and that’s why it’s been coming up.

I always thought Ellen knew Taylor was queer and was trying to break Taylor and get her to admit it. Don’t do this to anyone you know, peer pressuring someone into coming out is not good, if they’re not ready they’re not ready (totally not based off experience 🫠). Taylor and Ellen are (or once were) friends, but maybe Taylor never actually told Ellen, and Ellen just refused to believe that she was straight. (Is heterophobia a thing?) 

From a not Gaylor perspective, Ellen is really sexist toward Taylor. She doesn’t need a man to be famous, nothings wrong with her being single. She gets attacked for this a lot (Ginny and Georgia, 2015 Grammys, Ellen, her fans). And Ellen is standing by these EXTREMELY sexist comments and questions.

Gender roles, such as the ones Taylor has had to deal with, are a common theme of Midnights. She specifically addresses the marriage rumors and her not wanting marriage to get in the way of her success (notice how she doesn’t diminish the Gaylor theories tho…).

May seem out of pocket, but earlier today, I was watching Brooklyn 99. In one episode, a character (Terry for those of you who who have watched it) says “I am a feminist”, and “I want to pay for a sandwich with a $10 Ellen DeGeneres.” At first I thought it was a great feminist comment, but then I realized… Ellen isn’t a great feministic leader to look up to.

That’s what inspired me to write this post, but what are your opinions? On all of this, from Ellen to gender norms in Taylor’s music, and even all around in society. And do you think Taylor would appear on the Ellen show again?",https://www.reddit.com/r/GaylorSwift/comments/108kzzy/can_we_talk_about_ellen/,Can we talk about Ellen?,GaylorSwift,t3_108kzzy,/r/GaylorSwift/comments/108kzzy/can_we_talk_about_ellen/,2023-01-10 21:06:43,Taylor Swift,0.26859093,0.19717775,"Can we talk about Ellen?

5916,"I remember reading somewhere on the sub that the pandemic basically saved Taylor's career. Long story short, the redditor said that the force majeure circumstances had put an end to the messy Lover era. At first glance, it sounds pretty dramatic, but I can't help but think of all the possibilities and consider the what-if's. 

I remember that when she dropped the music video for The Man everyone was hyped up for something happening in May, The alleged ""The Man"" glittery letters which looked like ""This May"". Many thought that was basically an announcement of Cruel Summer as the next single. Lover Fest was coming, but later got postponed and eventually, cancelled.

IMO, Lover was not a bad era and actually I was becoming swiftie around that time so it's special for me, but she needed that break from everything - political matters, media, expectations and reviews. Plus, I am glad she succeeded in distancing herself from invasive attitudes through well developed fictional characters and stories with folklore and evermore. She reduced her team to just the people she wants to be surrounded with and since then she's been on a roll.

7916,"taylor is taking a 2 month break from touring between the march 9th singapore and may 9th paris shows. i’m going to coachella weekend 2 and im probably being delusional and wishful, but what are the odds she’d headline coachella this year? here’s some points that are making me think that it actually could be possible.

if there’s any festival taylor would play at this point in her career it would be coachella. given the massive success and high demand of this tour, midnights, her re-recordings, just the narrative of this entire era of her career is historic and uniquely iconic so the timing is right. coachella can definitely afford her as well. 

it’s very common for festival acts to also be on tour at the same time, festivals are often an added stops onto an artists tour. there’s so many times i’ve missed out on a concert in my city and was so bummed, only to end up seeing them anyway that summer at a festival. while a taylor coachella set would not be as simple as just a “stop” i do think that with access to a stage, set, crew, dancers, management etc while actively on tour they could be planning and early-stage rehearsing a separate show if they wanted to. 

question for y’all, has she ever done this with an award show performance while on tour? i assume so but i don’t actually have an example. 

ok so even if she didn’t plan a performance at all till the break, it would still be the correct amount of time to execute it. most of the recent headliners in the past, from what we can see on social media at least, start rehearsing for their coachella performances mid march. see ariana, black pink, lady gaga. (beyoncé did spend 8 months, but she had dropped out the year before bc she got pregnant and then dedicated that time to be her first major performance after pregnancy.)

what do you guys think? if anything maybe she’d at least attend coachella as a guest and we’d get to see some cute looks? #bleachella round 2? 😂",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/1561qv3/swiftchella_2024_maybe/,swiftchella 2024? maybe?,TaylorSwift,t3_1561qv3,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/1561qv3/swiftchella_2024_maybe/,2023-07-21 22:04:38,Taylor Swift,0.112643376,0.042036336,"swiftchella 2024? maybe? taylor is taking a 2 month break from touring between the march 9th singapore and may 9th paris shows. i’m going to coachella weekend 2 and im probably being delusional and wishful, but what are the odds she’d headline coachella this year? here’s some points that are making me think that it actually could be possible.

1423,"Taylor has been using Greco-Roman Mythology in her, especially in the more recent years. Let’s dive in. (This does not cover all instances of Greek Mythology, but the big ones. Pre-Midnights.)


Diana is the Roman goddess of the moon, childbirth, maidens, hunting, and nature. Her symbols are the moon, archery, boars, deer, bears, serpents, knives, and spears. Her Greek name is Artemis. Her twin is Apollo, god of healing, music, archery, oracles, herds, and the sun. His symbols are swans, ravens, wolves (also associated with Diana at times), laurels, and the monster Python. His name stayed the same in Rome, but he was sometimes called Phoebus Apollo. Phoebus means “golden, shining”.


Taylor has this theme of “twin flames”, that her and her Muse are true soulmates, each other’s other half. Also, Apollo is the good most closely associated with the 9 Muses.


Diana is the elder of the twins, she guided Apollo out during the labor and assisted their mother and the nymphs attending them in his childbirth.


Hecate is their first cousin through their mothers. She is the goddess of witchcraft, magic, crossroads, sometimes the moon, necromancy, and ghosts. Hecate’s symbols are dogs, paired torches, serpents, keys, daggers, and Hecate’s wheel which loosely resembles a labyrinth. Another plant sacred to Hecate is aconite, sometimes called wolf’s-bane. Wolves are associated with Diana, and if you’ve seen season 3 of You you’ll recognize aconite to be the drug someone was poisoned with WHILE EXILE FROM FOLKLORE PLAYED.




Hecate is also considered a Triple Goddess with Artemis/Diana and Selene/Luna (Titanness of the moon before Artemis rose to power). Respectively they represented the hunt, the moon, and the underworld. Sometimes Hecate was considered a triple goddess by herself, and she held all three domains listed above. How many witch covers of Willow did we get? That’s right, 3….Willows are associated with Dianna as a Willow featured in the music video for Begin Again. Dianna is a fan of macabre stuff like skulls, cemeteries, ghosts, death. Taylor mentions witches and makes allusions to magic a bit.


I also want to touch on the myth of Theseus and Ariadne. Theseus volunteered to go into the Labyrinth on the island of Crete and slay the Minotaur, a monster that is half man, half bull. He is assisted in this task by Ariadne, the half-sister (don’t ask) of said monster. Her name means “holy”. Diana comes from two possible sources, a word meaning “daylight, shining” or a word meaning “holy, divine”. Ariadne helped guide Theseus through the Labyrinth by giving him a spool of thread, described as either gold or red, that he used in the maze so he would know the way out. After his victory Ariadne left Crete with him, but they stopped and napped on another island. During the nap Dionysus came to Theseus in a dream and told him to leave Ariadne behind on the beach. (Some sources say Athena did this because she felt Ariadne was too much of a distraction to him.) Some versions of the myth have Nemesis, the goddess of revenge, appearing to Ariadne and pointing the ship that was sailing away, telling her how Theseus abandoned her. Theseus was supposed to change the sails on the ship from black to white on his return to his fathers kingdom, to let him know he survived victorious, but forgot. His father flung himself into the sea when he saw the black sails, believing his son to be dead.


East Asian mythology talks about how a red thread is tied around the wrists/fingers of soulmates destined to find each other and be together.


Dianna is a Taurus in the western zodiac, and is a fire tiger in the Chinese one. Taylor is a Sagittarius and an earth snake. Taurus is an earth sign and Sagittarius is a fire sign, and no I didn’t make that up. They actually matched each others elements, lmfao. At Dianna’s 26 birthday party Taylor threw her Dianna carried a stuffed snake around and Taylor dressed as a tiger. The party was circus-themed, remember this.


Apollo was associated with laurel crowns, much like the one worn by one of the ghosts in the Anti-Hero mv. He pursued a water nymph named Daphne, she ran from him as she did not return his feelings. Once her feet hit the river she was turned into a laurel tree. Apollo cut off some branches and fashioned himself a crown from them, and his followers would give laurel crowns to people who won’t athletic games, as well as talented poets and artists. (I also want to point out the laurel crown ghost is wearing heart eye sunglasses, a Swiftgron/Red symbol. The other two are wearing a cowboy hat and a cat ear headband with what looks to be sunglasses adorned with small daisies, both of these reference link to Swiftgron songs. Karlie is NOT in this video, the reference of 3 is common in Greek mythology—see below.)



Diana statue Taylor mimicked in OOTW music video, statue is located in Paris. Shoutout to u/alex-chaser for catching this one.




There is a statue of the goddess Diana in the mv for Delicate.



The MANY references to water, waves, oceans, and storms in her discography. This references how the moon controls the tides, but could also be a reference to Poseidon, the god of the sea.


Taylor also has referenced ships in her work. The Odyssey featured ships and voyages prominently. In it, Odysseus/Ulysses has been away fighting in the Trojan war for a decade, covered in the Iliad. It takes him another decade to return to his kingdom and his wife, Penelope, who had remained faithful to him that whole time. Unfortunately many suitors bothered her and wished to marry her. She is able to delay them for three years by claiming she will wed once the burial shroud she is weaving for her father-in-law is finished. Secretly she undies her progress every night, until a slave tells the suitors. She then claims whosoever can string the string Odysseus’ bow will win the contest for her hand. Only Odysseus can, and he then slaughters all the suitors and reveals himself to his beloved. Penelope, unsure it’s him and not a god in disguise to test her fidelity, loudly orders her servant to move the bed in their room. Odysseus protests it cannot be done as he made the bed himself and one leg is fashioned out of a living olive tree. She finally believes he is indeed her husband, which demonstrates their homophrosýnē, a word meaning “like-mindedness”. (Taylor paints her and her Muse as twin flames, soulmates.)



Ships also feature in the myth of Jason and the Argonauts. Dianna’s younger brother is named Jason. (Further connecting her and Taylor as twin flames is the fact both of them have younger brothers, and both of their sets of parents are divorced.) Jason and many men, plus a woman, Atalanta, journey to get the Golden Fleece. This story has a pretty tragic ending, so I won’t go into detail. 


Speaking of Atalanta, she was a famous tomboy who didn’t want to marry. Her symbols are golden apples, bears, and lions. Taymojis include an apple and multiple lions. Dianna, while not born in Atlanta, was born in Georgia, the state Atlanta is in.

I keep referencing twin flames, and there is a Greek myth about soulmates. In addition to the myth at the end of this post, the soulmates myth is one of my favorites. Everyone was born as one half of a couple. Men paired with men were said to come from the Sun, women with women from the Earth, and het couples from the moon. Zeus was afraid they were too powerful and a threat to the gods, so he split them in two, damning everyone to spend their lives searching for their other half. This myth views couples as a complete set, they are so alike because they are true soulmates.




Taylor mentions a scorpion stinging in mad woman, notably a scorpion stung and killed Orion, who was a hunting companion of Artemis.


Golden string in Cardigan and Willow, calls back to the alleged gold thread Ariadne—whose name means “holy, divine” like Diana allegedly does—gave to Theseus—a son of Poseidon—to guide him through the Labyrinth.


Achilles heel in State of Grace. Also, she mentions “grace” and “fate” in this song, there were 3 Graces and 3 Fates in Greco-Roman mythology. The Graces attended Aphrodite, the goddess of love, when she was born from the sea, while the Fates measured and cut the string of life for each individual.


Triples are a thing in GR mythology. In addition to the 3 Graces and Fates, there were triple goddesses. As discussed in my Taymoji post, Artemis/Diana, Selene/Luna, and Hecate/Trivia were the grouping that made the triple goddesses. Hecate, being the goddess of magic, is someone I believe Taylor has alluded to. She released 3 remixes of Willow, titled dancing witch, moonlit with, lonely witch. Dancing can be associated with the 9 Muses, and moonlit obviously to Diana and Luna. Also want to show that the capitalized letters in the quotation marks can be rearranged to say “HY DIANNA U R BETTY”. There wasn’t a second E in the quote to fully spell out hey.


Using “Muse” in The Lakes. Muses are women, there are nine of them. They are closely associated with Apollo and the arts.


Random af deer in the mv for Blank Space. Deer are associated with Artemis/Diana.


The MANY moon Taymojis, and references to Greco-Roman mythology in them. See my previous posts.


Taylor posted images of palm trees in the lead up to Lover. Palm trees are a symbol of the goddess Diana.


The entirety of the song The Archer. The whole damn thing, Diana is the goddess of the hunt and uses a bow and arrow.


People shooting a bow and arrow appear in the mvs for YNTCD and Anti-Hero.


Taylor references the Garden of Babylon in CLM, a Dianna song. The Garden of Babylon was one of the Seven Wonders of the world. Another was Diana’s temple at Ephesus.


A nymph and follower of Diana, Callisto, attracted the attention of Zeus and was either seduced or r\*ped, depending on who tells the myth. Diana, furious that the nymph had been defiled/broke her vow of chastity, turned her into a Bear. Some version of the myth have Zeus disguising himself as his daughter Diana when he tried to seduce Callisto. Taylor once posted a pic of herself on Instagram in a bear costume.


This next one is probably a total reach, but it is about my favorite myth. I’ve been wanting her to reference it for FOREVER, so Taylor, if you read this, please reference Eros and Psyche, I’m begging you. I will get down on my knees and beg you , it is my favorite myth and I love it so much.
“Your faithless loves the only hoax I believe in.”Psyche was a beautiful mortal everyone compared Aphrodite to. Aphrodite, being a vain goddess, became enraged and ordered her son, Eros, to shoot Psyche with his arrows and make her fall in love with someone hideous. He accidentally pierced himself with the love arrow, and came to love Psyche. He brought her to an abandoned castle and would visit her at nighttime, never allowing her to see what he looked like. Psyche grew curious and one night lit a candle to get a look at him. The wax from the candle dropped into him, waking him up. He was disappointed she had no faith in him. He flees and runs to his mother, who makes Psyche complete four difficult tasks in order to be able to be with her son. Eros is the good of love, and Psyche became goddess of the soul. Taylor has a big thing for soulmates and twin flames/true love.

How many witch covers of Willow did we get? That’s right, 3….Willows are associated with Dianna as a Willow featured in the music video for Begin Again. Dianna is a fan of macabre stuff like skulls, cemeteries, ghosts, death. Taylor mentions witches and makes allusions to magic a bit.


I also want to touch on the myth of Theseus and Ariadne. Theseus volunteered to go into the Labyrinth on the island of Crete and slay the Minotaur, a monster that is half man, half bull. He is assisted in this task by Ariadne, the half-sister (don’t ask) of said monster. Her name means “holy”. Diana comes from two possible sources, a word meaning “daylight, shining” or a word meaning “holy, divine”. Ariadne helped guide Theseus through the Labyrinth by giving him a spool of thread, described as either gold or red, that he used in the maze so he would know the way out. After his victory Ariadne left Crete with him, but they stopped and napped on another island. During the nap Dionysus came to Theseus in a dream and told him to leave Ariadne behind on the beach. (Some sources say Athena did this because she felt Ariadne was too much of a distraction to him.) Some versions of the myth have Nemesis, the goddess of revenge, appearing to Ariadne and pointing the ship that was sailing away, telling her how Theseus abandoned her. Theseus was supposed to change the sails on the ship from black to white on his return to his fathers kingdom, to let him know he survived victorious, but forgot. His father flung himself into the sea when he saw the black sails, believing his son to be dead.


East Asian mythology talks about how a red thread is tied around the wrists/fingers of soulmates destined to find each other and be together.


Dianna is a Taurus in the western zodiac, and is a fire tiger in the Chinese one. Taylor is a Sagittarius and an earth snake. Taurus is an earth sign and Sagittarius is a fire sign, and no I didn’t make that up. They actually matched each others elements, lmfao. At Dianna’s 26 birthday party Taylor threw her Dianna carried a stuffed snake around and Taylor dressed as a tiger. The party was circus-themed, remember this.


Apollo was associated with laurel crowns, much like the one worn by one of the ghosts in the Anti-Hero mv. He pursued a water nymph named Daphne, she ran from him as she did not return his feelings. Once her feet hit the river she was turned into a laurel tree. Apollo cut off some branches and fashioned himself a crown from them, and his followers would give laurel crowns to people who won’t athletic games, as well as talented poets and artists. (I also want to point out the laurel crown ghost is wearing heart eye sunglasses, a Swiftgron/Red symbol. The other two are wearing a cowboy hat and a cat ear headband with what looks to be sunglasses adorned with small daisies, both of these reference link to Swiftgron songs. Karlie is NOT in this video, the reference of 3 is common in Greek mythology—see below.)



Diana statue Taylor mimicked in OOTW music video, statue is located in Paris. Shoutout to u/alex-chaser for catching this one.




There is a statue of the goddess Diana in the mv for Delicate.



The MANY references to water, waves, oceans, and storms in her discography. This references how the moon controls the tides, but could also be a reference to Poseidon, the god of the sea.


Taylor also has referenced ships in her work. The Odyssey featured ships and voyages prominently. In it, Odysseus/Ulysses has been away fighting in the Trojan war for a decade, covered in the Iliad. It takes him another decade to return to his kingdom and his wife, Penelope, who had remained faithful to him that whole time. Unfortunately many suitors bothered her and wished to marry her. She is able to delay them for three years by claiming she will wed once the burial shroud she is weaving for her father-in-law is finished. Secretly she undies her progress every night, until a slave tells the suitors. She then claims whosoever can string the string Odysseus’ bow will win the contest for her hand. Only Odysseus can, and he then slaughters all the suitors and reveals himself to his beloved. Penelope, unsure it’s him and not a god in disguise to test her fidelity, loudly orders her servant to move the bed in their room. Odysseus protests it cannot be done as he made the bed himself and one leg is fashioned out of a living olive tree. She finally believes he is indeed her husband, which demonstrates their homophrosýnē, a word meaning “like-mindedness”. (Taylor paints her and her Muse as twin flames, soulmates.)



Ships also feature in the myth of Jason and the Argonauts. Dianna’s younger brother is named Jason. (Further connecting her and Taylor as twin flames is the fact both of them have younger brothers, and both of their sets of parents are divorced.) Jason and many men, plus a woman, Atalanta, journey to get the Golden Fleece. This story has a pretty tragic ending, so I won’t go into detail. 


Speaking of Atalanta, she was a famous tomboy who didn’t want to marry. Her symbols are golden apples, bears, and lions. Taymojis include an apple and multiple lions. Dianna, while not born in Atlanta, was born in Georgia, the state Atlanta is in.

I keep referencing twin flames, and there is a Greek myth about soulmates. In addition to the myth at the end of this post, the soulmates myth is one of my favorites. Everyone was born as one half of a couple. Men paired with men were said to come from the Sun, women with women from the Earth, and het couples from the moon. Zeus was afraid they were too powerful and a threat to the gods, so he split them in two, damning everyone to spend their lives searching for their other half. This myth views couples as a complete set, they are so alike because they are true soulmates.




Taylor mentions a scorpion stinging in mad woman, notably a scorpion stung and killed Orion, who was a hunting companion of Artemis.


Golden string in Cardigan and Willow, calls back to the alleged gold thread Ariadne—whose name means “holy, divine” like Diana allegedly does—gave to Theseus—a son of Poseidon—to guide him through the Labyrinth.


Achilles heel in State of Grace. Also, she mentions “grace” and “fate” in this song, there were 3 Graces and 3 Fates in Greco-Roman mythology. The Graces attended Aphrodite, the goddess of love, when she was born from the sea, while the Fates measured and cut the string of life for each individual.


Triples are a thing in GR mythology. In addition to the 3 Graces and Fates, there were triple goddesses. As discussed in my Taymoji post, Artemis/Diana, Selene/Luna, and Hecate/Trivia were the grouping that made the triple goddesses. Hecate, being the goddess of magic, is someone I believe Taylor has alluded to. She released 3 remixes of Willow, titled dancing witch, moonlit with, lonely witch. Dancing can be associated with the 9 Muses, and moonlit obviously to Diana and Luna. Also want to show that the capitalized letters in the quotation marks can be rearranged to say “HY DIANNA U R BETTY”. There wasn’t a second E in the quote to fully spell out hey.


Using “Muse” in The Lakes. Muses are women, there are nine of them. They are closely associated with Apollo and the arts.


Random af deer in the mv for Blank Space. Deer are associated with Artemis/Diana.


The MANY moon Taymojis, and references to Greco-Roman mythology in them. See my previous posts.


Taylor posted images of palm trees in the lead up to Lover. Palm trees are a symbol of the goddess Diana.


The entirety of the song The Archer. The whole damn thing, Diana is the goddess of the hunt and uses a bow and arrow.


People shooting a bow and arrow appear in the mvs for YNTCD and Anti-Hero.


Taylor references the Garden of Babylon in CLM, a Dianna song. The Garden of Babylon was one of the Seven Wonders of the world. Another was Diana’s temple at Ephesus.


A nymph and follower of Diana, Callisto, attracted the attention of Zeus and was either seduced or r\*ped, depending on who tells the myth. Diana, furious that the nymph had been defiled/broke her vow of chastity, turned her into a Bear. Some version of the myth have Zeus disguising himself as his daughter Diana when he tried to seduce Callisto. Taylor once posted a pic of herself on Instagram in a bear costume.


This next one is probably a total reach, but it is about my favorite myth. I’ve been wanting her to reference it for FOREVER, so Taylor, if you read this, please reference Eros and Psyche, I’m begging you. I will get down on my knees and beg you , it is my favorite myth and I love it so much.
“Your faithless loves the only hoax I believe in.”Psyche was a beautiful mortal everyone compared Aphrodite to. Aphrodite, being a vain goddess, became enraged and ordered her son, Eros, to shoot Psyche with his arrows and make her fall in love with someone hideous. He accidentally pierced himself with the love arrow, and came to love Psyche. He brought her to an abandoned castle and would visit her at nighttime, never allowing her to see what he looked like. Psyche grew curious and one night lit a candle to get a look at him. The wax from the candle dropped into him, waking him up. He was disappointed she had no faith in him. He flees and runs to his mother, who makes Psyche complete four difficult tasks in order to be able to be with her son. Eros is the good of love, and Psyche became goddess of the soul. Taylor has a big thing for soulmates and twin flames/true love.

&#x200B;

**ISO:**

All ISO related posts should be commented in this megathread from now on. *Individual ISO posts will be removed.*

&#x200B;

**SELLING & TRADING:**

Please review the [selling]( & [trading]( rules before commenting. As a reminder, your Reddit account should be at least one month old if you want to sell or trade.

The *basic* rules are (but PLEASE review the full rules):

* **You MUST upload a photo of the items you are trading or selling** \- No stock images or images that are not yours. You can upload images to Imgur and share the link in a comment on this post. **THIS ALSO APPLIES TO TRADE OFFERS. Comment with a photo of your item you are offering to trade before private messaging.**
   * Any very RARE items should have a photo with a handwritten timestamp (your Reddit username and the date handwritten on a piece of paper).
   * i.e. ""Record Store Days"" Vinyl Records, 'Lover' Snow Globe, Signed Items, and Lithographs
* If you are interested in a sale or trade, comment ""Sent a private message to you. I accept your listed price or I have X item to trade"" so the moderator(s) know who is reaching out to who.
* No ""Taking offers"" comments - **Items being sold must have a clear price**. If anyone tries to sell something to you ABOVE their listed price - please let the moderators know.
   * If you want to negotiate a lower price or offer something else that is not an ISO, please do so in the comments first.
   * Insane price gouging is not allowed.
   * If you are unsure about the value of an item, feel free to make a post with the ""Fair Trade/Value Question"" flair.
* ***Please edit your comment once you've accepted an offer and tag the user you are selling or trading to.***

This line defines the message in If This Was A Movie. Taylor begs her ex to return to her in this ballad, but she will not take them back if they don’t apologize. Missing someone who broke your heart can be confusing. Taylor shows maturity by holding this boundary and telling the muse that there are expectations if they do come back. Although she pleads them to return, coming back is not enough, they must also apologize.


An example of how boundaries can leave you lonely at times, but you shouldn’t forget about them in desperation for companionship. Taylor can’t accept a wordless return from this person, even though she wants to, because she knows that if this person isn’t sorry, their issues are going to repeat themselves.

29329,"I've seen a few comments on here expressing confusion for Bejeweled being considered sad or dark. Someone on Tumblr also called it word salad and basically implied Taylor had no discernible meaning or intention with the song (!!!!)

So I'm here to clear that up!

*Baby love, I think I've been a little too kind*

\[The opening line presents a contrast: an affectionate pet name followed by a scathing remark. The person she's speaking to is someone she loves but isn't feeling good about anymore. How does one be ""too"" kind? Generally when they feel used or walked over.\]

*Didn't notice you walking all over my peace of mind*

\[Peace of mind is a calm, assured state of being. Taylor has realised being ""too kind"" led this person to feel entitled to walk all over her\]

*In the shoes I gave you as a present!*

\[This is an interesting way to ""personify"" someone's negative affect on you. They can't literally walk on your state of being. But they can make you upset and treat you poorly, even though you give them nice gifts!\]

*Puttin' someone first only works when you're in their top five*

\[She gives her reason for being ""too kind"". She made them THE only priority. Even though she is in no way their priority\]

*And by the way, I'm going out tonight.*

\[She's no longer going to stay home for someone who makes her feel mistreated\]

*Best believe I'm still bejeweled when I walk in the room, I can still make the whole place shimmer*

\[The term ""best believe"" is often said to mean ""you better believe this"". She's letting the neglectful person know that just because she's unhappy at home, that doesn't mean they've dampened her shine\]

*And when I meet the band, they ask, ""Do you have a man?"" I can still say, ""I don't remember""*

\[She becomes a little more devious, letting this person (who we now know is her man) know that if other men show her attention, she can just as easily tell those guys ""Well...I never see him and he makes me unhappy so...""\]

*Familiarity breeds contempt*

\[This is a common phrase to mean the longer you know someone, the bigger chance you have of finding negative things you dislike about them, opposite to ""absence makes the heart grow fonder"". Their relationship has soured and made them dislike each other over time\]

*Don't put me in the basement when I want the penthouse of your heart*

\[The basement is the lowest possible point of a house, cold and dark, whereas a penthouse is luxurious, spacious and comfortable. Another clever way of asking him to treat her better and to open his heart to her\]

*Diamonds in my eyes, I polish up real, I polish up real nice*

\[It's my theory that 'diamonds in my eyes' represent tears. There are diamonds in tear shapes under her eyes in the music video too. Polishing up means once you get dressed up, you look incredible. More than people might expect. Or maybe more than a neglectful partner cares to remember. She could even be looking in the mirror after getting dressed up and tearing up at how long its been since she felt good about herself\]

*Baby boy, I think I've been too good of a girl (too good of a girl)*

\[She feels she needs to do something to change things up, remind him of what he's losing\]

*Did all the extra credit, then got graded on a curve*

\[Being graded on a curve means scores are adjusted after a test/assignment. This raises the average and individual grades/scores. Her point is that she went above and beyond for this person yet does not receive appropriate acknowledgement for it, nor does she receive her full/original ""score"". To remove all metaphors, she is doing all the work to keep the relationship alive and he is doing nothing but still considers it an equal effort\]

*I think it's time to teach some lessons*

\[Continuing with the grade/score metaphor and the ""good girl"" theme, she is once again expressing that she is making a move of sorts to show him what he's doing wrong\]

*I made you my world, have you heard? I can reclaim the land*

\[If he is her whole world, she can take it back. Again without the metaphor, if he was all she focused on, and it was for nothing, she can refocus and start putting herself first once more.\]

*And I miss you, but I miss sparkling* 

\[As with the terms ""baby love/boy"", giving him presents, staying home, putting in all the effort - the ""I miss you"" lament here is that, despite all the contempt, poor treatment and bitterness - she still yearns for him. She'd like him to come back. But she also misses who she was before. She might wish he came home more, but she also greatly misses being able to go out and mingle/shine/dress up/be at her best. Of course, a healthy relationship would still allow her to shine\].

*Sapphire tears on my face, sadness became my whole sky*

\[Continuing both the 'diamonds in my eyes' and 'I made you my world' theme. If the person you made your only priority is also the person who makes you sad, then everything, even the sky, is going to seem sad\]

*But some guy said my aura's moonstone just 'cause he was high*

\[The gemstone theme continues as she reveals a man said something to her that made her feel some kinda way. What he said was seemingly nonsensical because of his intoxicated state but let's think about what it could mean. Your aura is ""the distinctive atmosphere or quality that surrounds/is generated by a person"" and moonstone generally signifies ""hope, sensitivity, abundance and feminine energy"". So this man she met when she decided to go out got a better idea of her in one meeting than the neglectful boyfriend wouldn't even care to notice. And yes, perhaps this guy was just talking nonsense because he was high, but her point is this is all it would take for her to move on from neglectful bf who gives nothing, because she misses sparkling both within herself AND in someone else's eyes. If you don't make your partner feel special...someone else will!\]

*And we're dancin' all night and you can try to change my mind, but you might have to wait in line*

\[She throws him one last flicker of hope, but lets him know just how quickly she can stop prioritising him too. At the beginning, she was still putting him first, now there's several people ahead of him after one outing. This is exactly why she need not stay home being neglected - she's a catch!

*What's a girl gonna do? A diamond's gotta shine!*

\[Case in point. I think the ""what's a girl gonna do"" refrain is delightfully snide because she's basically shrugging and saying ""Well, if I'm hot, then I'm hot. Your loss, buddy!""\]

Now, the music video. Opening on a mistreated ""wench"" banished to the house (quite literally in the basement) being verbally assaulted by her keepers. A nasty but revealing comment: ""The prince would never have anything to do with that harlot **again**, he tired of her quite quickly, didn't he?"". The wench once fraternized with royalty and has fallen from high social status.  When the keepers finally leave, the wench reveals a hidden talent for dressmaking. She has no space where this talent can be seen and appreciated. When the keepers mentioned a talent show at the ball would lead to legitimate ownership of a castle, she decides this is her chance. As we know, the magic elevator buttons each correspond to an album. She stops by the Speak Now room to find a room full of jewels. The lines ""I made you my world, have you heard? I can reclaim the land"" become neatly reappropriated to represent her re-recordings. She moves to the 1989 room for a lesson in burlesque striptease with Dita Von Teese. She chose the era in which she was dating Calvin to do this. This lesson (""I think it's time to teach some lessons!"") represents when she changed her image, presented as a little sexier/mature overall. The 1989 era was simultaneously when she realised the extent of her talent/power, but also began dating someone who would come to diminish/undermine it. Taylor performs at the talent show (on the 13th floor no less, which would be the SN re-record room...) having designed her own costume and learned how to dance. She chooses not to marry ""the prince"" (the ideal, coveted option that everyone would expect her to marry), ghosts him (and he just shrugs!) but manages to retain her power/ownership of the castle. To put it bluntly, I think Calvin is represented by the keepers, I think the mother's snide comment is 2016 in a nutshell, I think the prince represents stereotypical couple/marriage goals and expectations, the jewels are obviously her albums and the castle is her career or legacy.   


I think despite the song being very much about what attention and affection means both in and out of a relationship, the video was designed to swerve away from visualising those themes (thus avoiding any controversy/headlines) and was more about reclaiming herself and her legacy in the wake of the music catalogue fallout.

31751,"Every so often I see a post talking about Swifties acting weird, entitled, being gatekeepy. And almost every time the user says, ""I usually see this on Twitter and Tiktok.""

A bit of advice: Don't engage with Swifties on Tiktok and Twitter. I'm not saying there aren't good people on there, there are. But in my experience, it is not worth it to sift through all the bullshit behavior just to find a few fun users. Twitter and TikTok Swifties are not accurate representations of the fandom.

**Let me say it louder: Twitter and TikTok Swifties are NOT accurate representations of the fandom.**

With how often we consume social media on a regular basis, it can feel like what we see online is what is happening in the world around us. But really, social media often distorts reality. Even this subreddit isn't entirely an accurate view of all Taylor Swift fans, and I would say it's one of the better platforms to actually discuss Taylor and her artistry, as well as engage with people who are somewhat normal and more well-adjusted.

Twitter and TikTok contribute to horrible behavior and horrible habits. Even over the weekend when fans were (rightfully) upset about all the people showing up at the rehearsal dinner restaurant on LBI, there were users saying things like ""Taylor would HATE you for showing up!"" 

Even ""fans"" who are trying to ""defend"" Taylor for something that is a bit frustrating, are using hateful language and being incredibly aggressive and rude. 

The average Swiftie isn't like this. I'm about to leave my current job of three years and in the past 6 months I have discovered 3 (undercover Swifties as I like to call them) coworkers who are Taylor fans who are just living their lives enjoying her music. One of them is a mom in her early thirties, another is single and loves to garden and reputation is her favorite album, another works from home, and happens to be from my home state, and she loves Red. And they all just love Taylor's music and they aren't concerned with the crazy fans on Twitter and Tiktok.

Even more recent, I found out that the baristas at the cafe at my work are also major Swifties. All three of them. And they just pre-ordered the Sunrise Boulevard vinyl for 1989 TV. We've now been talking about Taylor for the past month, and I had no idea they were such major fans.

These are the normal Swifties. These experiences **are** accurate representations of the fandom. Please don't get yourself down by consuming so much TikTok and Twitter that you forget that we are just normal people who love Taylor's music. There are just some crazies who have too much time on their hands. Unplug from that noise. The fandom is amazing.

People will start lining a few hours before the store opens. Some people even line up day before. With that being said, RSD is an international celebration for vinyl collectors, NOT EVERYBODY IS THERE FOR TAYLOR.

[Click here for a list of stores participating.](https://recordstoreday.com/stores) There are 75,000 (in the US) & 40,000 (international) pressings of the long pond sessions vinyl, so hopefully there should be a better chance of people getting this vinyl compared to the lakes.

Some stores might go into a ""lottery system"" for the vinyl as thats the only ""fair"" way to let everybody have a chance at the vinyl.

I am not an avid fan, more so a casual listener but I’m really excited to take my mom and aunts and let them bask in it all! Because of that, I need some of y’all real Swifties to clue me in so I can make sure this is unforgettable for them. 

I already got them going with their outfits (my mom is doing Lover and I’m giving her kandi to trade at the concert cause tbh I just want girls to compliment her!!) but my ladies are very concerned about the shoe situation. For anyone who wore a ~cute~ shoe with a little boot or heel or something- did you regret it? Is it better to just opt for a less cute and more comfortable shoe? 

Another major concern- and please don’t drag us- my mom and aunts are planning on napping and eating through the openers to be able to make it through Taylor’s whole set. Because of this, my mom and I are a little concerned about being able to get good merch. I want to be able to get some good stuff for my Swiftie friends who actually deserve to be there and not some stupid tote bag lol. So with that being said- do things sell out quickly? Are we totally screwed getting there as late as planned?

And last but not least- the chants. I want them to feel like they’re apart of the whole thing, so is there any little crowd moments like that one LGB chant that I can tell them about? Any little inside jokes or Swift lore I can clue them into that might be relevant?

A Scott Borchetta redemption, which would be him buying her Masters back and just selling them to her with no strings attached at a low price. He'd take a major loss but it would be like Darth Vader going against everything he had done previously with a change of heart motivated by ""family"".

5853,"After my first listen of Midnights, it was obvious Would've Could've Should've was the standout. Not only does the song provide something I feel Midnights lacks, but it is (IMO) the most vulnerable we've seen Taylor, arguably, since Red. The religious imagery, unabating production, soaring chorus, and soul crushing bridge have easily placed this song as one of my all time favorites. In the discourse surrounding WCS, it is widely agreed upon the song is referencing the relationship that inspired Dear John, where there was a glaring age gap and hence power imbalance. This song however, provides a different perspective on the relationship, focusing on the long term emotional damage that can arise from traumatic relationships while young. In addition, the religious imagery throughout the song alludes to her loss of faith, arguably in both a literal and metaphorical sense. In Fearless, Debut, and the Christmas album there were clear references to Christian faith, whether that was performative for country music audiences or not, it is worth noting that post-Fearless this disappears. But there is also a sense, that the relationship makes Taylor lose her faith in another way, the relationship changes something intrinsic about her, to where she explicitly repeats, ""I miss who I used to be. And By the height of the bridge, she simply yet decisively announces, ""Give me back my girlhood, it was mine first,""- a thesis statement for the song and arguably the entire speak now album. 

Taylor was 20 when Speak Now came out, and it is clear throughout the album she is navigating the transition from girlhood to adulthood. One of the best examples of this tension, was the naming of the album- Taylor initially chose Enchanted as the title and after being told it was too fairytale-y/youthful, came back with the title Speak Now. Songs like Enchanted, Mine, Sparks Fly, and Speak Now are arguably the last moments in Taylor's discography where she sings about the wistful, hopelessly romantic and youthful tropes she had, up until that point, crafted her lyrical ideology upon (Maybe besides Stay, Stay Stay...) . These songs sit in contention with the darker, more mature, and somewhat frantic songs on this album, like Dear John, The Story of Us, Haunted, and Back to December. In the middle of this tension sits Never Grow Up, a song where Taylor begs her little brother to, like the name suggests, never grow up.  However the song is undeniably self reflective, and after the bridge she flips it back to herself, admitting, ""I wish I'd never grown up, I don't want to grow up, It could still be simple.""Here she is lamenting to her younger brother the dark realities that can come with growing up and wishing she could hold on to her “girlhood” a little bit longer. If Never Grow Up was written after the traumatic relationship described in this album, it fits perfectly with the themes in Would've Could've Should've. In WCS she laments the loss of her girlhood and with it the (arguably) innocent perception of love and relationships she had up until that point. I think with the added context WCS provides regarding the way this relationship changed her, we are able to listen to Speak Now and
Never Grow Up with a new lens.

We got the 4 variants, the Eras Movie which solely on AMC made $26M dollars in presales in the first 24 hours which **excludes the other cinemas**. And in addition, let's remember that the movie will not be exclusively available only on October 13th, but for a few weeks which will maintain the hype until 27th of October.

I am sure she has many videos and events in her sleeve. I imagine the week after 1989 TV's release will be filled with surprise announcements, music video drops and new variants with exclusive songs. A musically eventful week Midnights style.

With all that in mind, I believe 1989 TV can surpass first 1989 OG and second even Midnights. 

My second guess, which I find more realistic, is that the sales will be approximated to those of Midnights' first week sales.

My third guess is that 1989 TV will bring an avalanche of TS albums reentering Billboard 200's top 10 and that even 1989 OG will chart inside it.

# Wrapping up

I knew this era's performances reflected the masters heist but I hadn't realized how obvious the demarcation was. Mid June, Taylor's at the Stonewall Inn and releasing You Need to Calm Down with a cadre of friends. 

Then the master heist was announced June 30th, the Archer promo single was dropped, and the performances and outfits took a more somber turn.

We're more than halfway through the rerecords, which are obviously a smash hit that have pushed Taylor to a new peak in popularity and stardom. 

But 2019 was a rough ride, and the Lover era had already been changed before it was officially cut short.

And I do think it's significant that we moved through the greys of folklore, the sepias of evermore, and that we're still in the dark blue skies of Midnights. 

Will we see daylight soon?

""Once upon a time the planets and the fates and all the stars aligned""

She first begins by describing a form of pre-determinism, but we know from the Karma music video that she MOVES planets herself, which means that her usage of these idioms is still self-indulgent in her scheming ways.

29700,"A few days ago, someone made [a thread about pairing Taylor Swift songs with songs from other artists](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/131cch4/pair_your_favorite_taylor_song_with_a_nontaylor/). As I made my list, I realized how similar the album *Red* is to another pop-rock album, *Gutterflower* by the Goo Goo Dolls. I knew the vibes were similar, but went down the track lists and found so many potential song pairings that it was really remarkable when I dug into it. So, I decided to write a longer post about why I feel these albums are spiritual cousins, and perhaps allow us to understand *Red* better by looking at an album that's similar in many ways.

**Background**

As any Swiftie knows, the album *Red* is about the various messy, intense, ""semi-toxic"" relationships Swift had between 2010–2012. She has described it as her only true break-up album, and one where she wanted to experiment with as many different musical styles and collaborators as she could. It contains banging country anthems, heartbreaking acoustic ballads, fun dance pop, and everything in between.

[*Gutterflower*](https://open.spotify.com/album/740t2GhGBLY6qIPRNhSo9M?si=iraT6XHRS6-Hkyv2dSGv8w) was released by Buffalo-based rock band the Goo Goo Dolls in 2002. They had spent the late '80s and early '90s as a garage-punk band, touring around in a van and playing small clubs. Then two albums, *A Boy Named Goo* (1995) and *Dizzy Up the Girl* (1998), saw massive success propelled by the hits ""Name"" and ""Iris."" Following this, their frontman Johnny Rzeznik saw the breakdown of his marriage. *Gutterflower* is sometimes bright and sometimes dark, sonically and lyrically, with many break-up songs. In my opinion, it has some of the Goos' all-time best songwriting.

Now I'm going to pair specific tracks from each album and talk about the parallels between them, to hopefully illustrate why I think these albums are similar. These pairs of songs aren't necessarily sonic cousins, but related in lyrics and themes.

**State Of Grace vs. Big Machine**

>*And I never saw you coming*  
>  
>*And I'll never be the same*

&#x200B;

>*I'm torn in pieces*  
>  
>*I'm blind and waiting for*  
>  
>*My heart is reeling*  
>  
>*I'm blind and waiting for you*

Both albums open with a stadium-friendly rocker. State Of Grace is a little more atmospheric, while Big Machine (ignore the irony of that title in a TS post) is as loud and explosive as can be. Both are about the emotional highs and risks of falling in love, setting the tone for their respective albums.

**I Bet You Think About Me vs. Think About Me**

>*Do you have all the space that you need?*  
>  
>*I don't have to be your shrink to know*  
>  
>*That you'll never be happy*  
>  
>*And I bet you think about me*

&#x200B;

>*Oh, but you take it so slowly*  
>  
>*And your eyes, they look so lonely*  
>  
>*But it's only when you think about me*

It's right there in the titles. These songs explore the feeling of knowing your ex is still thinking of you, with different tones. This is one of the few Goo songs where we know who it's about, as John used to subtly comment on it before playing it at concerts. Of course, with the details Taylor includes, there's no doubt who she's dissing here. Her approach is very sarcastic, taking jabs at her ex, while the Goos' is sympathetic to how Rzeznik's ex must be struggling without him.

**The Last Time vs. Here Is Gone**

>*This is the last time I'm asking you this*    
>  
>*Put my name at the top of your list*    
>  
>*This is the last time I'm asking you why*    
>  
>*You break my heart in the blink of an eye*

&#x200B;

>*And I want to get free, talk to me*     
>  
>*I can feel you falling*    
>  
>*And I wanted to be all you need*    
>  
>*Somehow, here is gone*

Though Here Is Gone isn't a duet, you can interpret the lyrics to come from both sides. It was probably the best known single from *Gutterflower*. These two acoustic pop-rock tunes convey the desperation of feeling the relationship falling apart, and the breakdown of communication between the singers and their partners.

**The Lucky One vs. What A Scene**

>*And they tell you that you're lucky, but you're so confused*  
>  
>*'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used*  
>  
>*And all the young things line up to take your place*  
>  
>*Another name goes up in lights*  
>  
>*You wonder if you'll make it out alive*

&#x200B;

>*And when you're looking for truth on the cover of a magazine*  
>  
>*How does it feel?*    
>  
>*When you found out what you're not gonna be, oh yeah*    
>  
>*They give you your image and the things you believe*    
>  
>*Open your eyes, tell me what did you see?*  
>  
>*And I just think you thought it surreal*

Both *Red* and *Gutterflower* veer off the break-up theme a bit with a song about the downside of fame. The Lucky One is another midtempo acoustic, while What A Scene is a cynical hard rocker with distorted guitars. Rzeznik has stated this song was inspired by his move to Los Angeles and the celebrity worship culture there. The Lucky One starts with a line about ""the angel's city,"" cluing us in that it too is about LA. Both songs discuss the pitfalls of making it big (or the pursuit of it) with references to beauty standards, fakeness, and greed.

**Sad Beautiful Tragic vs. It's Over**

>*And time is taking its sweet time erasing you*    
>  
>*And you've got your demons*    
>  
>*And darlin', they all look like me*    
>  
>*'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there*    
>  
>*What a sad beautiful tragic love affair*

&#x200B;

>*And no one needs to know*  
>  
>*What goes on behind the door in my room*  
>  
>*I'm kicking through the walls in my mind*  
>  
>*And I can't stand without you*  
>  
>*And I won't find the answers when you're gone*

These are each the heaviest, darkest break-up songs of their respective albums. Sad Beautiful Tragic is very slow, with a more acoustic sound, while It's Over is more of a typical Goo hard ballad with some very anguished and husky vocals. In both cases, the singers have accepted the relationship is really over, and are wallowing in all the sorrow and regret that entails.

**The Track 5: Sympathy**

>*Stranger than your sympathy*  
>  
>*I take these things so I don't feel*  
>  
>*I'm killing myself from the inside out*  
>  
>*And now my head's been filled with doubt*

The literal fifth track of *Gutterflower* is What A Scene. However, with the Goos' reputations as Sensitive Balladeers™, their catalog is full of songs in the vulnerable/confessional style of Taylor's track 5s. On this album, I would give this distinction to track 8, Sympathy, another single. This quasi-country ditty, sometimes called Acoustic #4 by the fans, sees Rzeznik apologizing to his ex-wife for his insecurities and dishonesty that damaged the relationship. However, like many Taylor songs, he doesn't completely let her off the hook, reminding her of ""all these thoughts you stole from me."" Musically, it's unlike anything else on the record – imagine if Stay Stay Stay had track 5 lyrics ~~and was actually good~~.

**Robby Takac, Wielder of the Glitter Gel Pen**

*Red* is deliberately not ""sonically cohesive""; the electronic-tinged pop songs produced by Max Martin stand out among the rest of the album's country-rock feel. Surprise, neither is *Gutterflower*, albeit for a different reason. Every Goos album contains a few songs written and sung by their bassist, Robby Takac. You will not hear Takac's songs on the radio because he does not have a radio-friendly voice. It's very throaty and even nasal. His tracks tend to be shorter, boppier, and with a different lyrical style than Rzeznik's.

Robby has four songs on *Gutterflower*: You Never Know, Up Up Up, Smash, and Tucked Away. I personally don't think they're his best songs (for those, turn to their album *Superstar Car Wash*), but they definitely break up the often-heavy songs by Rzeznik. Just as *Red* has frequent changes of pace, so does *Gutterflower*.

**Conclusion**

While this began as just an idea in my mind, a connection between two artists I really love, I hope the connections are now clear how these albums share a lot of DNA. It’s been interesting to explore how two different artists handle the concept of a break-up album. If you love *Red* and are waiting for the TS rock album of our dreams, I think you may enjoy *Gutterflower*.

Finally, please enjoy [this video of Taylor and Johnny Rzeznik performing together on the *Speak Now* Tour](https://youtu.be/kCoeOT2Y34I). One can't help but wonder if the Goos influenced her, or at the very least, she was listening to their albums around the same time she wrote *Red*. I'll be on the lookout for other albums that I feel can be closely linked with Taylor's albums!",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/133u88x/love_and_sex_and_loneliness_thematic_parallels_in/,Love and Sex and Loneliness: Thematic Parallels in Taylor Swift’s RED and The Goo Goo Dolls’ GUTTERFLOWER,TaylorSwift,t3_133u88x,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/133u88x/love_and_sex_and_loneliness_thematic_parallels_in/,2023-04-30 15:03:33,Taylor Swift,0.112746716,0.05988032,"Love and Sex and Loneliness: Thematic Parallels in Taylor Swift’s RED and The Goo Goo Dolls’ GUTTERFLOWER A few days ago, someone made [a thread about pairing Taylor Swift songs with songs from other artists]( As I made my list, I realized how similar the album *Red* is to another pop-rock album, *Gutterflower* by the Goo Goo Dolls.

This is one of the few Goo songs where we know who it's about, as John used to subtly comment on it before playing it at concerts. Of course, with the details Taylor includes, there's no doubt who she's dissing here. Her approach is very sarcastic, taking jabs at her ex, while the Goos' is sympathetic to how Rzeznik's ex must be struggling without him.

**The Last Time vs. Here Is Gone**

>*This is the last time I'm asking you this*    
>  
>*Put my name at the top of your list*    
>  
>*This is the last time I'm asking you why*    
>  
>*You break my heart in the blink of an eye*

&#x200B;

>*And I want to get free, talk to me*     
>  
>*I can feel you falling*    
>  
>*And I wanted to be all you need*    
>  
>*Somehow, here is gone*

Though Here Is Gone isn't a duet, you can interpret the lyrics to come from both sides. It was probably the best known single from *Gutterflower*. These two acoustic pop-rock tunes convey the desperation of feeling the relationship falling apart, and the breakdown of communication between the singers and their partners.

**The Lucky One vs. What A Scene**

>*And they tell you that you're lucky, but you're so confused*  
>  
>*'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used*  
>  
>*And all the young things line up to take your place*  
>  
>*Another name goes up in lights*  
>  
>*You wonder if you'll make it out alive*

&#x200B;

>*And when you're looking for truth on the cover of a magazine*  
>  
>*How does it feel?*    
>  
>*When you found out what you're not gonna be, oh yeah*    
>  
>*They give you your image and the things you believe*    
>  
>*Open your eyes, tell me what did you see?*  
>  
>*And I just think you thought it surreal*

Both *Red* and *Gutterflower* veer off the break-up theme a bit with a song about the downside of fame. The Lucky One is another midtempo acoustic, while What A Scene is a cynical hard rocker with distorted guitars. Rzeznik has stated this song was inspired by his move to Los Angeles and the celebrity worship culture there. The Lucky One starts with a line about ""the angel's city,"" cluing us in that it too is about LA. Both songs discuss the pitfalls of making it big (or the pursuit of it) with references to beauty standards, fakeness, and greed.

**Sad Beautiful Tragic vs. It's Over**

>*And time is taking its sweet time erasing you*    
>  
>*And you've got your demons*    
>  
>*And darlin', they all look like me*    
>  
>*'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there*    
>  
>*What a sad beautiful tragic love affair*

&#x200B;

>*And no one needs to know*  
>  
>*What goes on behind the door in my room*  
>  
>*I'm kicking through the walls in my mind*  
>  
>*And I can't stand without you*  
>  
>*And I won't find the answers when you're gone*

These are each the heaviest, darkest break-up songs of their respective albums. Sad Beautiful Tragic is very slow, with a more acoustic sound, while It's Over is more of a typical Goo hard ballad with some very anguished and husky vocals. In both cases, the singers have accepted the relationship is really over, and are wallowing in all the sorrow and regret that entails.

**The Track 5: Sympathy**

>*Stranger than your sympathy*  
>  
>*I take these things so I don't feel*  
>  
>*I'm killing myself from the inside out*  
>  
>*And now my head's been filled with doubt*

The literal fifth track of *Gutterflower* is What A Scene. However, with the Goos' reputations as Sensitive Balladeers™, their catalog is full of songs in the vulnerable/confessional style of Taylor's track 5s. On this album, I would give this distinction to track 8, Sympathy, another single. This quasi-country ditty, sometimes called Acoustic #4 by the fans, sees Rzeznik apologizing to his ex-wife for his insecurities and dishonesty that damaged the relationship. However, like many Taylor songs, he doesn't completely let her off the hook, reminding her of ""all these thoughts you stole from me."" Musically, it's unlike anything else on the record – imagine if Stay Stay Stay had track 5 lyrics ~~and was actually good~~.

**Robby Takac, Wielder of the Glitter Gel Pen**

*Red* is deliberately not ""sonically cohesive""; the electronic-tinged pop songs produced by Max Martin stand out among the rest of the album's country-rock feel. Surprise, neither is *Gutterflower*, albeit for a different reason. Every Goos album contains a few songs written and sung by their bassist, Robby Takac. You will not hear Takac's songs on the radio because he does not have a radio-friendly voice. It's very throaty and even nasal. His tracks tend to be shorter, boppier, and with a different lyrical style than Rzeznik's.

Robby has four songs on *Gutterflower*: You Never Know, Up Up Up, Smash, and Tucked Away. I personally don't think they're his best songs (for those, turn to their album *Superstar Car Wash*), but they definitely break up the often-heavy songs by Rzeznik. Just as *Red* has frequent changes of pace, so does *Gutterflower*.

**Conclusion**

While this began as just an idea in my mind, a connection between two artists I really love, I hope the connections are now clear how these albums share a lot of DNA. It’s been interesting to explore how two different artists handle the concept of a break-up album. If you love *Red* and are waiting for the TS rock album of our dreams, I think you may enjoy *Gutterflower*.

Finally, please enjoy [this video of Taylor and Johnny Rzeznik performing together on the *Speak Now* Tour]( One can't help but wonder if the Goos influenced her, or at the very least, she was listening to their albums around the same time she wrote *Red*. I'll be on the lookout for other albums that I feel can be closely linked with Taylor's albums!",loe sex loneliness thematic parallel r goo goo doll gutterflower day ago someone make thread pair song

1418,"I've been a Taylor fan since 2008 when she showed up to sing a song with the Jonas brothers in NYC. I've seen her probably 15 times and have also met her. But now that I've gotten a bit older (I'm 28) I don't exactly have the time to dig into these theories and explore all the intracite easter eggs she leaves.

I've mostly seen this discussed on Tiktok, and whenever I leave any shred of well meaning uncertainty in a comment, I'm told that I'm ""obviously straight and should open my eyes"". I'm not straight, I'm bisexual.

I'm sure my friends speculated because no one was shocked. This is the one and only reason I have felt a little uncomfortable with the speculation, simply because I see it from my own perspective.

I'm doing a giveaway on a FB group for some TS vinyl and CDs and I realized they are a US only group when I had intended for one of my 2 copies of the Midnights (The Late Night Edition) CD to go to an international fan.

So, can anyone recommend a way to host a giveaway so that it is more fair and regulates who can join and also so that it can tell if someone is an international fan? Thanks!

International ONLY! Hello! I'm doing a giveaway on a FB group for some TS vinyl and CDs and I realized they are a US only group when I had intended for one of my 2 copies of the Midnights (The Late Night Edition) CD to go to an international fan. So now I'm trying to figure out how to do a giveaway - I want to do it a bit more securely than just hosting it on Reddit (too many spam accounts, and I'd really like to make sure this goes to an actual fan as much as possible).

So, can anyone recommend a way to host a giveaway so that it is more fair and regulates who can join and also so that it can tell if someone is an international fan? Thanks!

all american b*tch
- Sounds like traitor at first,then the chorus is very Avril Lavigne. Its giving bille eilish happier than ever also (the slow fast thing) sounds like two different songs. Gets experimental by the end. Can't understand lyrics on first listen. Enunciation sounds cursive, accent is very indie.
6/10

Lacy- It's giving Heather, Sofia… 🏳️‍🌈 
Fully Clairo style in this song. I don't hate it. The melody is nice. Why is she screaming in every song bridge? Outro is Billie Eilish😭 Is she unoriginal or we’re just having too many references, don't know. 
7.5/10

Ballad of a homeschooled girl-
Brutal 2.0. Chorus and second verse can get viral on tiktok for sure.  
Dont love it. She's screaming again.  5/10

Making the bed - Boring 🛌 💤 
Maybe will grow on me on 5th or 6th listen. Looks like a filler song
3/10

Logical 
- A ballad. Maybe lyrics will hurt those who are hurting already. Giving Traitor 2.0. Okayish. 
5/10

get him back! - Hmmmmmmm. This is nice. Wonder why i liked it. Maybe this is my mood right now. It's like bad idea right but better.
Its giving high school romcom soundtrack. I like it very much actually. 
9/10

Love is embarrassing - 80s vibe. Not bad. These type of sounds really suit her. Chorus is okayish. Verse was better. Gets repetitive by the end. 
8/10

The grudge - 
Another excessive indie accent. Lowkey boring. Sad lyrics, maybe requires us to get in that mood phase to truly understand and relate. 
6/10

Pretty isnt pretty - 
Love the instrumental. Soundtrack vibes. Probably about Body image. It's a decent song not the greatest but one of the good ones. 
8/10

teenage dream - 
Not what I expected (katy perry was on my mind) its giving One step forward 3 steps back. Seems like it's very personal to her, emotional. Can listen again

Looking at their participation rules, I have to assume it's because I don't feel comfortable interacting with the main sub and I am mostly interacting with the far corners of our fandom. But my online presence aside, I've been in the trenches and have stuck by Taylor's side through some of her most distasteful public narratives... and I just want to have a little holiday fun this year. I'd sign up for the 6th annual swiftmas gift exchange, but it is so disheartening being overlooked lol I am capable of sending a themed gift and spreading some holiday cheer !!!! My interpretation of her music doesn't change my desire for community !

But is that even something on our radar? Is that something our community would want? Would it feel too redundant?? Is it too late in the year to try and plan for this? Does anyone else feel ostracized by the main fandom and it kinda stings a bit more around this time of year?

20610,"Now that the 1989 TV track list has been released and we can see that Bad Blood ft. Kendrick Lamar and Sweeter than Fiction aren’t on it, it’s got me thinking. Neither of these songs currently have a home on an album, and whilst Taylor goes through her re-recordings, we’ve seen her place songs that had no home such as ‘Today was a Fairytale’ and ‘Ronan’ and give them an album. She has even retrospectively done this with songs such as ‘Eyes Open’ and ‘Safe & Sound.’

I sense we’ll get a Lover Deluxe for songs such as Need and Only The Young, Crazier and the Beautiful Eyes songs will be on Debut I imagine and I Don’t Wanna Live Forever might find a home on reputation TV, but do you think we might actually end this whole re-recording process with some songs still just … albumless? 

I don’t see why Taylor would release 1989 TV and then down the line do what she did with If This Was A Movie and the Hunger Games songs and put them on these albums after everyone’s already bought physical releases? It’s partly why I’ve yet to buy Fearless and Red TV because I hope she’ll release physical versions of the albums someday with those songs added.

5341,"I often see it mentioned here that London Boy was added to Lover at the last minute because of the masters heist (to cover up a failed coming out). The proof for this is usually offered that the songwriting credit on this song said he was given 24 hours in June to make a decision about whether to give approval for songwriting credits.

I think this is really unlikely mainly because there's a REALLY long lead time on pressed vinyl, especially custom pressed vinyl (like the Lover album is). The Lover vinyl was released on the same day as Lover in August 2023. There is almost no way that there would be a fully new run at THAT last minute without a very good reason (and I don't think ""covering up the gay"" would be enough of one). 

At the time of Lover, there were only two factories in the world that could do the lacquer (first step) for the vinyl Taylor uses. The worldwide production capacity for vinyl is only about 160 million a year, and that's higher than it was in 2019. Vinyl runs usually take a lead time of least 8-12 weeks for a mid tier artist on a big label (meaning the label would have priority, though spots are usually booked well in advance). I couldn't easily find how many LPs were pressed for Lover, but Adele pressed 500k for one of her albums, to give you an idea. It might be technically feasible for Taylkr to've done a last minute run by paying an exorbitant amount of money to take over other people's runs, but I think it's extremely unlikely.

I think the much more mundane reason is that she pays someone to scan her discography before it's released for possible copyright infringement or last minute credits request, and as part of that, they found the overlap with Cautious Clay's work. Much easier to reprint the outside case for the vinyl with updated credits than the vinyls themselves.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GaylorSwift/comments/17xg2m1/london_boy_wasnt_a_last_minute_addition/,London Boy wasn't a last minute addition,GaylorSwift,t3_17xg2m1,/r/GaylorSwift/comments/17xg2m1/london_boy_wasnt_a_last_minute_addition/,2023-11-17 14:19:28,Taylor Swift,0.112540044,0.03774539,"London Boy wasn't a last minute addition I often see it mentioned here that London Boy was added to Lover at the last minute because of the masters heist (to cover up a failed coming out).

33257,"hi! i made a taylor swift playlist, where basically i took a lot of her songs and turned them into a murder mystery story.

song 1: tolerate it- the main character (who’ve i’ve decided to name charlotte) is in a relationship where she doesn’t feel loved at all. she has been with this man for years, but within the past few months he’s been acting different.

song 2: the great war- charlotte confronts him, and they have a huge fight. in the end, the problem is never really resolved. he just tells charlotte he will try harder, and she decides to let it go.

song 3: high infidelity- charlotte can’t handle it anymore, nothing has changed in her relationship. actually, now he’s being worse, and hardly ever comes home. so one night, charlotte ends up going out with some friends, and cheating on her boyfriend. she feels so terrible and guilty. she never tells him.

song 4: champagne problems: a few months go by, and out of no where, he decides to propose to charlotte. he says that they’ve grown apart, and he thinks marriage will bring them back together. charlotte knows that she can’t marry him. they break up that night.

song 5: right where you left me- charlotte feels stuck after the breakup.

song 6: mad woman- charlotte feels angry now, she feels like she was unfairly treated, but at the same time she feels so terrible for cheating. she’s mad at herself more than anything. 

song 7: hoax- charlotte goes into a terrible stage of depression, and misses him every day. 

song 8: it’s nice to have a friend- charlotte meets este one night at a bar, and they become instant friends.

song 9: maroon- charlotte begins looking back at the relationship, and realizes she was treated unfairly, even at the begging of her relationship.

song 10: vigilante shit- charlotte finally is starting to feel better, and begins living for herself. she’s in her “revenge” era.

song 11: no body, no crime: charlotte finally feels better, more like herself. her and este meet up at olive garden every week.one week, este tells charlotte about her new boyfriend, who turns out to be charlottes ex, the one she just finished getting over. este didn’t know that was him, and charlotte doesn’t tell her. well, a few weeks later, este says thats he’s been acting differently. the next week, este doesn’t show up. charlotte drives by his house, and realizes he has new tires. he covered his tracks. charlotte knows what happened. out of anger and sadness, she kills him and gets away with it.

song 12: bigger than the whole sky- charlotte is back in a bad place after estes death.

song 13:mastermind- charlotte is still mourning estes death,but she finds comfort in knowing that she’s the reason estes killer is out of this world.

song 14: LWYMMD: charlottes sadness goes away and turns fully into anger and rage.

song 15: did something bad- charlotte knows she is no longer an innocent woman like she was a few months ago, and she’s okay with it.

song 16: carolina- this is a fast-forward to almost two decades in the future. charlotte leaves carolina (where the murder happened) knowing she got away with it.

let me know what you think!

Some of my favorite connections in her songs and some reasoning on the chapters:

* I didn't put Dear John/WCS in the first chapter because I feel like that's more trauma that she's processed than how she views/deals with heartbreak in relationships
* I added songs from 1989 that I thought would frame her best to transition to her mess chapter
* ""25 years old, how were you to know?"" from DWOHT and ""How's one to know?"" in ivy - I wrote [a whole thesis on it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/11gneas/ivy_analysis_20/) and how it all ties with High Infidelity
* Bejeweled at the start of her ""mess era"" and how ""a diamond's gotta shine"" up till the end in Maroon with ""the rubies that I gave up""
* Chapter 3 is just her being horny lol
* The songs in Ch.4 are the ones that I think address her anxiety in the relationship more, as opposed to more concrete conflicts in Ch.7
* In willow where she stresses ""there was one prize I'd *cheat* to win"" and you know she cheated to be with him
* Ch.6 I wanted some kind of transitions between Lavender Haze where she claims she doesn't want to be pressured into being his bride, to Paper Rings, to Lover (where it is obviously a wedding theme), so London Boy and Paris are between those songs 
* I was considering putting ME! in Ch.6 vs Ch.7 just because of how happy it sounds, but when you look at the lyrics it's really more of ""I know it's sometimes bad, but it can still be good"" kind of situation, it's really bargaining - ""You'll never find another like me"" 
* I didn't put the sad songs they wrote together as its own chapter, but instead as an interlude because... I felt like it was too short lol, and they were supposedly fiction
* In Ch.8 I kept with what Aaron said about hoax and the 1 being bookends of folklore, so it just made sense for me to keep them as is 
* Ch.8 You're Losing Me vs Maroon with the ""I chose you, I lost you"" theme 
* Ch.8, I know DBATC wasn't written with their breakup, but it still matches very well especially when you compare it with Cornelia Street: ""as if the streetlights pointed in an arrowhead leading us home"" vs ""I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright, they say I don't know""

Would it be a country pop album (Fearless, Speak Now) or some sort of country/pop/electro/rock hybrid (Red), or what? Please help me.",hae question relat question cant get oer friend say imagine didnt go pop instead make country album ie thinkingif make country album like others would current tracklist sound like would work country would country pop album fearless speak sort countrypopelectrorock hybrid r please help,8,"Music and Lyrics: Discussions and reflections on the emotional and personal impact of music, including how lyrics relate to relationships, identity, and cultural experiences."

6252,"We all care about Taylor a lot. One of the things that make her such a powerful and enduring artist is the quality of her intimate, personal lyrics. We feel connected to her that way. I’m close to Taylor in age and I’ve been a fan of her since Debut. In a lot of ways, I’ve grown up listening to her music, with it having different meaning for me at different times. 

I’m not coming here to tell you that we shouldn’t  feel connected to her “because she’s really a stranger” or that “we don’t really know her” or anything like that. No matter her professional persona or the details of her private life, what she puts out in her songs are clearly real, and very meaningful. 

That meaning doesn’t just go away.

Look, everything ends. Relationships end, people die, love fades away. But for a good life, a good love, the end is the least interesting part of it. 

Everything that Taylor felt about Joe, she poured it onto the page. In that moment, in that tune, it was REAL. That moment was frozen in time and put to song, and every time we hear that song or she sings that song, the moment is relived. And that’s beautiful! The essence of art is that it surpasses its roots. Fearless was written by a young girl leaving her girlhood behind, and is still a very young, optimistic, even naive album. But that’s okay, because that was the truth of her in that moment, and that truth is now forever preserved. She doesn’t need to be a young girl again to tap into that moment and memory and neither do we to feel it.

The love that the two of them shared for six long years was clearly real. Just because it wasn’t forever doesn’t mean we can’t revisit it or use it or love it. The next generation will listen to Daylight and smile in that golden haze of love, and it won’t matter who it was about or why it was written or who broke up with whom then.

Taylor will write about it and give us answers in her way. Even if she doesn’t, that’s okay, she doesn’t owe us that. All we can do is support her and cheer for her as loud as we can, so that she knows she’s still loved.

20000,"IMO the existing titles for each album are perfect, but let's just do this for fun. So either name each album after the title of a song, referencing the title of a song or referencing a lyric from a song on the album. For me:

Debut -> Tim McGraw  
just to be cheeky because imagine seeing an album cover with TIM MCGRAW on the shelves with a photo of a blonde 16yo

1989 -> New Romantics  
I feel like the concept of a ""New Romantic"" in general encapsulates Taylor's point in life when writing 1989; it was something very new for her and considered quite rebellious for her good-girl country image while still maintaining a high level of class.

Speak Now -> Enchanted  
I feel like the whole vibe of the album is very fairytale/film like and overall ""enchanting"" + it's what Taylor wanted to call the album in the first place

Midnights -> Karma  
just to make that one theory come true

Red -> Blue  
Not my favourite, but referencing ""losing him was blue, like I'd never known"" because the album is her most heartbreaking and ""blue"" overall.

I couldn't think of ones for the others. What would you guys call them?

Edit: Just thought I'd share some of my other favourites from the comments -

Reputation -> Delicate  
But with the same album cover would be just hauntingly beautiful

Lover -> Daylight  
It just sounds like a really beautiful name for an album

Fearless -> Change OR Forever & Always  
When I think of which song best embodies the album, for me it's Change (Taylor's career definitely took a turning point with this album). F&A seems to be popular amongst fans and honestly I can get behind it

Folklore -> Exile  
Written/Released during CoVid, makes a lot of sense

Evermore -> Gold Rush OR Rose Blush (latter was my own choice)  
Gold Rush is lyrically one of my favourite songs she's ever written, specifically ""slow motion double vision in a rose blush"" is just such a beautiful way to describe the la vie en rose style.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/15px14v/if_you_could_rename_each_of_or_any_of_the_albums/,"If you could rename each of (or any of) the albums based on one song from each album (excluding any songs that are the titles of existing albums), what would you call each?",TaylorSwift,t3_15px14v,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/15px14v/if_you_could_rename_each_of_or_any_of_the_albums/,2023-08-13 11:59:03,Taylor Swift,0.11119666,0.06624055,"If you could rename each of (or any of) the albums based on one song from each album (excluding any songs that are the titles of existing albums), what would you call each?

33138,"I am compelled to write romance novels, and I want to write a story with a good grovel with the boy doing everything in his power to get the girl back, since the really good grovels are rare in the romance genre. 

I think drawing inspiration from ""Betty"" was really helpful to get the juices flowing. If I wrote the grovel/retribution story, it would take place like 10 years in the future so it could be a bit more believable that she'd forgive him years later. I'm also considering writing Augustine's story to practice some more.

I am compelled to write romance novels, and I want to write a story with a good grovel with the boy doing everything in his power to get the girl back, since the really good grovels are rare in the romance genre. 

I think drawing inspiration from ""Betty"" was really helpful to get the juices flowing. If I wrote the grovel/retribution story, it would take place like 10 years in the future so it could be a bit more believable that she'd forgive him years later. I'm also considering writing Augustine's story to practice some more.

Being married to Josh doesn’t mean she’s on the side of the Kushner’s and Josh can’t help that they’re his family. She’s never once supported her in laws, both her and Josh voted democrat in the last 2 elections, Karlie is supporting young women in STEM w her Kode with Klossy, she’s fighting for abortion rights and started a whole coalition to do so, she’s part of an organization that’s fighting for AI regulations, and shes been very active about supporting progressive issues in general. Josh has also taken Karlie’s side against his family and it’s not a secret they aren’t on good terms.

I also feel like so many people are out here believing that rumor that she had something to do with the masters heist when that rumor held ZERO validity to begin with, I mean, it came from Perez Hilton ffs. Karlie being managed by Scooter still at that point doesn’t actually mean anything and she parted ways with him the first chance she got. Taylor herself said that no one in her inner circle knew about it. Karlie even tweeted out saying she always will have Taylor’s back. Historically she has never done anything to deserve the hate she gets. We don’t actually know the inner logistics of what part Josh’s FAMILIES company played in the sale or if Josh had any sort of control or influence over the situation, nor Karlie by proxy. It’s unfair to make assumptions about something we have no actual knowledge or information about aside from the names attached.

I’m not saying that something didn’t go down between Karlie and Taylor bc Taylor’s music speaks to it but, her music also speaks to forgiveness and reconciliation and continued love for a muse that, to me, is clearly Karlie coded.

But in school I was made fun of and put down for liking Taylor Swift and it wasn't the cool thing to be. Well come 2014 with the release of 1989 and all the kids who made fun of me then loved Taylor and acted like they were #1 fans. They called themselves Swifties yet they were the first to drop during reputation but the loudest with Midnights. 

I do not mean to gatekeep. I am so happy people appreciate Taylor and her music - she deserves it! But I cannot stand the bandwagonning and the insane obessive and stalking behaviors where people center their entire personality around her Taylor.

I avoid the term Swiftie...I admire Taylor, respect her, and adore her music which has been the soundtrack to my life.

Innocent, but then he says that he’s into girls with bobs lately and seeing him mention that after speaking of Haerin makes me think that he meant that he’s into Haerin in a different way. But, that’s not the worst part imo.

Then [he’s asked Nayeon vs Haerin](https://twitter.com/adorekeeho/status/1644408311490519058?s=46&t=OqfuIeUht_MjO8S_R5q9fw) this is an ideal type battle, basically who do you think is more attractive or who you rather choose to date. He then chooses Haerin, the 16 year old, then says but she’s too young RIGHT NOW(to which he makes a clear disappointed face) then calls (?) the conversation dangerous?? Are you being serious? I’m sorry, this is truly disgusting behavior. Odd behavior from both the interviewee and him, but especially him. I’m sorry, I don’t think you can justify it… 

What was also weird to me was him saying “But wait…” after saying she was too young and thinks to himself, and I’m curious as to what he meant by that…

8322,"Midnights came out October 21 2022. With 1989TV coming out October 27 2023, I don’t know if it’s reasonable now to hope for something like a two-disc vinyl album of Midnights with ALL the songs to celebrate its one year anniversary. I’ve seen this theory float around before, and it’s what I’ve been hoping for as well, but I’m sure vinyl production for 1989 TV is gonna be in overdrive, especially since this album is a two-disc album.

I mean, it’s possible there’s some sort of limited run of Midnights deluxe (?) vinyls for pre-order the week or two before its anniversary, and then the focus after that date fully becomes 1989TV. But I’m sure it would still be a lot of vinyls to have produced for two different two-disc albums just one week apart from each other. And that’s not including the work her merch team will do to get everything shipped (aka at least slap shipping labels on them so they count for first-week sales 🙃) the first week 1989TV comes out.

9235,"I'm sure this question is common knowledge, but, aside from new releases or features, I hardly stream Taylor's music and instead stick to the physical media. I've started streaming her more recently but I don't want to stream tracks which are not Taylor's Version, regardless of if there is a Taylor's Version available (since I have the physical media, so I personally would rather play non-Taylor's version music offline and Taylor's Version music online). So, how can I know?

Obviously, the tracks originally from Fearless, Red and Speak Now all say (Taylor's Version), but what about live performances? Singles? And so on?

Basically, can someone tell me whether *you know who* owns the masters or if they're safe to stream, as Taylor does. Or, if there's a secret third option and they're under a different label. I'm also assuming any track in/after 2019 is safe to stream, as she changed records late 2018. But please correct me if that's wrong!

Anyway, the songs I'm unsure about are:

* Back To December/Apologize/You're Not Sorry, Drops Of Jupiter, Bette Davis Eyes, I Want You Back from *Speak Now World Tour Live*
* Our Song, Teardrops On My Guitar, Should've Said No from *Fearless (International Mix)*
* Beautiful Eyes from *Live From Clear Channel Stripped 2008*
* Delicate (Seeb Remix), (Sawyr And Ryan Tedder Remix), ...Ready For It? (BloodPop Remix)
* September, Delicate from *Spotify Singles*
* *The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection EP*; 6 covers
* Crazier from *Hannah Montana The Movie* (Some sources say this is under Walt Disney's label - which is under UMG, like Republic is - but others say BMR)

The players are each a guardian of one of Taylor's ten albums in Swift Town--Taylor's Version.

The players must enter each album, complete the tasks, and fight the enemies there in order to restore the album to its original beauty and rescue it from Scooter.

Each album has its own one shot campaign with its own mood and approach. In Fearless, players have to solve a murder mystery at a goblin high school. In Red, they have to race wraiths and skeletons around a track littered with enemies and obstacles. In 1989, they fight Mind Flayers in the Underdark. In Midnights, they complete escape room puzzles to rescue remaining vault songs and fight a Lamia. 

The players each got a special item themed to their album that has special abilities for them to use once a day. The Reputation rogue, for example, had an invisible locket that could cast Invisible once a day.

19802,"Far be it for me to contradict Dr Swift but I am not sure being male and turning up to a Taylor Swift concert is a sign of emotional intelligence. And incidentally unironically liking the Barbie movie isn't either. I honestly believe there is something more profound going on.

I have, over the last few years, had my optimism about the future sucked out of me. The issues of climate change, populist fuckwittery and the feeling that battles for equity and equality I thought were won turned out not to have been have worn me down. The unvarnished joy of Swifties communing has restored some of my hope for the future.

When I became a fan of Taylor in 2020 I kept my thoughts to myself, especially with male friends. In 2023 there are still some comments about Taylor just being a pop pixie but they are way less. Men are taking her more seriously. And, perhaps over optimistically, I think men are taking women's political and social power more seriously than they have before.

There have been serious discussions in the Financial Times and Economist about the implications of Taylor Swift and Barbie on society. This was not happening 3 years ago. The notion that a man liking art that was made by women is odd or suspect is being eroded.

I have been assured by women on this subreddit that I and my cohort of older Swiftie men are welcome and the evidence from the concerts is that that is true. I don't think we are any more emotionally intelligent or enlightened than anyone else. Just that the tide is turning away from male dominated culture and politics and we have latched on to one aspect of it.

Now the video explained that a lot of other stuff went down and in I believe 2012 said guitar teacher did an exclusive interview/article where be said some bad stuff about Taylor's family regarding her ED and he called her spoiled. 

There was also another story from Taylor in an early interview where she said that the guitar teacher was kind of an a hole and he said that she couldn't play the 12 string, and that was the whole reason she learned to play the 12 string.

How to Play:  The bingo card template that I have created can be found in the link, please make a copy.   

You must choose 10 songs from each of Taylor’s 10 Albums (Taylor Swift, Fearless, Speak Now, Red, 1989, Reputation, Lover, folklore, evermore, Midnights.) All songs from deluxe versions will be called, however extra things (Piano/Pop versions, voice memos, messages, etc.) will not be called, then add them to their respective cells 

 Then choose 4 FTV tracks from each of the four TV albums, please do not use TV songs. And finally, the 5 Wild spaces are where you can choose any song from any of the 10 albums or FTV tracks. Please do not choose songs that are from Beautiful Eyes, any of the Christmas tunes or any singles unless they are from their specific album.  

Each day I will be randomly spinning a wheel and posting the result of the wheel, if you have that specific song, use the line tool or something that will show you that the song has been called. 

 A Songs Called List will be posted with the bingo call for anyone to make sure that any missing songs have been crossed off, or for anyone who wants to join the game. 

 We will be following classic American Bingo rules, so the winners of each of the different patterns will win the following: 

 Line-A shoutout 

X-A shoutout 

Blackout-A certificate 

  Rules:  Ronan is not going to be called or should be used in this game due to the r/taylorgameswannaplay rules.  

If you get a bingo, immediately call bingo in the comments of the most recent song post, do NOT wait until you have multiple lines to call bingo, the first person that calls it will get the win. 

 If a song that you have missed gets you a bingo, DO NOT call bingo, if you have missed crossing off songs and you get a bingo from the most recent song, then you may call bingo 

 Please don’t fake fake fake fake fake, it ruins the game for everyone.

30496,"Personally, I wouldn't refer to myself as ever being a ""Swiftie""— not that I've ever disliked her, rather pop music has never been a No. 1 genre for me— still I've always respected her as a good artist and definitely a great lyricist. However, as of the release of 'Midnights' I've been worried for how she'll progress as an artist and frankly her integrity. Midnights (for me) marks a sharp decline in her quality of writing and artistic direction and as a clear example of how her label may be trying to make her more commercially profitable and create more industry manufactured records. 

From lines such as, ""Draw the cat eye sharp enough to kill a man"", and rhymes having the impact of a 2013 teenage Tumblr poet's work- I found much of Midnights very mediocre and bland and at it's worst cringey; and yes, despite me daring to criticise her work I don't want the parts I liked to be overlooked (i.e. Lavender Haze). As my knowledge of her work is by no means encyclopedic I wanted to know if those of r/TaylorSwift could give their thoughts on this topic and thus expand upon my sole perspective. Did you like Midnights? Why or why not? Do you prefer what she has done with her more pop centered records (Midnights, Lover, etc.) or her folk ones? Do you see her lyricism on much of Midnights as not up to her usual standard? If anything, please let me know in the comments! :-)

I’m not really that familiar with Taylor’s work outside of her singles. I like a lot of songs from 1989 and I also really liked Evermore and Folklore. Aside from that I don’t know much about her. 

I’m doing an album review series where I go into artists’ discographies from start to finish, and since her tour has pretty much taken over the world (and I know that people rave about her pen) I figured I’d start here. 

My question is: should I start with the original versions of her first few albums, or should I start with her recent re-recordings? My logic is that it would be better to start with the originals, since they’re what got people into her in the first place. But I imagine the more recent versions sound closer to what she originally wanted it to sound like (my guess, anyway. I could be way off lol).

Thanks in advance for the help ✨",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/12zit3y/question_from_a_nonfan_where_to_start_taylors/,Question from a Non-Fan: Where to Start?
