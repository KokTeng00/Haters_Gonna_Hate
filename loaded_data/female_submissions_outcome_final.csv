17844,"The title speaks for itself. What do you think is/are the most nuanced Taylor songs?

The one that comes to my mind is happiness, and funny enough, that is what inspired this post. I like the fact that she‚Äôs not demonizing the guy she‚Äôs singing about but is acknowledging where things went wrong with their relationship. 

August &amp; illicit affairs are close seconds as well. She could‚Äôve easily chosen to demonize the girl that James cheated with in August, but she chose to humanize her instead. It wasn‚Äôt one of those situations where it was like, ‚ÄúHey, you stole my boyfriend and I think you‚Äôre a whore!‚Äù As for illicit affairs, while I‚Äôm not one to endorse cheating, I like the fact that she makes it clear that cheating isn‚Äôt all black and white. 

Anyways, let me know what you all think the most nuanced Taylor songs are.

16019,"I know there is a post about how this video has so much Gaylor proof in it quite often on this sub, but I wanted to make another one to collect all the ideas I‚Äôve come across and what others think as well. First of all, if you watch the ‚ÄúTaylor Swift - Call It What You Want (Sings to Joe - Home Version)‚Äù on Youtube, all these things become a lot more obvious. (Couldn‚Äôt get the video to link to the post for some reason so I just typed the name of the video.

1. The hair flipping that most people are aware of, but I wanted to point out that in this video starting at :44 and ending at 1:00 it is very clearly a female‚Äôs shadow, much more than the version shown in the actual documentary. First the camera starts shaking, so you can see that the person (probably Karlie) is setting down the phone on something. Then, you can see her flipping down her hair and tying it up very, very clearly. This is honestly just so obviously a woman that I cannot believe anyone can think Taylor is singing to Joe after watching this video.

2. Then there‚Äôs the ‚ÄúI did one thing right‚Äù line right after the video cuts back to Taylor, that probably isn‚Äôt Taylor singing, and is actually Karlie, at about 1:10. When you have your eyes open watching the video, it seems like it‚Äôs Taylor singing because she‚Äôs mouthing it, but when you close your eyes it seems like it‚Äôs probably Karlie instead. Taylor also leans back at points her foot at the camera during this moment, which seem like she‚Äôs signaling for Karlie to start singing at that moment. 

3. At about 1:32, Taylor sings ‚Äúcall it what you want to‚Äù and while she‚Äôs singing a feminine voice says ‚Äúyesssss.‚Äù Other Swifties think this is Taylor singing, but that doesn‚Äôt name any sense since the person is saying that while Taylor is singing. Also, there‚Äôs no way it could be Joe because the voice is clearly feminine. 

4. At the very end of the video at the last ‚Äúcall it what you want,‚Äù it sounds a little bit like the same feminine voice is singing with her. This could also be just the guitar making it sound that way though, but I thought I would still point it out.

5. Another thing about this video is in the documentary scene there‚Äôs a lot of parts where it looks like some parts of the video have been cut out, so who knows what we‚Äôre not being shown that could make it even clearer that it‚Äôs Karlie. I know that showing different videos during the video makes the video more interesting for the audience and is completely normal, but the editors could‚Äôve also placed these videos over the original video strategically to parts where Karlie is more clearly shown are cut off. 

When I first saw this theory about the Call It What You Want video, I originally doubted it because that clip when Taylor takes the person‚Äôs hand and kisses it, it does seem like what a man‚Äôs hand would typically look like. But then I looked at some pictures of Karlie‚Äôs hands and realized that the hands in the clip could easily be her hands as well.

This video is probably one of the strongest Gaylor proof. Especially with the hair flipping that 100% is not Joe.

edit: just saw a comment on an earlier post saying that the back vocal at about 2:40 of the actual song you can hear the backing vocals clearly saying ‚ÄúKarlie all I want is you.‚Äù",https://www.reddit.com/r/GaylorSwift/comments/17wgdk9/call_it_want_you_want_miss_americana/,Call It Want You Want Miss Americana,GaylorSwift,t3_17wgdk9,/r/GaylorSwift/comments/17wgdk9/call_it_want_you_want_miss_americana/,2023-11-16 06:42:46,Taylor Swift
4540,"The title says it all.  Taylor can't be expected to live her life in the closet just because of the women she's reportly dated not being out. More to the point the act of her coming out while yes it would make the relationships she's been in harder to deny it still wouldn't outright confirm them. In order for that to be the case Taylor would have to explicitly say something about them which she wouldn't do a) because they aren't out and more importantly b) because she's never really talked about her straight relationships either. 


If you believe the rumor that she was going to come out in 2019 but got derailed because of the masters heist Dianna and Karlie don't even really factor in to it. The plans were in place and she was going to come out on rolling stone but backed out at the last second and now that interview is called ""the root canal interview"" because the interviewer said he felt like he was giving her a root canal lrpbaybecause she felt like it wasn't a good time to come out anymore.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Gaylor_Swift/comments/16bv0d8/i_know_theres_a_theory_that_taylor_hasnt_came_out/,I know there's a theory that taylor hasn't came out yet because of Karlie and Dianna but I don't think that's the case,Gaylor_Swift,t3_16bv0d8,/r/Gaylor_Swift/comments/16bv0d8/i_know_theres_a_theory_that_taylor_hasnt_came_out/,2023-09-06 20:27:07,Taylor Swift

# [Round 17: the lakes](https://forms.gle/cbtDULkAd9xZcM7Z6)

Note: Since this the first round in which there is an alternate version of the song, I thought this would be a good time to address songs like that. Alternate version of songs that are **almost** sonically identical will not get separated for this game. For round such as the lakes (or All Too Well 10, as another example; there will be separate rounds for ATW 5 and ATW 10), you can choose whichever version of the song is your favorite when voting. With songs such as State of Grace, I will host one round for both version of songs (one round, one form, two questions in the form). For songs like Girl at Home (re-record ""glow-up"" songs), I will only hold a round for Taylor's Version. I will not include ""concert"" versions either (example: I Knew You Were Trouble from the 1989 tour will not get a round). Once we finish Lover, I will share my plan on how I intend to handle albums that have not been re-record yet.

I‚Äôm usually more into the kind of stuff I play (stoner metal basically, and unless you‚Äôre hella into niche doom metal, you most likely have never heard of my band or me‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd prefer to be anon bc I have no social media for a reason..)

Finding this sub has been such a breath of fresh air for me because I always saw such a queer bend in her songs and I always admired how much of a ‚Äúgirl‚Äôs girl‚Äù Taylor seems to be. I love re-listening to her songs with the knowledge that she might be queer. I spent a lot of time very painfully in the closet so even if none of this ever gets verified, I still enjoy the fan fiction very much. I had a really horrible childhood and my parents were incredibly homophobic and abusive. Taylor has been helping me get through this since I was a minor. (Big giant shout out to Sleep, Electric Wizard, King Woman, and Subrosa as well! Also Boygenius, Julian Baker and Phoebe Bridgers!)

22445,"Not the lyrics themselves or the melody, I'm strictly talking about the way she says/delivers lines.

""No one has to know"" in Ready For It. The whisper and spoken words together is good.

""My body, my love"" in DBATC, especially live in Paris. So sad.

""You'll all get YOURS"" in LWYMMD. I don't like this song but I loveeeee the way she says that.

""I felt your arms twisting around me"" in Wonderland. I just love the way she says ""twisting"". ""And we both went MAD!"" is excellent too, I like her theatrical side.

""Alone"" in Gorgeous because you can just feel her shrugging or rolling her eyes when she says it.

""THINK about what you did"" especially just before the second chorus in BTR (I'm going to miss that in TV, I think)

From what I‚Äôve experienced, it is not limited to this sub only but I can appreciate how frustrating it must be to want to partake in a poll game only to get error messages. Currently, the best advice I have is keep refreshing the page and try again until it works.

I‚Äôll update this post when I hear back from the admin team with what resolution they were able to provide (if any).

If track three is called ""Bob"", that counts. If track seven is called ""Robert‚Ä¶"" that doesn‚Äòt, because Robert is only 6 letters and the periods don‚Äòt count.

Problem is, we live in a kinda rural area of the US where KPop is not popular at all amongst her age group. Like, not at all. 

She has no one to bond with on this level and idk I think it‚Äôs hard for her to make friends cause no one cares at all about her biggest love. Well she‚Äôs pretty into Roblox too lol. 

I‚Äôve pretty much forbidden her to make friends on the Internet cause I‚Äôm terrified of that lol, but Idk what to do anymore. 

I want her to have friends to talk to and share this with, not be lonely, ya know? She doesn‚Äôt really talk on the phone or go to sleepovers or any of the things I remember getting into at her age. 

Are there any age-appropriate chat rooms or anything like that that any of you know about? Do any of you have a daughter in a similar position?

14467,"When I first heard this song it was on youtube. Before the beat drops where she says ""famefcker bloodsucker"" in one version it makes the ""thump thump thump"" sound. This is the version that is most common and used in both the clean and explicit version. 

However there is another version that has a mic drop screech sound instead of the ""thump thump thump"". I can't find any videos with this version on youtube anymore, but I am positive it existed(it was also removed from my playlist).

I am not an avid fan, more so a casual listener but I‚Äôm really excited to take my mom and aunts and let them bask in it all! Because of that, I need some of y‚Äôall real Swifties to clue me in so I can make sure this is unforgettable for them. 

I already got them going with their outfits (my mom is doing Lover and I‚Äôm giving her kandi to trade at the concert cause tbh I just want girls to compliment her!!) but my ladies are very concerned about the shoe situation. For anyone who wore a ~cute~ shoe with a little boot or heel or something- did you regret it? Is it better to just opt for a less cute and more comfortable shoe? 

Another major concern- and please don‚Äôt drag us- my mom and aunts are planning on napping and eating through the openers to be able to make it through Taylor‚Äôs whole set. Because of this, my mom and I are a little concerned about being able to get good merch. I want to be able to get some good stuff for my Swiftie friends who actually deserve to be there and not some stupid tote bag lol. So with that being said- do things sell out quickly? Are we totally screwed getting there as late as planned?

And last but not least- the chants. I want them to feel like they‚Äôre apart of the whole thing, so is there any little crowd moments like that one LGB chant that I can tell them about? Any little inside jokes or Swift lore I can clue them into that might be relevant?

Well after reading Reddit posts about it and studding The Man music Video I have a brand new theory. 

Could Karma be one of those other theories based off Karma was actually WRITTEN TWICE in the music Video once in Orange but Again in Black. 

Since The Man came out February 27, 2020 we know that the Taylor‚Äôs Versions are coming. What if she was pointing out the Karma going to be delivered to Scooter Braun with the re-releases coming. Plus, she‚Äôs going to put out a new Album called Karma. 

 Since it was written twice what if Midnights was gonna be Karma since it has a Song named Karma. Now I know Taylor said she wrote Karma after Jack gave her the track after the track was created and then wrote  the song we know as Karma! Then Decided that she wanted to call The Album Midnights because it fit the album theme more than Karma. Then she changed the color  because a Midnight sky isn‚Äôt Orange but a dark blue. 



So what do you think?

2346,"I've heard from a couple of industry insiders that a Japanese debut might be imminent (before the end of the year but probably much sooner) so I wanted to put a feeler out to see what everyone's thoughts are.

A couple of things to consider

1) Is the timing right? - There is apparently a lot of discussion within the industry about the big picture as it relates to NewJeans. By playing their cards right, some experts think that the NJs sphere of influence can penetrate the Western market unlike any other K-pop groups (except BTS of course). Given this, is it the right time to try and make inroads into the Japanese market? 

As far as I can tell, it's not entirely unprecedented for a group to debut in Japan this soon. Twice, BP, BTS, IVE have all had their Japanese debut about 1 to 1.5 yrs after their Korean debut. It seems like a logical next step to me but will there be a significant opportunity cost if they forgo a chance to focus on the Western market?

2) Music and Concepting - Do they choose to go with a basic compilation album or do something completely original? There's no doubt that almost all of NJs discography is popular in Japan right now. Releasing Japanese versions of existing songs is probably the safest bet but is it on brand for NJs/MHJ? I do think there's potential here to create a unique enough identity for themselves that can pay huge dividends down the line. 

If they decide to do something original, what kind of music and concept would you like to see? I kind of get the feeling that a city pop vibe would be the fan favorite but still interested to see if there are some diverse opinions. 

&amp;#x200B;

22593,"In all of the re-recordings there has been 6 never officially released before tracks.

Fearless TV had 6: You All Over Me, Mr. Perfectly Fine, We Were Happy, That's When, Don't You and Bye Bye Baby.

Red TV had 9 tracks considered From The Vault, but three of them were already heard before songs (Babe, Better Man and All Too Well), while the other 6 were brand new: Nothing New, Message in a Bottle, I Bet You Think About Me, Forever Winter, Run and The Very First Night.

Speak Now TV will also have 6: Electric Touch, When Emma Falls in Love, I Can See You, Castles Crumbling, Foolish One and Timeless.

Do you guys think Taylor will keep this pattern for the next re-recordings?

23032," Taylor is one of the greatest storytellers of our generation, but I think a lot of her appeal is not not the stories she tells, but the way she gives us more tools to tell our own stories.  There have been many instances where one of her songs captures a feeling that I‚Äôve had for a long time but never really had the words to articulate, and Taylor‚Äôs work essentially creates that vocabulary for me.  An example of that process for me is when I listened to Never Grow Up for the first time while listening to Speak Now TV, and it suddenly felt like years of vague, incoherent, and wistful thinking about my childhood were suddenly woven into a tight narrative that my brain could more easily process.  It‚Äôs not that Taylor‚Äôs story is my story, but I suddenly feel like I have words to describe my experiences in ways I couldn‚Äôt before.

18944,"**Glitch,** one of my favourite Midnights songs, has gained a WHOLE new meaning after the breakup.

It was supposed to be a song about the narrator falling in love with ssomeone that was just a friend but found true romance in them, which is so unlikely based on their past it's like a Glitch, and indeed it is.

The fact it was romance and not love already seems weird right of the start to me but that may be because I'm not a native speaker, but still. This was a true romance, a passion that lasted for way to long. A glitch.

And now that the breakup has happened I view this song as a someone who is so carelessly singing about finding love and self worth. Not realising they've also founf love in themselves. This is all just aweird to them. And glitches as we all know, can get fixed. The glitch was fixed, the relationship run its coarse and the love blackout is done. The glitch which is now over with can allow both people trapped in it, which were slowly drifting away, to focus on the love they found for their own self and life. The narrator fastening herself to him with a stitch is also an amazing metaphor, especially now, it feels as if someone tried to hard to keep going, not caring but knowing that if they never tried they would've lost eachother faster, so she put in the work. But fate was sealed by that point, in the end of the song where they see eachother lose themselves in the bridge and final chorus, truly a thrilling, heartbreaking and breathtaking look into a love that lasted more than it should've and a love who helped both people indevidually grow together in harmony but let them slowly detouch and grow by themselves, does anyone agree? Are there objections or what IS your POV? Please share your thoughts with me, i'd love to discuss :).",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/12mcz4u/glitch_an_analysis_of_an_overlooked_song_that_now/,"""Glitch"" an analysis of an overlooked song that now has a whole new meaning.",TaylorSwift,t3_12mcz4u,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/12mcz4u/glitch_an_analysis_of_an_overlooked_song_that_now/,2023-04-14 20:51:43,Taylor Swift
5657,"So I was in the other reddit and the question is what is she obsessed with based on her lyrics. So of course dancing, love, and 2AM came up. But then someone brought up her use of rhyming car and bar and that ever since 2014 each album has a song where those things rhyme. And interestingly, the songs include cruel summer, cowboy like me, hits different. Songs that are more obviously queercoded. I'm not a very good lyric sleuth so I hope yall can find more and see if they're all in very queercoded songs or not. 

Side note: this is not a quest to romantically link her to a specific muse whose name is Kar, as it is to find a pattern of rhyme choice that may suggest one muse for queercoded songs. It's just a bit of an obvious leap to connect those two things, but I dont wish to speculate on that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Gaylor_Swift/comments/18upzza/carbar_rhyme/,Car/bar rhyme,Gaylor_Swift,t3_18upzza,/r/Gaylor_Swift/comments/18upzza/carbar_rhyme/,2023-12-30 21:16:39,Taylor Swift

17117,"Taylor Swift's Netflix documentary, ""Miss Americana,"" provides a raw and honest portrayal of the realities of being a celebrity. The film highlights the intense pressures and expectations that come with fame, including the constant need to please fans, media, and critics.

One of the key takeaways from the documentary is the way in which celebrities are often expected to maintain a certain image, even if it goes against their true selves. Swift speaks about feeling like she was living a ""performance"" and how the pressure to be ""perfect"" took a toll on her mental health.

The film also sheds light on the negativity that comes with fame, including the constant barrage of criticism and hate that celebrities receive on social media. Swift highlights the impact this can have on someone's self-esteem and how it can be difficult to maintain a positive outlook.

Throughout the film, it's evident that Swift's desire to be her own person and speak out on issues she cares about has been stifled by the expectations placed upon her. It's clear that if she were able to fully embrace her individuality and let her true self shine through, she might have been happier and more fulfilled as a person and an artist.

The film serves as a powerful reminder that fame and success do not always equal happiness, and that it's important to prioritize our own well-being and values over the opinions of others. Swift's bravery in speaking out about her experiences in ""Miss Americana"" is sure to inspire others to do the same and break free from the constraints of societal expectations.

Overall, ""Miss Americana"" provides an eye-opening look into the challenges of being a celebrity and the toll it can take on one's personal and professional life. It serves as a reminder that, despite their fame and fortune, celebrities are human too and deserve empathy and understanding.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/10pzpzv/miss_americana_a_revealing_look_into_the/,Miss Americana: A Revealing Look into the Pressures of Celebrity Life,TaylorSwift,t3_10pzpzv,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/10pzpzv/miss_americana_a_revealing_look_into_the/,2023-01-31 13:58:22,Taylor Swift

19509,"So, I've been reading all the news, waiting for anything to specifically come from Taylor or Joe about this breakup. I'm 35 and I know that right before I got married at 33, if I had been with somebody for 6 years, I would be sad I having to start over again in my mid thirties. I think about how Taylor Swift will have a hard time dating, because she is so famous, she's going to have to watch out for people with ill intentions and just everything else plus some. And while many outlets have been not a huge fan of Joe, just a huge fan of Joe for Taylor, I realized that I also agree with this. I say this as I watch all of the live footage on YouTube  from her eras Tour and realize just how comfortable and confident she's finally become.  I remember watching Miss Americana and just thinking how much I felt for her because it's hard to be confident in your own skin and it took me so long to figure out how to be that. I just wonder who she will fall in love with that will finally complement her and her greatness, instead of keeping her locked away because they don't deal with fame well or just being a crappy guy. So for this discussion You can comment on anything I just wrote, or write a time that you think Taylor Swift looked confident because I think it's important that we bring that to illumination as she has worked very hard on being okay with herself, with her glorious self I might add ‚ù§Ô∏è",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/13168cz/taylor_swift_finally_comfortable_and_confident/,Taylor Swift finally comfortable and confident,TaylorSwift,t3_13168cz,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/13168cz/taylor_swift_finally_comfortable_and_confident/,2023-04-27 20:47:05,Taylor Swift

25593,"So the other day I saw a comment on my post, something about James and Betty getting back together. That got me thinking, that many people probably assume that Taylor hinted towards them getting back together but I personally feel like many of y'all misunderstood. Just hear me out, I promise I make sense. I HAVE LITERALLY BEEN DYING TO TELL THIS TO SOMEONE.


So first thing's first, my interpretation from cardigan, especially these lyrics is that:
""Chase two girls, LOSE the one"" - it clearly states that in an attempt to be with two people, James lost Betty. 

""I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs"" - so we all know that Cardigan is set a few years after August and Betty. I feel like this line indicates that even though they didn't get back together, Betty probably still thinks about what-if she'd forgiven James? Would they still be together? Would she had been in his arms right now rather than constantly trying to erase his memories?

""I knew you TRIED to change the ending"" - they never got back together because Betty didn't trust him anymore. 'Tried' makes it clear that James did whatever he could to win Betty back. He did surprise her the party but she refused to take him back. 
And I think that made her loose alot of friends because people probably thought that James is so sweet that he went through all those lengths to make it up to Betty (this is because, in Cardigan Betty sounds REALLY lonely. I could clearly be wrong bout this tho). And I think the friends took his side because not many people at 17 would feel that much of regret for cheating. They probably accused Betty of throwing away their relationship.

And imo, the rest of the song is just Betty having flashbacks of all the memories and drowning with suffocation because she still loves him to this day.

And I think Augustine was a lil bit at fault too. She KNEW that James had a girlfriend and yet she went ahead for a fling with him because she had a crush on him. She KNEW it wasn't supposed to be serious but she ended up with genuine feelings which hurt alot. She thought she could change his mind but was heartbroken when realized that she can't. ""you were never mine"" makes it pretty clear that she knew what she was getting into. So we can't really victimize her completely whether she was virgin or not.

The lyrics ""I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired"" disgust me so much because it's pretty obvious that James only likes the chase. The thrill and new feeling of a relationship. He gets bored easily which is PATHETIC *eye rolls*


Now back onto the point I made this post for;
Well, I'm bit of an airhead and I made up my own version of what might have happened AFTER what the songs tell us.

James couldn't get Betty back which broke him. He was really hurt and shocked because his delusional self thought that crashing her party would be some sort of great apology and Betty and him would have a dramatic getting back together where they would kiss and everyone clapped (?) 
But that did not end up how he thought it would. So it crushed him.

We all know he was always a bit on the introverted side and this probably made him even more closed off from people. He must've cut off alot of friends and I like to think that he started working on himself. 
Stopped giving heed to this drama because Betty already changed her homeroom and he couldn't see her alot now anyway. Which probably helped ease the pain and I think he bought his grades up and got into a good college (maybe a lawyer types. Idk he seems to give me lawyer vibes for some reason lol üò≠).

Well, after a few years, I think he met Augustine again. He has since matured and became a better adult. He apologizes to her and she forgives him because she knew that she was at fault too. They both start hanging out more and eventually fall in love. But Augustine is scared to get hurt again.

They date a year or two and James is actually serious for her but when he tells his friends from home about her, he becomes a laughing stalk back in his town. People think this wouldn't last because they know about their history and they humiliate him. He gets a bit staggered by it and now is embarrassed of Augustine.


So now, I think question... ? suits them so well. Because I've had this theory in my mind forever (way before I listened to question... ?) And after I heard it, I immediately connected it with this. 
It could be a third person POV (like Inez?)
These verses fit so well: 

*""Can I ask you a question?
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
And every single one of your friends was
Making fun of you
But 15 seconds later they were clapping too?
Then what did you do?
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night?
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight?
When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch ...her?
It's just a question""*  


And the line
*""And what's that, that I heard, that you're still
with her, That's nice, I'm sure that's what's suitable""* , could be that awkward situation where all his friends realise that James had ACTUALLY changed for the better and isn't gonna leave Augustine. He doesn't wanna repeat his mistakes.

I never really gave thought about Betty's aftermath tho. I hoped she moved on too and fell in love with someone who loved her and treated her far better. She didn't deserve what James did to her.

3916,"So I came across this piece of evidence on Twitter and had never noticed it before or heard anyone mention it. In the Miss Americana documentary there is a part where they show an old video of Taylor singing Call It What You Want to someone.

https://youtu.be/gbgaTjZJq5k

At the 1:10 mark she points her foot at the person filming it who she is singing to and a clearly feminine voice which doesn‚Äôt sound like Taylor‚Äôs sings the line ‚ÄúI did one thing right‚Äù. Taylor mouths those words as the person sings it so I think it can throw people off if they aren‚Äôt paying attention, but if you listen closely you will realize it doesn‚Äôt sound like Taylor. Also at the 1:30 mark, you can hear the person recording say ‚Äúyes‚Äù and then Taylor mouths ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù. There‚Äôs a theory out there that the real lyrics in Call It What You Want are ‚ÄúKarlie would you want to‚Äù. I always thought this was a bit of a reach but WHY exactly would the person she is singing to randomly say ‚Äúyes‚Äù after the ‚Äúcall it what you want to‚Äù line? ü§® It‚Äôs not a question. And then to have Taylor react by mouthing ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù. It doesn‚Äôt make much sense any other way.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Gaylor_Swift/comments/13zcs9o/very_convincing_gaylor_evidence_in_the_miss/,Very convincing Gaylor evidence in the Miss Americana documentary that I don‚Äôt see many mention,Gaylor_Swift,t3_13zcs9o,/r/Gaylor_Swift/comments/13zcs9o/very_convincing_gaylor_evidence_in_the_miss/,2023-06-03 13:23:19,Taylor Swift

21423,"Best believe I'm still bejeweled, peeps, but sometimes, karma works in mysterious ways. The results for this album were interesting to say the least, like some weren't like Would've Could've Should've being the most voted answer, but a lot of the songs I expected to be in the top 5 were not and one that I expected to do less well than those did almost as well as Would've Could've Should've (or WCS), so without further ado, let's get into it.

In terms of the number of responses, I got 351 in total. Going from the youngest to oldest age demographic who answered, I got 11 votes from people 13 and younger, 41 from people 14 -18, 68 from people 19 - 25, 135 from people 26 - 32, 74 from people 33 - 40, 18 from people 41- 50, and 4 from people 51 or older, one being from someone 65 and older. It skewed a little older than I remember the previous surveys doing, like fewer people in my age demographic (19-25) in particular participated in the survey, but I'm happy with the turnout considering that I was lucky to get a couple of hundred people in total once I got closer to the debut survey. The most voted for song was, as I said, WCS with 19.1% of the votes or 67 votes. Following that was, believe it or not, You're On Your Own Kid with 14.2% of the vote or 50 votes. After that, you have Maroon with 44 votes (12.5%), It Hits Different with 40 votes (11.4%), and then you have The Great War with only 24 votes (or 6.8%), You're Losing Me with 17 votes (4.8%), Karma and Midnight Rain both with 15 votes (4.3%), Lavender Haze with 12 votes (3.4%), Sweet Nothing with 9 votes (2.6%), Vigilante Shit, Antihero, Mastermind, and Dear Reader with 7 votes (2%), High Infidelity with 6 votes (1.7%), Bejeweled with 5 votes (1.4%), Snow on the Beach with 4 votes (1.1%), Labyrinth, Bigger than the Whole Sky, and Paris with 3 votes (.9%), and lastly Question...?, Glitch, and Karma ft Ice Spice with 2 votes (.6%). A lot of songs I thought were fan favorites like midnight rain didn't do as well as I thought they would.

In terms of the different age demographics, people 13 or younger's top three answers were Hits Different (27.3%), and The Great War and You're On Your Own, Kid (each with 18.2%), and I do it that way because if I counted the third lower percentage as a ""third place"", everything else would be in third place with 9.1% of the vote or 1 vote each. People 14 through 18's top three were It Hits Different (17.1%), WCS, Karma, and The Great War (14.6% each), and You're On Your Own Kid (9.8%). People 19-25's top three were WCS (14.7%), YOYOK and It Hits Different (10.8% each), and Midnight Rain (8.8%). People 26-32's top three were WCS (20.7%), Maroon (17%), and YOYOK (14.8%). People 33-40 had the same top three except that YOYOK was in second and Maroon in 3rd (21.6%, 17.6%, and 13.5%). People 41-50's top three were the same as people 26-32's but with different percentages (27.8%, 22.2%, and 16.7% respectively). Above the age of 51, 2 people voted for WCS, one voted for Midnight Rain, and our oldest participant (65 or older) voted for YOYOK.

Something that occurs to me while looking at the differences in the age demographics is that I think it'd be interesting to not just looking at the percentage differences (i.e, what percentage of people in each age group voted for a specific song) but where it placed in that age group's list because sometimes the percentage will be bigger but it'll still place lower than another song. Then again, I'm lazy and I'm not sure how I would do it. However, even without doing that, some interesting trends showed up. For example, YOYOK's vote percentages fluctuated a little, but overall, it did get more popular with age (11.5% to 13.3% to 17.4% using the first three of the four more general demographic charts \[18 or Younger, 19 - 32, and 33-50, the percentage technically went up to 25% in the 51 or over demographic as well but considering that 25% is only one vote in that age demographic, it's probably not statistically significant\]). Maroon got more popular as well  using these same demographic charts (3.8% to 13.8% to 15.2%). Using my other generalized demographic charts (everyone younger than 25, people 26-40, and people 41 and over), the Great War did less well with age for some reason (10.8% to 4.8% to 4.5%). WCS went up a lot in popularity using these charts (13.3% to 21.1% to 31.8%) and using the other general demographic charts, same thing (11.5% to 18.7% to 22.8%). You're Losing Me went down in popularity (7.7% to 5.4% to 2.2%). Many of the songs fluctuate in popularity with each age group surveyed, even when looking at the more general demographic charts. For example, Sweet Nothing goes down in popularity pretty simply if I use the 25 and younger, 26-40, and 41 and older charts (4.2% to 1.9% to no votes respectively). Using the other three general demographics, however,  you go from no votes to 3.4% to 2.2%, though, so in general, there were trends but when looking closer or even when grouping the age demographics differently, the trends looked a little different. I hope you found some of this interesting and I'll put the graphs here along with sharing the Google Sheets like I usually do. Thanks for giving me such sweet nothings lol.

29487,"I was thinking about making a meme based on ""The Incredibles"" scene where Mr Incredible discovers Kronos program and how all superheroes have been systematically murdered. An example: https://youtu.be/r3fD5FPQBtI?si=__JcQC30VpIdJU0V

The meme would be to show Taylor's ability to fend of people trying to ruin her as well as little bit of poking fun at us for our natural cult behavior.

This one would be about people who tried to hurt Taylor's success but mostly hurt themselves, either because of Taylor fighting back or by something unrelated while Taylor hit back, leading to Taylor basically becoming the queen of America or something.

There are some obvious:

1. Kanye West, who took her moment during 2009 VMAs and later mentioning her in a song in a unflattering manner without permission. Now he's open about loving Hitler and mentally ill wreck of a former star.

2. Kim Kardashian, who stood by her hubby and attempted to ruin Taylor's reputation and credibility with edited phone call. Not sure if she fell from grace (if it can be called that), but haven't heard about her in a while and at least she divorced Ye.

3. Katy Perry who if I understood correctly, took Taylor's backup dancers when are needed them, leading to Bad Blood, leading to Katy being publicly obnoxious about it and responding with her own diss track, Swish Swish on a big flop of an album, Witness and went to sort of an obscurity afterwards.

4. Scott Borchetta, executive who founded her first label and then sold her masters against her wishes.

5. Scooter Braun, manager who bought her masters and whom Taylor always considered a bully.

6. COVID-19 - While obviously not a person, the pandemic forced her to cancel a tour of the time when she expected that her popularity is about to begin to wane due to her age, but she beat the expectation with wildly acclaimed Folklore and Evermore, helping her to get famous to an insane degree by showing her songwriting to people who otherwise wouldn't be fans.

7. Joe Jonas, I guess. I'm not well versed in her lonely Starbucks lovers, but I'm pretty sure that he in particular went into obscurity after he broke up with her via a brief phone call. So I guess he deserves to be included.

8. Ellen DeGeneres - She (as a person, not sure if her show too) was cancelled couple years back because she was revealed to be an utter narcissist who treats her crew and fans like trash. When she would invite Taylor for an interview, she would usually ask her very intrusive questions about her boyfriends  and it's sometimes theorized that she's a major reason why Taylor got a reputation of a serial dater who needs an ex to feel inspired.

Is there anyone else who didn't find much luck in dissing Taylor?",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/17xskn1/what_is_the_list_of_taylors_enemies_that_somewhat/,What is the list of Taylor's enemies that somewhat fell from grace?,TaylorSwift,t3_17xskn1,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/17xskn1/what_is_the_list_of_taylors_enemies_that_somewhat/,2023-11-17 23:37:58,Taylor Swift

30200,"There's something I feel journalists sometimes miss when they tell the ""Taylor Swift story"" (as in the recent Time article). TS was a very big star before 2020 with a very large fanbase, but it has gone to a different level in the last few years, as everyone recognizes. The stats are completely mindblowing (e.g. the stat about 31m people registering for the Toronto presale).

Why? How was TS able to transcend her existing fanbase like this, more than 10yrs into her career? To me a big part of this is the way that, when Covid-19 hit, TS turned her attention instantly to writing sad but uplifting songs of great empathy and sensitivity, in a way that captured the mood of those dark times. These songs brought comfort to many of us during a year of great suffering, a time when it seemed like all of our futures were on hold and in the balance. folklore and evermore are very special in that way. They would have been very good albums in any year, but they have a special significance because of when they were made and released.

People don't really like to talk about it now - it was so bad. Many of us have repressed a lot of the memories. And yet I think this great outpouring of affection and gratitude for TS now, in 2023, is linked quite directly to what she did for us in 2020.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/18czw69/taylor_swift_and_the_pandemic/,Taylor Swift and the pandemic,TaylorSwift,t3_18czw69,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/18czw69/taylor_swift_and_the_pandemic/,2023-12-07 16:52:48,Taylor Swift
15643,"Part of my Gaylor journey has been becoming more media astute. One of the things that really changed my perspective about Taylor (and celebs in general) was the realization that the paparazzi industry is nothing like it was 10+ years ago before social media and camera phones. Freelance paparazzi used to be able to make $$$$$ by doing all the stereotypical things we think of paparazzi doing: hiding in bushes, renting helicopters, killing Princess Diana, etc. Before social media, paparazzi photos were the main way the public knew what celebrities were up to, and it was *serious* money to get a good shot. But now, celebs give most of that information away for free through their own social media. The money has really dried up for freelance paparazzi, meaning a lot fewer people are choosing to make a living by following celebs around on the off-chance they can snag a photo to sell.  

But the public still has this *perception* that there are tons of paparazzi who are *constantly* stalking celebs, and they use that to their advantage to plant certain stories and still be able to turn around be like ""StOp InVadInG mY pRiVaCy."" Nowadays, 90% celebrity ""paparazzi"" photos we see are pre-arranged, staged, and fed to certain publications, often styled to look like accidents... or in Taylor's case, to encourage the media to connect the dots on certain lyrics. 

1) ""Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you"" - [Shop the look](https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/Taylor-Swift-Nike-Sneakers-Hike-Joe-Alwyn-44655916)!  
2) ""[You're the West Village](https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/taylor-swift-joe-alywn-walk-hand-in-hand-in-nyc/), You still do it for me babe""  Written about a man, obviously! 

&amp;#x200B;

[Two \\""paparazzi\\"" photo stunts done specifically to connect to lyrics](https://preview.redd.it/20jsycpfkfka1.png?width=1250&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2efe7582a7f946bf7f174752d918ff1777118d70)

In these these ""paparazzi"" photos from Turks &amp; Caicos in 2018 there are no security guards, no one else is on the beach, and there is literally an outfit change. üíÄ 

[2018, Turks &amp; Caicos. Photos released the same day as the trailer for \\""The Favourite\\""](https://preview.redd.it/4q37z91tmeka1.png?width=1934&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2eb09442785fb1187b491f37ccdf47308242dc82)

Here's a similar beach vacation stunt done in 2022, also using the same photo agency (BACKGRID), but just made to look a little more blurry so it's not *super* obvious they are staged. What's funny about this photo set is the amount of blurriness changes from photo to photo. If the photographer wanted to get a higher-res photo they definitely could, but that wasn't the assignment. We are supposed to feel like we are invading their privacy, because that is a juicier story to sell. 

[June 2022, Bahamas. Photos released the day before Taylor releases \\""Carolina.\\"" Joe is also promoting stuff at this time.](https://preview.redd.it/8lwnwpe0veka1.png?width=1694&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7c84e1b8b44417e38d46299e973b2bd7ec9650f0)

Paparazzi are not just hanging out in boats waiting for Taylor Swift to show up. Even if you want to believe that someone saw them and ""tipped off"" the paparazzi...like how would that scenario play out? Is there like a paparazzi hotline the average person knows how to call? Is there a freelance photographer located nearby who sees the bat signal and comes swooping in with a chartered boat and telephoto lens? And does that person know how to turn around and sell those photos to People Magazine? Does anyone believe that if Taylor Swift was on this private beach and saw a boat hovering offshore that she would kiss her bf in 12 different poses unless she wanted those photos to come out?

Taylor is seen when she wants to be seen, and not seen when she doesn't. Because we still have this media narrative that celebs are *constantly hunted by paparazzi everywhere*, the public is supposed to assume that if we are not seeing something it must not be happening. Because surely there would be photos right? There just is not a financial incentive for photographers to follow celebs around like they once did. So when people wonder how Taylor could secretly date women and we'd never get a photo of them together - yeah its very possible.

They live in a big house that's cold and dark. The man in ivy who Taylor's character cheats with, for some reason I picture as like a groundskeeper.

&amp;#x200B;

Album: **Fearless**

* This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town - ‚ÄúWhite Horse‚Äù

Album: **Speak Now**

Album: **RED**

* And it was like slow motion, standing there in my party dress - ‚ÄúThe Moment I Knew‚Äù *\[I know this one is a stretch, but it feels like this slow-motion filmy scene in my head :P\]*

Album: **1989**

* It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat, forevermore - ‚ÄúWelcome To New York‚Äù *\[Soundtrack ‚Üí Film. Another stretch, I know\]*
* You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye - ‚ÄúStyle‚Äù *\[Well, he was an actor\]*

Album: **reputation**

Album: **Lover**

* ‚ÄòCause cruelty wins in the movies - ‚ÄúThe Archer‚Äù

Album: **folklore**

* You know the greatest films of all time were never made - ‚Äúthe 1‚Äù
* I think I've seen this film before and I didn't like the ending‚Ä¶ So I‚Äôm leaving out the side door - ‚Äúexile‚Äù
* You're a flashback in a film reel on the one screen in my town - ‚Äúthis is me trying‚Äù
* You knew the hero died so what's the movie for? - ‚Äúhoax‚Äù

Album: **evermore**

* I can't make it go away by making you a villain - ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù  *\[I know it's not movie-specific but for storytelling in general but it seemed relevant\]*
* Motion capture put me in a bad light‚Ä¶ I rewind th–µ tape, but all it does is pause on th–µ very moment all was lost - ‚Äúevermore‚Äù

Album: **Midnights**

* It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero - ‚ÄúAnti-Hero‚Äù *\[See happiness\]*
* This scene feels like what I once saw on a screen - ‚ÄúSnow On The Beach‚Äù
* \[Spoiler for Hits Different\] This is why they shouldn't kill off the main guy",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/10lmrl8/film_references_in_taylor_swifts_music/,Film references in Taylor Swift‚Äôs music,TaylorSwift,t3_10lmrl8,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/10lmrl8/film_references_in_taylor_swifts_music/,2023-01-26 07:55:55,Taylor Swift

25059,"I think that's a Longshot because metal vocals require next level skills which I have no idea if Taylor possesses.

But I think that it would be wild if the biggest popstar in the world right now touched heavy metal. Even though it wouldn't have to be some extreme form or even traditional, but something like Evanescence for example.

If you don't know Metallica very well, their 2003 album, St. Anger is pretty much a cash grab attempt by pandering to Nu Metal community just at a time when it was dissolving. The album is generally considered their worst, although I like it. The title track music video features the band wearing silly clothes that evoke some modern rock band with members at their late 20s, when they were already around 40. Just some really drastic attempt at reinvention.

I'm mentioning to demonstrate that Taylor could try something similar.

4457,"So I've been ---[deep diving and reading the master posts](https://www.tumblr.com/swiftgronmasterpost/638244577767309313/late-stage-swiftgron-part-2-things-get-loud-with) of each person Taylor has been thought of as dating and I just got to April 20, 2018 which is when the song Babe came out. The tumblr says:   


>**April 20, 2018 - Babe (a song that Taylor wrote in the** ***Red*** **era) about a lover with shall we say ‚Äúcommitment issues‚Äù.**   
>  
>Later when the Babe music video is released people (even non Gaylors) notice that it is nearly a shot for shot remake of the I‚Äôm Not The Only One music video that Dianna starred in back in 2014.¬†  
>  
>What‚Äôs more psychotic is that the song Babe itself is only three minutes and 35 seconds long:  
>  
>But the music video has had a full minute and 4 seconds to it to **make it the** ***exact same length*** **as the I‚Äôm Not The Only One music video.**

they then add

> Another theory I‚Äôve been mulling over is the possibility¬†that Dianna and Taylor hooked up some time in 2018 prompting Taylor to paint herself as the other woman (as Dianna would be cheating on Winston making Taylor the other woman) in the mv.¬† There‚Äôs no hard evidence for it but it‚Äôs possible... 

Which got me thinking... It makes total sense that in the Babe MV, she's playing the other woman --- if she *had* planned to release it on *Red* and made a MV at that time... then she, most likely, would have been the one cheated on not the other woman. Meaning she'd be playing the role that Jennifer plays in the MV.  Which is what Dianna played in I'm Not The Only One.  
But, she didn't, she held off for whatever reason and instead gave it to Sugarland... So, it makes sense that she'd play the *other woman* since it's not her singing about ""it being the last time she'll call the person 'babe'"" (aka being the lead singer) instead, she provides the backup vocals and plays --- the other woman.   


Which meshes really well with the theory that maybe Dianna and Taylor hooked up when Dianna was with Winston (whether they were PR or not isn't the point here).  And maybe her choosing to make it basically a scene for scene copy was her way of reaching out to Dianna or processing the ending of their relationship?   


honestly idk it was just a thought that popped into my head and I can't seem to let the idea go so I wanted to share it.

Indiana man charged with stalking, threatening Taylor Swift after trying to meet singer on Eras Tour
Natalie Neysa Alund
USA TODAY

A 33-year-old Indiana man is facing charges including stalking and intimidation after authorities said he threatened violence after being denied access to his ""soulmate"" singer Taylor Swift.

Mitchell Taebel of Long Beach was booked into the LaPorte County Jail Friday after being arrested on charges of harassment, stalking, intimidation and invasion of privacy in connection to threats that began in March when the superstar Eras Tour kicked off in Glendale, Arizona, LaPorte County Sheriff's Office records show.

""On March 29, 2023, Taebel posted a voice message to his Instagram account that he sent to (Swift) official Instagram account stating that he would happily wear a bomb if he cannot be with his soul mate,"" a charging document obtained by local newspaper The Times of Northwest Indiana.

The next day, on March 30, Taebel left a message for Swift's father claiming to be her soulmate and on April 5, the warrant obtained continues, police wrote he sent her a picture on Instagram of someone firing a handgun at a gun range, the outlet reported.

Officials said Taebel threatened to ""destroy"" Swift and her dancers if she performed her song ""Vigilante (expletive)"" at a show, the outlet reported.

Police say on May 5 Taebel traveled to condominiums in Nashville where Swift has a home and was stopped in the lobby by security after entering through an unsecured door.

Metro Nashville Police Department spokesperson Don Aaron told USA TODAY Taebel showed up at the condo and ""said he was a reporter and wanted the staff to let Taylor Swift know he was single,"" according to the concierge who called police. 

Taebel fled the scene before officers arrived, Aaron said, and later that night, he was spotted at Nissan Stadium by security, escorted out, and banned from the venue.

Neither the LaPorte County Sheriff's Office nor a Swift representative could immediately be reached for comment Thursday morning.

5460,"""Cowboy Like Me"" is a great song but one I just haven't paid much attention to or have in my regular playlist rotation. I'm convinced it's about bearding and can't help but notice the last 40 secs of the song instrumental sounds EXACTLY like John Mayer's music. With all the Andy Cohen and John Mayer speculation lately, makes a lot of sense. I know a lot of people think it's about Dianna, Karlie or Lily which could also be true considering what the core of the song is about through this lens. I've listed some lyric interpretations below. *Go listen and pay attention to last 40 secs of the song, I was shook*

Like, obviously she can evolve and stuff, but in my opinion, the pandemic was the perfect opportunity to release old (or recent) songs that didn't made it to the final albums or that she didn't wanted to share with the public because it didn't made sense with her public situation (in a long-term relationship).

Additionally, I've always wanted to know and understand why people decided that some songs were about Joe but others are about fictional characters. Because if they want to hang on what she said about writing about others, they shouldn't defend to death that peace is about Joe and then get mad at people who says the love triangle is fiction. But then again, those of you who like to say that Betty, James and Augustine's songs aren't based on her personal experience, why do you believe the 1 is about Harry, when it fits in the love triangle story perfectly?

28008,"Something I noticed about every rerecording is that they always have that one vault track that the greater swiftie community instantly latches onto. To the point where the other four or five tracks, good or bad, are almost completely overlooked in favor of the one. 

The reason why ranges from ""It was such a great song I can't believe it didn't make the original album (Mr. Perfectly Fine)"" to  ""Closure to a long running fandom in-joke (ATWTMV)"" to ""Disbelief that sweet, innocent, teenage Taylor wrote a song this sexually charged (I Can See You)"".  And now it's happening again with 1989 TV and the song ""Slut!"", which we know *nothing* about beyond the title and the context of when it was written. 

So why does the fandom do this?

12593,"I personally am a fan of album era rollouts where singles are released before the album itself and have their own time to shine/chart/make an impact/leave their mark.

In the long run, I think this strategy creates memorable hits that people will remember an artist for (drivers license, deja vu, good 4 u and, most recently it seems, vampire) while also letting the other tracks on the album shine upon its release, rather than putting the whole album out at once which seems to have become the standard in the streaming era.  Based on the GUTS release date (sept 8) and the lead single release date (june 30), i think it‚Äôs safe to assume this album rollout will closely resemble SOUR‚Äôs format (lead single + second pre-release single +  third single at the same time as (or very close to) the album release).

22750,"So, um, I‚Äôm obsessed with Timeless, like it‚Äôs a problem, and I was listening and listening and made a connection that I‚Äôm pretty positive about.

If you haven‚Äôt had a chance to listen yet, the premise of Timeless is that Taylor stumbles into an antique shop (a storied pasttime of hers, obviously) and finds a bunch of old photographs of different couples and reflects on a relationship where she feels she and her lover would have found and loved each other in all different lifetimes and different circumstances. Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm obsessed with this concept too. But then I saw something interesting in the second chorus‚Ä¶

‚ÄúIn the fifteen hundreds off in a foreign land/
And I was forced to marry another man/
You still would‚Äôve been mine/
We would‚Äôve been timeless/
I would‚Äôve read your love letters every single night/
And run away and left it all behind/
You still would‚Äôve been mine/
We would‚Äôve been timeless‚Äù

24168,"Hey Swifties! This is me trying to convince y'all why Red is the best album and, basically, Taylor Swift's magnum opus. Even if you don't agree it's the best one (which is definitely understandable, because so many of her albums are exquisite), I want you to at least acknowledge how much artistic value it has. I can't express enough how much Red means to me. It's like stepping into a time machine that takes me back to those bittersweet days of my early 20s. Let me share why this album is an absolute masterpiece.

Red isn't just a collection of songs; it's a profound soundtrack that encapsulates the rollercoaster of emotions that come with entering adulthood. Each track feels like a chapter in my journey, where emotions are raw and right on the surface, waiting to burst forth. The color Red is used to describe intense passion, love, and heartache, which beautifully mirrors the vibrant emotions explored throughout the album. Taylor paints a vivid canvas of emotions, using red as a metaphor for the intense highs and lows experienced in relationships and life.

Let's talk about ""All Too Well"" (which is my favourite track on this album). This song is an emotional tour de force that leaves me spellbound. It's heartbreaking and a poignant reflection on love, loss, and the lingering pain that comes with moving on. My favourite part is right before the outro of the 10 minute version. I particularly cry when she sings:

""And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well""

Another highlight, in my opinion, is ""Begin Again"", which has this captivating essence of hope and new beginnings. The way Taylor reflects on moving forward after heartbreak is genuinely inspiring. It's a reminder that even after the storm, there's a glimmer of light, and love can bloom again like a beautiful spring day. It's the perfect closing track for the standard edition: after all the heartbreak and suffering caused by past love, she shows some optimism for the future, watching how it can all ""begin again"".

Let me also express my deep appreciation for ""State of Grace"": an anthemic burst of energy that fills me with a sense of invincibility. The combination of powerful instrumentals and Taylor's soaring vocals is electrifying. It's like a musical call to embrace life's uncertainties with open arms, and that's something I cherish deeply. And it sums up pretty much what will be the overall theme of the album: a love that is so ""breve and wild"" and such a ""ruthless game"" that she will ""never be the same"" again. It's all about discovering yourself through love.

Overall, Red is more than just music; it's a time capsule of emotions and experiences that resonate with anyone navigating the journey into adulthood. The album delves into the complexities of love, heartbreak, and the turbulent emotions that come with growing up. Taylor's artistic growth and genuine vulnerability in this album make it stand out like no other in her discography.

So, to all of you out there, do yourself a favor, relisten to Red and give it its proper flowers. It's a musical journey that'll take you back in time and help you appreciate the vibrant emotions that make life so beautifully chaotic. Enjoy the ride!",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/15cfkt4/why_red_is_taylor_swifts_magnum_opus_imo/,Why Red is Taylor Swift's Magnum Opus (imo),TaylorSwift,t3_15cfkt4,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/15cfkt4/why_red_is_taylor_swifts_magnum_opus_imo/,2023-07-29 01:42:35,Taylor Swift

12898,"First of all, i was able to verify the fact there's an estimated 21k signed (black) vinyls in US circulation - It's actually possible to check a products stock and previous stock with archive.org; a commenter with live updates on her merch said 7k per drop with 3 drops, which lines up with my research. The earliest we saw the picture she is signing was 68 days ago, it was definitely taken earlier but they've had to edit, print & ship it to her. Based off of this & when they start shipping lets say she's had about 80 days, that would mean she's signing 262 copies a day, and that is ONLY the US version of the Black GUTS Vinyl which is different from other things she has signed. Now add a giant load more for UK, Germany, Australia, whatever other stores & signed products they have.  
Second thing i found is [this](https://i.imgur.com/RHZJOer.jpg). The german store, to my knowledge, as of very recently, has changed all their signed insert cards to ""print"" except for the black version, which is the one being sold in the US and the one being questioned. They are also all being advertised differently for some reason.  
Thirdly, if you take a look at the description of any signed vinyl, across any of her stores, including this American one in question, it always says ""signed 12x12"" **print** insert."". I am clueless on anything Vinyl related so i might just be wrong here, but to my knowledge it should just say ""insert"" and not ""print insert""?

Some also said she wouldn't risk the legal consequences of false advertising, but i don't believe she has falsely advertised and i certainly don't believe there could ever be any legal consequences to it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OliviaRodrigo/comments/167pu7l/some_insight_on_the_signed_vinyls_situation/,Some Insight on the Signed Vinyls Situation,OliviaRodrigo,t3_167pu7l,/r/OliviaRodrigo/comments/167pu7l/some_insight_on_the_signed_vinyls_situation/,2023-09-02 01:57:04,Olivia Rodrigo

But I haven't seen people talking about songs or albums they think are overrated, and I'm interested to see people's opinions.

I personally think ""Cowboy Like Me"" is overrated. Don't get me wrong. It's a beautiful song lyrically... I love the story it tells, and it has some beautiful lines. I'm a poet, and I'd LOVE to be able to tell a story like that with my writing. It's also great musically. (I'm in for any song Aaron Dessner does with her!) But the fandom seems to be OBSESSED with this song, and I just don't get the hype beyond it being just good, and it's often a skip for me.

15712,"So I think most people on this sub agree that Taylor is probably either bisexual or a lesbian and has been purposely ambiguous with her sexuality because she doesn't want to lie and say she's straight, but she also doesn't want to come out (for a variety of reasons that are valid and I would never criticize someone for not being ready to come out.)

But let's say that Gaylor gets bigger and bigger (like it already is) and it gets to the point where it's a very mainstream idea, mentioned in articles and interviews and stuff like that. She would feel like she *had* to address it at that point, right?

So far, she's avoided explicitly saying that she's heterosexual or only into guys. But if she was asked specifically, do you think she would ever explicitly say she's straight (knowing that she's not - essentially, *dishonestly* identifying as straight, for the same reasons that she hasn't felt able to come out yet?)

Or do you think if she was gay but not ready to come out, she would refuse to answer or say it was private or something like that?

If she said tomorrow that she's a hetero woman but she's always been a strong LGBT ally, how would you react to that? Would you take her at her word and just think that's the end of it? Or would you think that she's just not in a place where she can come out (for whatever reasons)?

(I was just thinking about this bc I've seen some discussion lately on whether she's gay or bisexual and how if she ever does identify with one of those labels, people should let it be and not speculate or question her on it, but just accept it. Would this also go for if she said she was straight? Or would you think there's a possibility she's purposely misidentifying for some reason?)",https://www.reddit.com/r/GaylorSwift/comments/1207cno/would_taylor_ever_dishonestly_come_out_as/,Would Taylor ever *dishonestly* come out as heterosexual?,GaylorSwift,t3_1207cno,/r/GaylorSwift/comments/1207cno/would_taylor_ever_dishonestly_come_out_as/,2023-03-24 03:14:59,Taylor Swift

The guidelines are: 
1. No covers of Taylor songs from other artists.
2. All genres/artists are welcome, as long as they are AT LEAST relatively known. No obscures, please.

5384,"So I think most of us agree this song is about Dianna despite the obvious Haylor bait, but I saw this new interpretation of the lyrics from the outro and I think it makes a lot of sense (sorry if this has been said, I haven't seen it)

*I don't have to pretend I like acid rock
or that i'd like to be on a mega-yacht
with important men who think important thoughts*

I saw from a Twitter Gaylor that this could be referring to her beards during Swiftgron. Harry could be the person who's into niche rock genres, and Connor Kennedy makes a lot of sense for the ""important men who think important thoughts"" line since she was dating him during a political campaign of his dad. So basically shes saying that one of the good sides of not talking to Dianna anymore is that she doesn't have to bear the weight of her beards anymore and pretending to be interested in them.

The printing, especially for the letters, seems spotty and very granulated. It wasn't the bright full red that was displayed in the website. 

I'm scared to open the package because I now have intentions to return the crewneck, which is SO unfortunate. This pose along with its visuals was jaw-dropping to see bc it's ABSOLUTELY ICONIC...

This podcast is done by author Caroline O'donoghue and while always a great and funny pod, I wanted to share her Midnights episode because I think she and her cohost have some interesting takes. One issue with it is not acknowledging the Scooter Braun/Scott Borchetta of it all on Vigilante Shit but otherwise I think its great. She also has an older episode devoted to Taylor Swift but it pretty general.

23066,"Hi everyone! Recently, I've been having fun messing around the sequencing of certain albums. My name's Cat, so as silly tongue-in-cheek joke, I've been dubbing them ""Cat's Versions"". One of the first ones I did was with *folklore*, since I had always had a couple issues with it, as well as a couple of ideas I wanted to try out.

First, here's the track list for *folklore* (Cat's Version):

1. the 1
2. exile
3. the last great american dynasty
4. mirroball
5. my tears ricochet
6. seven
7. this is me trying
8. illicit affairs
9. invisible string
10. hoax
11. epiphany
12. cardigan
13. august
14. betty
15. peace

Here's what I changed, and why I did:

1. **I made ""peace"" the last song.** Before, it was the penultimate song, with the closer being ""hoax"". This is something that has always bugged me. Comparing the two, ""hoax"" is much more bitter, while ""peace"" is much sweeter, both musically and lyrically. So I thought that ""peace"" would leave the listener with a nicer taste in their mouth. Initially, I just switched the two, but I later changed that.
2. **I put the love triangle songs (""cardigan"", ""august"", and ""betty"") to be one after another, almost like a suite of songs.** This is probably my biggest and favorite change I made. I thought that putting them together would really bring out the strength in the songwriting on the three songs, and would make the climax at the end of ""betty"" hit even harder. I decided to add the other two songs just before ""betty"", keep them in the order they were already in, and put them in between ""hoax"" and ""peace"" (the new closer). I liked the idea of the suite being the climax of the album. To me, the best thing about this album is Taylor leaning on her strengths as a songwriter and a storyteller, so having these three songs, which display that in full force and as the main focus, makes sense here. The key change, final chorus, and ending to ""betty"" also makes a great musical climax in my opinion. After this, ""peace"" makes for a great comedown, and a nice close to the album.  I honestly think it might even be cool to have them all as one Paul McCartney-esque medley, with the each song fading into the next song, and having it just be one long track titled like ""cardigan/august/betty"". This version of the album would then have 13 songs, which is Taylor Swift's lucky number (if you're this is making you realize that there's a song or two missing, I'll get to that later).
3. **I ditched ""mad woman"".** I'm sure this will be controversial, but I just don't like this song, and it has the added bonus of making a long album just a little bit shorter. The standard version of *folklore* is 63 minutes, which is (typical for Taylor Swift) a pretty lengthy listen. In my opinion, generally speaking, the longer an album needs to be, the stronger each song needs to be to warrant its place. I thinks it speaks to the quality of the rest of the songs here that there's really nothing else I would cut, even as someone who typically prefers shorter albums. The only other song here I don't like is ""cardigan"". If it didn't tie into ""cardigan"" and ""betty"", I'd have no qualms about cutting it, but with those two, it absolutely has to stay.
4. **I moved ""exile"" to song 2.** This was really just because I really didn't want ""the last great american dynasty"" to be song 2, which it would be with ""cardigan"" moved towards the end. Having an album as lowkey as *folklore* start with two of its most upbeat songs felt really weird. I thought having ""exile"" as the second song kept the pace closer to the original.
5. **I switched ""my tears ricochet"" and ""mirrorball"".** This was just to keep ""my tears ricochet"" as the 5th song, which Taylor has always said is where she puts her most emotional song.

And finally, here are some other things of note:

1. On these projects, I sometimes like to add in non-album singles from the around the same time, bonus tracks, or in the case of Taylor Swift, Vault tracks. The only song I thought made sense to add was ""the lakes"", but I ultimately decided to keep it off. It's not a bad song, but I just didn't feel like it really fit.
2. With ""cardigan"" being moved down, ""seven"" is now the longer the 6th song, and not the 7th. I thought the name of the song being the same as its position on the track list was really cute and I tried really hard to keep it, but I couldn't really find a way to make it work. Ultimately though, I figured that the song's new position plus its title (6+7) is 13, and I think that coincidence is a decent enough substitution.
3. Song 13 is now ""august"" and not ""epiphany"". I know that Taylor often puts careful consideration into what she makes the 13th song on an album, so I felt a little awkward changing it, especially considering how emotional and powerful ""epiphany"" is. I know that ""august"", despite being a great song, may seem like a lackluster replacement for such an important position, however I kind of like the idea of the 13th song landing right in the middle of the pseudo-suite.

TLDR; Reddit is gonna kill off 3rd party apps

Not sure how many of you are active on other subreddits or on Reddit overall, but the recent API changes/announcements are a huge deal. For many people, including myself, I use Reddit on 3rd party apps exclusively. I don‚Äôt use Reddit on my computer because I usually doom scroll on it and the official app is not functional in comparison. 

What does this mean for r/taylorswift? It means that there may be a significant drop in users. I don‚Äôt know the numbers because I am not a mod, but just a regular lurker. However, I do know that I will be quitting Reddit (and this sub) if I can‚Äôt use Apollo anymore because I will have no way to use this app. 

Anyways I just wanted to see what you all think, since this sub is THE place I go to for Taylor updates and discussions. Twitter is a cesspool and I don‚Äôt use tiktok.

30703,"Maybe I‚Äôm just slow, but I realized that Taylor released the TV songs prior to their re-recordings release to test how swifties would react to change in producers. Lemme explain:

Love Story TV: the first re-recorded song to be released, and the one to show how the country songs will sound since Nathan Chapman couldn‚Äôt return for them. 

You All Over Me: shows how Aaron Dessner will be the first main producer for the vault songs.

Mr. Perfectly Fine: shows how Jack Antonoff will be the second main producer for the vault songs. 

Wildest Dreams TV: shows how Chris Rowe will produce the Max Martin pop songs going forward since he won‚Äôt be returning. 

This Love TV: shows how Chris Rowe will produce the Nathan Chapman pop song since, again, he won‚Äôt be returning. 

Taylor isn‚Äôt releasing singles based on the popularity they will gain, she is releasing them to test the waters, which explains how there wasn‚Äôt any singles released prior to Speak Now and Red. And no, I am not including the droplet songs at the beginning of the eras tour because we already got the albums they‚Äôre on.

Edit: I also forgot Elvira, since she did the Love Story remix and was the secondary producer for a few of the songs, like Girl At Home and Message In A Bottle, so the remix was also released to show her off.

It's kind of fucking wild to me that mine got locked because I was very deliberate with my words and presented a really well balanced argument in my opinion. I was just stating that the fandom has become super polarized and toxic, and that the most extreme gaylors have created a bad reputation which just makes people make generalizations and assumptions any time you talk about queer stuff in a swiftie space.

28219,"Hi fellow Swifties! I hope everyone is having a wonderful time here!

I've recently been listening to a lot more folklore, and I was thinking about the trio of songs featuring our lovely (well, not James) three characters (for those of you new Swifties, these songs are cardigan, august, and betty).

I always pictured the three characters looking certain ways, and was curious if Taylor ever said anywhere how she pictures them. I looked around and couldn't find anything, but figured it would be interesting to find out what you all picture! Of course these are just what I envision and may not be right, but that's why I'm here to discuss!

**Betty:** Betty is petite, pale, with shoulder-length curly honey blonde hair (think loose ringlets rather than tight curls). She has large eyes and in my opinion I think they're brown or green. I also feel like she might be a dancer. Her friends of course told her to drop James and not give him another chance (hence ""all your stupid friends"" from the song betty), and I feel like one of them managed to find Augustine on social media so Betty knows what she looks like.

**Augustine:** Sort of the opposite of Betty. Average height, thin, and more of an edgy vibe. Black lipstick, tan (think olive skin tone, I also get Latina vibes from her), long straight dark brown hair, dark brown eyes. I also feel like the beach wasn't her favorite place, but meeting James made her feel like it just might be. 

**James:** Average height, slightly built, green eyes, messy light brown hair (think like, Tom Holland style, but like three shades lighter and more hanging in front of his face).

To be a flight risk is to be likely to leave. It‚Äôs a term mostly used to describe criminals and medical patients. Taylor brilliantly employs the phrase to describe her own behavior in romantic situations. She has a fear of falling (in love) because she doesn‚Äôt want to get hurt. She had a history of leaving someone before they could leave her.


Describing avoidant attachment has never been more poetic. The wordplay leads us to visualize her flying while being scared to fall from the sky, but it‚Äôs about fear and love.

15918,"Hi all! It occurred to me the other day when a friend pointed out that ""Suburban Legends"" is a pun on ""urban legends,"" that these two are essentially synonyms? As in, an urban legend is one kind of folklore.

I go back and forth on whether i think SL relates closer to Swiftgron or Kaylor? And I think regardless of muse it feels very queer. But here's some of the links I see to each:

*Swiftgron*

* 1989 being largely, imo, a Swiftgron album
* Taylor's Sagittarius vs. Dianna's Taurus being *literally* mismatched star signs (direct opposites on the zodiac wheel). Though I also think this line could be interpreted as ""star"" meaning celebrity, as in, they are both famous, conventionally attractive women, who are not *supposed* to be queer under the rules of our culture, which also fits regardless of muse, I think.
* The way their personas -- Taylor fixed in culture as a kind of perpetual teenage girl, most known by the casual listener for her high school-core songs, especially when 1989 was still being written, an Dianna being most known for playing a fictional suburban high schooler -- are so embroiled in suburbia) 
* I've always read ""the 1"" as about Dianna, and there's something so heartbreaking about going from ""You'd be more than a chapter in my old diaries"" to ""It would've been fun, if you would've been the 1""
* ""I didn't come here to make friends"" also definitely fits into Dianna being part of Taylor's friend group, her being in the liner notes among Taylor's other friends in ""22,"" plus all the best friends language in ""Maroon"" (which I've also always thought could be read as either a Swiftgron or Kaylor song, but all the references to the Red era always pushed me closer to a Dianna reading).

*Kaylor*

* The themes in this song feel *so* kaylor to me - ""you were so magnetic it was almost obnoxious"" has so much of ""gold rush"" and ""lover"" in it. See: ""I take this magnetic force of a man to be mine""/ ""Everybody wants you / everybody wonders what it would be like to love you""
* The early timeline (""when you told me we'd get back together"" seems to match Ed's lyrics in ""End Game"" if you interpret them as being from taylor's pov  - ""knew you when we were young, we reconnected when we were a little bit older,
* ""You'd be more than a chapter in my old diaries"" matches taylor seeing karlie as a more longterm or even forever love, see: ""is this is the end of all the endings?"" in King of My Heart)
* ""Class reunion"" language -- the way the Victoria's Secret Fashion Shows literally used ""[Class of 2013](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/victoriassecret/images/f/f6/Class2013.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20171111191407)"" etc. type language each year.
* ""I dash to the door / you don't knock anymore"" I think you could read as connected to a lot of Kaylor themes around them living together. i.e.: ""Hits Different"" - ""Is that your key in the door?,"" how much being at home factors into songs like ""Lover"" and ""Paris.""
* ""We were born to be national treasures"" / ""we were born to be suburban legends"" feels *so* close to ""End Game"" - ""Big reputations, big reputations, ooh you and me would be a big conversation""
* ""I didn't come here to make friends"" is *so,* ""I don't want you like a best friend"" / ""What if I told you none of it was accidental, and the first night that you saw me I knew I wanted your body"" coded.
* ""And you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever"" feels so related to ""you left me no choice but to stay here forever"" / ""you and me forevermore"" / ""look at this godforsaken mess that you made me""

And then outside of any muse, I just think the idea of *being* suburban legends itself feels *so* queer. That's why, imo, they're specifically *suburban* legends as opposed to the typical term of *urban legends* on what is known as *the* New York City album. Because they are legends in suburbia, a place where the kind of love they have couldn't otherwise exist. ""Welcome to New York"" specifying ""and you can want who you want, boys and boys and girls and girls,"" implicitly carries that *outside* of New York / other cities, you cannot do that.

And I think this also fits in with the idea of the general ennui and dislike that exists in a lot of Taylor's work around the idea of suburbia / small town culture:

* YOYOK: ""I didn't choose this town / I dream of getting out""
* ""Mean: ""Someday I'll be living in a big old city \[...\] Someday I'll be big enough that you can't hit me""
* ""Fifteen"": ""We'll be out of here as soon as we can.""
* ""High Infidelity:"" ""Your picket fence is sharp as knives""
* The entire story of ""tis the damn season"" and ""dorothea"" tbh
* Large parts of ""folklore"" taking place in a small town / suburban setting: ""betty"" and ""august"" having explicitly suburban settings, with front porches, malls, etc, ""seven"" taking place in Taylor's childhood home, etc.

So, given how queer ""folklore"" and ""evermore"" are as albums, and how much it feels as though Taylor's queer relationships are being filtered through that lens -- I could give examples but I think we'd be here all day and also like, the way her queer history refracts through all of folkmore feels really well-documented -- I wonder if ""Suburban Legends"" could be considered a kind of tongue-in-cheek reference by current Taylor + a kind of accidental premonition from the Taylor of 10 years ago:

That is, the idea that, whoever the muse, they were *literally* born to be ""suburban legends."" As in, their relationship was born to one day be interpreted in the album ""folklore"", and into the folklore of Taylor's career.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GaylorSwift/comments/17lkryg/suburban_legends_folklore/,suburban legends + folklore,GaylorSwift,t3_17lkryg,/r/GaylorSwift/comments/17lkryg/suburban_legends_folklore/,2023-11-01 19:59:02,Taylor Swift

6188,"Welcome back to Fight Club featuring the Bad Blood crew. Today we say good-bye 5 of our fighters as we head into our Wild Card round.

While the fights took place, Welvin Da Great was off looking into The Headmistress in an effort to determine her special ability. The information he gathered is that her name is also her title as she oversee a specialized school for junior vigilantes. In fact, one of her graduated prodigies is none other than The Trio! As for her special ability, Welvin was able to procure her application for the Headmistress position which states: can spot an enemy‚Äôs weakness upon initial interaction.

The fights were fierce as the winners from last round compete for their spot in the semi-finales. Arsyn arrived to her fight in top form and continues her streak with another glorious victory securing her place along with Luna and Cut Throat (MVP) as the winners of their fights. Each of them has been granted a week off to prepare for the next fight.

Over at our battle between the previous round losers, all of our ladies brought the the heat. Most of them weren't ready to leave for good and their scores show it. Yet there can only be two in our Wild Card round and they are‚Ä¶ Headmistress and Homeslice.

https://preview.redd.it/ay1cmyhro4ua1.jpg?width=496&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f1fff04ade23af6ee717751ff2d17398846e9a85

This week they will compete for the final spot in the semi-finales. Will Headmistress‚Äôs special ability be enough to save her from all of the hidden blades. Can Homeslice take down Headmistress quickly enough that their weakness won‚Äôt matter?

Taylor Durden steps into the ring, Headmistress and Homeslice shake hands and step back to their corners, and Taylor steps off as the fight begins with the gong of a bell.

Let the games begin.

I'll start with some of my own: 

\- A collab with another artist (within the kpop sphere or the west) 

\- Some more variety show appearances 

\- Hopefully a full album of atleast 10 songs (I BEG üò≠üò≠) 

\- Longer songs with bridges because the jeanies have majestic vocals (side note: do we have a collective name for the girls yet? If not, ""jeanies"" is my formal submission)

\- Attending and being nominated at more major US award shows (e.g VMAs) 

\- Even more daesangs, PAKS and other record-breaking achievements in SK

\- A WORLD TOUR (pls come to the UK)

\- And this last one might be a bit too ambitious but a grammy nom? (a girl can dream üòå)

[Part 2 ](https://reddit.com/link/16az2qg/video/5dtuxox8uhmb1/player)

I won't go too into how the dancers could be seen as fruity men and bearding as that's all been said. I do find it interesting that 3 of them are working on a contract when she walks in and the rest get in line behind the one holding the contract. 

The "" getaway car"" scene in the background visuals on tour  featured a specific  Jaguar E-Type  and surprising was never featured in a bond film but in a James Bond Spoof.  I always wondered why Taylor had 8 background dancers in tuxedo jacket scrambling in line  behind her. The suits are giving bond vibes and the  radio cell are giving Brosner vibes. 

The spoof parody James Bond film in 1967 Casino Royale  ( not Casino Royale in 2008 with Daniel Craig ) narrative was an older Bond enlisting 7 more bonds "" to confuse enemies and audience of who the real Bond was ""  ... Sound familiar? There was a scene with a female James  bond lining up potential new Bonds and picked him based on how he looked on paper.  For this Bond in the movie his next test was to not be able to be seduced by women as his power.

The film is widely known to be a trainwreck as it had 12 writers , 5 directors including Woody Allen who also played ""Jimmy Bond"" , 8 seperate  James Bond plots that had nothing to do with each other. However the biggest success of the film was they had Dusty Springfield sing 'The Look of Love "" created for the  theme song for the film . The song is so immortal that  it was used  again for the real Casino Royale Bond movie with Daniel Craig ( which was his first film in the franchise.)    It's clear Taylor Swift is influenced by Dusty Springfield especially in Reputation but to represent her in that scene never made sense till you look at them as mocking a James bond scene.  I'm not entirely sure if she's mocking Tom's ambitions or the Media speculation on his ambitions dating Taylor to get noticed for a Bond Role. ...

26053,"I  just had this epiphany, and it‚Äôs something I want to bring up for discussion. Though Taylor started off in country and was influenced by that, I have this inkling that she was also heavily influenced by 2000s punk-pop music. I‚Äôm the same age as Taylor, and as I reflect on her music and songwriting skills, it feels very reminiscent of the 2000s punk-pop music that we both grew up listening to.

She collaborated with Panic! At The Disco‚Äôs lead man, Brendon Urie, and her friend Abigail made a comment along the lines of ‚ÄúTaylor and I used to listen to PATD in high school and now he‚Äôs a feature on ME!‚Äù. And most recently she‚Äôs collaborated with Fall Out Boy on Speak Now TV.

I just listened to Taking Back Sunday‚Äôs song ‚ÄúCute Without the E‚Äù (which came out in 2002) and the structure of that song & songwriting reminds me of Taylor‚Äôs. The bridge alone is classic Taylor. Here‚Äôs the lyrics:

‚ÄúHoping for the best just hoping nothing happens
A thousand clever lines unread on clever napkins
I will never ask if you don't ever tell me
I know you well enough to know you'll never love me‚Äù

It then repeats in the background with new lyrics over it. As I was listening I just thought how the crafting of this song felt so similar to Taylor‚Äôs song crafting skills.

Another song is ‚ÄúFlavor Of The Week‚Äù by American Hi-Fi (which came out in 2001). It gives major You Belong With Me vibes. The story telling, the perspectives of the characters, and the themes are like right on point.

It‚Äôd be fun to have a discussion about this and see what you all think. Especially the perspectives of my fellow swifties who are nearing their mid-30‚Äôs and grew up listening to this music at the same time Taylor did!",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/1634r15/the_2000s_punkpop_musics_influence_on_taylor/,The 2000s punk-pop music‚Äôs influence on Taylor,TaylorSwift,t3_1634r15,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/1634r15/the_2000s_punkpop_musics_influence_on_taylor/,2023-08-27 22:49:41,Taylor Swift

I remember when Midnights came out, there were a lot of people who were disappointed with what it sounded like because they were spoiled by some of the most lyric-heavy and critically acclaimed albums of her career (Folklore and Evermore), even though in hindsight I think a good case could be argued that Midnights is her best pop album.

19268,"I never thought that Maroon is about Joe when she released Midnights, but a few days ago I was out in the evening and I saw how the sky turned red (maroon) after sunset and I immediately thought of this song. In the booklet of the original Red album (2012) Taylor writes this:

‚ÄùMy experiences in love have taught me difficult lessons, especially my experiences with crazy love. The red relationships. The ones that went from zero to a hundred miles per hour and the hit a wall and exploded. And it was awful. \[‚Ä¶\] And there‚Äôs something to be proud of about moving on and realizing that real love shines golden like starlight, and doesn‚Äôt fade or spontaneously combust. Maybe I‚Äôll write a whole album about that kind of love if I ever find it. \[‚Ä¶\] But most of all, this record is about love that was red.‚Äù

I think around 2019 Taylor thought that she found the golden kind of love with Joe and she wrote the song Daylight about golden love:

‚ÄúI once believed love would be burning red  
But it's golden  
Like daylight‚Äù

However, it turned out that her love with Joe was not the golden kind of love. Like after sunset, the sky turns maroon. It was not red, because it was stronger and deeper then red loves. But it was not golden either. Her love with Joe was not red love and not golden love, but something in between. It was maroon.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/12v4fyh/new_interpretation_after_the_breakup_maroon_is/,New interpretation after the break-up: Maroon is about Joe,TaylorSwift,t3_12v4fyh,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/12v4fyh/new_interpretation_after_the_breakup_maroon_is/,2023-04-22 12:25:56,Taylor Swift
16224,"My favorite little moment in the TSCU (Taylor Swift Cinematic Universe) that I rarely see discussed on here is the cheeky little nod to Tim McGraw in Cowboy Like Me. The guitar riff from Tim Mcgraw was interpolated into Cowboy Like me, thus connecting the two songs together for me. This has inspired me to connect some of the lyrics of both of these songs. 

Tim Mcgraw is one of those classic ""he vs. you"" songs us gaylors have all come to love. ***""I was right there beside him all summer long...But when you think Tim McGraw, I hope you think of me.""*** I like the distinction that it's not just the music of Tim McGraw, but the entire essence of who Tim McGraw is and what he represents: someone who writes songs about loving women. The you in this song could be the actual muse, while the boy in the Chevy truck might actually be a narrative tool to distract, possibly her first bait and switch. And of course, ***""I hope you think that little black dress, think of my head on your chest, and my old faded blue jeans.""*** The subject of this song is most likely the one wearing the black dress, because why would the narrator reference those two separate articles of clothing in the same visual? 

***""I've got some tricks up my sleeve, takes one to know one, you're a cowboy like me""*** Who else do we know that is a cowboy? Tim McGraw. It's so blatantly obvious that the narrator is referring to themselves as a man in both of these songs. 

Now why does it matter if these songs are connected? To me, they paint a bigger picture. I have actually talked about my belief in Theylor on this sub before - a belief that Taylor may be gender fluid or just existing outside of the binary. These songs prove my point. Taylor refers to herself as a cowboy in more than one song. ***""Telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear.""*** This song is famously discussed as a bearding song and while I do agree with that analysis, I could easily see this line referencing the idea that Taylor may be lying to the world about her true identity. She's just like yeah I'm a cis straight woman, only if you pay me for it (go off capitalist monarch!). 

I hope all of you who read this keep an open mind, obviously this is just one gender fluid person's interpretation of our favorite queer person's music, I am not stating it as law! Love you all <3",https://www.reddit.com/r/GaylorSwift/comments/18na076/when_you_think_tim_mcgraw_i_hope_you_think_of_the/,"When You Think Tim McGraw, I Hope You Think of the Cowboy Like Me",GaylorSwift,t3_18na076,/r/GaylorSwift/comments/18na076/when_you_think_tim_mcgraw_i_hope_you_think_of_the/,2023-12-21 00:42:33,Taylor Swift

One of her complaints (I guess) is that the lyrics can be a little broad-based and not entirely specific. While I disagree, I'm not sure if perhaps I'm not seeing something that she is (or the other way around). 

So, what are the most specific Taylor Swift songs about particular feelings? I guess Enchanted would be a good example about meeting someone for the first time.

16902,"Which of the love triangle girls do you think endured the most?

Follow up question: Is James a bad guy or just a kid who made mistakes?

August:
I saw someone bring up how lines are repeated in August, ‚Äúremember when I pulled up and said get in the car‚Äù because Augustine only had small moments with James which she repeats in her mind. While in Cardigan each verse has different lines because Betty knew every part of James. ‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt mine to lose‚Äù, August knew James‚Äô heart belonged to Betty. The pain of knowing someone you really loved was never truly yours. August couldn‚Äôt fully let herself be sad because she felt like it wasn‚Äôt her place. She felt like she had to be the cool girl who wasn‚Äôt too attached. But she was emotional and in love deep down. August and Betty had different types of heartbreak. The pain of longing for something more and never knowing, ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äôs‚Äù. All she had to hold onto was their summer love. The pain of knowing what she loved was never really hers in the same way that she was his. August felt like second choice, never living up to James‚Äô ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù Betty.

Betty:
Even though her and James were together in the end, this was a long burn of a heartbreak. Betty clearly has always had some insecurities. After all, she felt like an ‚Äúold cardigan‚Äù. Being with James made her feel whole, not ‚Äúold‚Äù but young and in love. ‚ÄúPlaying hide and seek and giving me your weekends‚Äù, she felt alive around James and he brought out her inner child. Betty was a smart and mature girl who whole heartedly loved James. James was the immature, going and messing around with August. ‚ÄúPeter losing Wendy‚Äù, James is Peter, the one who hasn‚Äôt grown up, Betty is Wendy, the wiser mature one. And she always KNEW. Betty knew James like the back of her hand. She knew when she was falling deeply in love with James that it was gonna be her biggest heartbreak. She knew they would still be together in the end. But she had to watch him leave and be with another girl. And she still loved him just as much, that‚Äôs true love.
I think of when Taylor said in an interview, ‚ÄúI think true unconditional love is like‚Äî do you love someone so much that you would even love them if they didn‚Äôt love you anymore.‚Äù",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/10iflaa/comparing_betty_and_augusts_experience/,Comparing Betty and August‚Äôs experience,TaylorSwift,t3_10iflaa,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/10iflaa/comparing_betty_and_augusts_experience/,2023-01-22 09:17:22,Taylor Swift

I can see that the publicity team wants us to think that Joe skipped the Grammy‚Äôs but partied all night with Taylor at the after party. There are no photos of them together at the after party, just the pic of Taylor in his jacket, which is weird, and most of us on this sub don‚Äôt think he was present at the after party. Were the jacket and the statement PR stunts to quash breakup rumors?

That said, if he is a beard, why wouldn‚Äôt he show up to the party for networking reasons? But if he‚Äôs not a beard, it‚Äôs still clearly beneficial for him, career-wise, to be with Taylor &amp; show up to events with her.

Whether he‚Äôs a beard or not, his absence is odd. Personally, I‚Äôm more of a homebody &amp; not a party person. The after party pics make give me secondhand social anxiety. I would probably skip the after party! But acting is not my line of work. 

I saw some speculation on this sub that Taylor may be trying to emulate Dolly Parton‚Äôs private marriage. If that‚Äôs the case, then Taylor isn‚Äôt doing it right. If Toe is so private, why does the publicity team have to keep TELLING us how private they are? Wouldn‚Äôt we be able to infer that from their actions alone? Why keep bringing him up in statements?

This is all to say - I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre real or not. But the mixed messages are confusing.

PS, I just can‚Äôt get over that her LH ‚Äúlove song‚Äù is an anthem about how she wants people to stop asking if she and her long term partner are going to get married. If you are so in love with your partner of 6 years, then why not marry?

PPS- I would buy the relationship more if Joe was an ordinary, non celebrity dude.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GaylorSwift/comments/10x8as9/toe_observations_a_ramble/,Toe observations - a ramble,GaylorSwift,t3_10x8as9,/r/GaylorSwift/comments/10x8as9/toe_observations_a_ramble/,2023-02-08 19:29:43,Taylor Swift

Anyways, I absolutely love the surprise songs she plays on tour.

29634,"Rep tour was 63 shows and that was sort of her comeback tour where she wasn‚Äôt sure if the fans would turn out. I went to Rep and I  remember those tickets being competitive and we def paid hundreds for upper bowl seats. 

 I remember being shocked in 2019 when she announced only 4 US dates for Lover. I lived in one of the two cities she was touring so I arranged with two different friends to go for tickets and ended up with lower bowl tickets for about $300 N1 and $59 (!!!!!) nosebleed upper bowl tickets for N2. Obviously that was pre-Covid and Taylor is def more popular for a bunch of reasons but she was still MASSIVE. 

The eras tour started out with ~70+ dates for the US alone, now 150 with the added dates, and it‚Äôs been a bloodbath with a lot of fans upset especially before she added additional dates.

Even though I was a fan, I feel like I wasn‚Äôt in the TS fandom as much during the lover era, was Taylor only having 4 US dates more controversial than I remember? Did people assume there would be more dates/events? I was never really clear on what loverfest was even going to be, a concert or more of a larger thing.

20819,"Does anyone have any funny experiences related to Tay's music? I have one. You might find it funny but it is still MORTIFYING to me.

So. In 2020, while the pandemic was in full swing, I began online classes on zoom. In Physics class, I paid my full attention to the concepts being taught and nearly always finished questions before the rest of the students, hence I would get some time to sit idle.

During said time, I had a habit of typing Taylor lyrics into the chat. You can see where this is going.

One (not) fine day during my intense Lover phase, I typed in 'We were in the back seat, drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar'

And accidently pressed enter to send it. TO MY PHYSICS TEACHER.

I didn't even realise it for a solid minute. 

When  I did, I first scrambled to see if it is possible to delete messages on zoom. Apparently it is not.

I then left the meeting, deleted my internet history, ran three circles in my room and ate two spoonfuls of Nutella before calming down and resuming class.

I had been hoping he wouldn't see the message. But later that night I saw the recorded version of that lecture. 

At one point, he just STOPPED AND STARED AT THE CHAT SCREEN WITH A DISGUSTED AND CONFUSED EXPRESSION.

He definitely saw it. I've been trying to convince myself since that day that he didn't, but right here I accept that he saw it.

I'm also hoping he's forgotten it by now. He teaches multiple classes full of two hundred students each year, there's no way he still remembers that one incident. Hopefully.

This has kind of ruined Cornelia Street for me. Now I've gotten over it, but sometimes when the song starts playing and the lyric comes on (it's the very first one), I will cringe so hard and skip the song.

My 'called my teacher mom' moment, except I sent my teacher a lyric from a super romantic and dreamy song I had hoped to one day play to my husband. 

MY GOD WHY DID I DO THAT!!

Not Joe, not Matty, but my Physics Teacher ruined Cornelia Street for me. *Sigh.*",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/13u5swk/funny_taylor_stories/,Funny Taylor Stories,TaylorSwift,t3_13u5swk,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/13u5swk/funny_taylor_stories/,2023-05-28 17:17:55,Taylor Swift

16947,"I have the Gibson guitar app, which is an app that is designed to teach you how to play your favorite songs, and it isn't cheap at over a hundred dollars a year. It is technologically awesome, but their song selection is stale and blind to the musical contributions of women and minorities. I wrote to the developers the following, and they replied wanting to know what songs I'd like to see added.

My email to them:

&gt;""I noticed that the tracks offered are almost exclusively by white, male musicians. Run the numbers. I see one song from a woman (Dolly) and one from a Black musician (Bill Withers) and one from a Latino musician (Santana). And not one contemporary minority. It feels like you were checking boxes.  
&gt;  
&gt;I would LOVE to learn some Phoebe Bridgers or Taylor Swift songs. Before you laugh off Swift: Did you know that she has all top ten slots on the Billboard 200, and it is the FIRST time there wasn‚Äôt a male musician in the top ten? She might not be rock and roll, but she‚Äôs got some nice guitar medleys and the world‚Äôs biggest fan base, and our money is still money, right?  
&gt;  
&gt;There aren‚Äôt many women playing guitar because we have so few examples, which is especially evident in this app. If this were the only guitar tab app, I would quit playing guitar. Not exaggerating or being ‚Äúdramatic.‚Äù I have respect for ACDC and Van Halen, but I don‚Äôt listen to or want to learn their music. Even the kids working at Guitar Center roll their eyes if you come in and play that stuff. Fortunately, I have the Ultimate Guitar app that I‚Äôve had for years, but it doesn‚Äôt exactly teach me to be better. It is just tabs and mostly made by fans. Your app has a lot of potential, and I do love it, but I guess I‚Äôm not your target demographic?  
&gt;  
&gt;Any hope of that changing in the future?""

Their reply:

&gt;""Thanks for reaching¬†out! Thank you for drawing our attention to this. We are currently planning as many famous song drops as possible that'll help us to diversify the app even more. Unfortunately, we are limited my Publishing Rights Organisations, as certain songs or artists are only available in certain locations, or we don't have the license for certain pieces of music secured as of yet. However, we are working very hard at securing these licenses in order to increase our apps diversity!  
&gt;  
&gt;Regarding music you'd like to learn, please feel¬†free to send us on a list of songs that you'd like to see added to the app and we'll work on getting them added! We have a few Taylor Swift songs in the pipeline right now, the licensing was changing hands a lot when the artist gained ownership of her own masters, but we're starting to see some clarification of these master rights. Therefore, we can secure licenses directly and get the songs added. But as I say, please feel free to send us on any songs or artists you'd like to see added and we'll work on getting them in! Let me know if you have any other questions, comments or suggestions as well.""

15724,"I‚Äôm just realllly paying attention listening to this now, because I‚Äôm in the mood for slow n sad‚Ä¶ and oh. Oh my. 

There seems to me to be multiple Taylor references. Or what could very easily be Taylor references. And Suki is for sure Taylor‚Äôs type. Pure speculation and fun ofc but umm.. reading some of the lyrics‚Ä¶ 

 
- ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what we came for‚Äù ‚Ä¶ possible reference to ‚ÄúThis is What You Came For‚Äù

- ‚Äúhanding out gold stars for tailor-made behaviour‚Äù ‚Ä¶ I think we‚Äôve all heard of the gold star lesbian, and tailor made/Taylor made üëÄ

-  ‚ÄúI can see your team is shining like prizes‚Äù ‚Ä¶ could refer to PR, and also bejewelled anyone?! I know Midnights was released after this song and the album it belongs to, but we also know Taylor does share her stuff w certain folks before release. 
 
- ‚ÄúGot what you need, when you hang up and say I'll see you later‚Ä¶ got what you need, write it down, California paper. Got what you need, forevermore my anti-hero, for loving and letting me go down, down‚Äù ‚Ä¶ this whole thing screams using me for writing inspiration/as a muse, and I mean ‚Äúanti-hero &amp; forevermore‚Äù in the same section feels like it‚Äôs definitely hinting at something.

Not at all certain of anything, just having some speculative gaylor adjacent lyrical analysis fun.

 I do think Suki is some flavour of queer, especially since listening to ‚ÄúJohanna‚Äù - also, I mean it‚Äôs worth checking out her music, it‚Äôs quite beautiful!

Debut, Fearless (Platinum Edition), Speak Now, Red and 1989 are all available on Black vinyl. All of them are widely available. The coloured versions (RSD) are rare and really expensive and pretty much only can be bought on online marketplaces.

Reputation is pressed on a Picture Disc and sometimes can be harder to obtain but at the moment it should be widely available. There's also a Orange pressing but similarly to the RSD pressings it's also expensive and hard to find.

Lover is pressed on Pink and Blue vinyl. This is the only pressing of the album and it's widely available.

Folklore has 8 variants. The ones that are widely available are the Beige and Gold pressings of In The Trees (standard album cover) and the Target Red pressing (Meet Me Behind The Mall cover).

All pressings of Evermore are widely available. Green Translucent and Target Red in US and Opaque Green in EU.

All pressings of Midnights are also widely available (excluding the ones that come with signed print). Moonstone Blue, Jade Green, Blood Moon, Mahogany and Lavender.

Both Fearless TV and Red TV are also widely available. Gold and Target Red pressings for Fearless while Red has Black and Target Red.

I would also recommend creating a Discogs account if you don't have one.

15984,"Karma diverges from the overall theme of midnights, her most self-depreciating album yet, as Taylor‚Äôs less-personal ear-wormy hit singles sometimes do.

That is, in Karma, Taylor alleges her amazing karma in the universe is what makes her career and interpersonal life so successful. Coming from Taylor Swift, this reads as satire, as the implication of her having good karma contradicts nearly every other track on the album. Dear Reader, Midnight Rain, Anti-Hero, High Infidelity, Bejeweled, Mastermind, and Vigilante Shit all depict her as morally suspect to varying degrees. In fact, in Mastermind, she details that all positive outcomes are instead by her own design or ‚Äúscheming,‚Äù which she then alludes to in Anti-Hero as what might lead to her eventual downfall, and not some mystical force prioritizing her above all else in the world for her altruism and staying in her own lane.

The intro to Karma, if it‚Äôs the last track you‚Äôve heard off midnights, could almost make you think it‚Äôs self-referential before the song shifts into first-person: ‚Äúaddicted to betrayal but you‚Äôre relevant, you‚Äôre terrified to look down, ‚Äòcause if you dare, you‚Äôll see the glare of everyone you burned just to get there.‚Äù This line sounds like it could‚Äôve been taken straight out of Anti-Hero; it‚Äôs eerily reminiscent of its intro, actually: ‚ÄúWhen my depression works the graveyard shift all of the people I‚Äôve ghosted stand there in the room.‚Äù This is where we can insert the .jpeg of Pam from the office saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs the same picture.‚Äù

In its chorus, Taylor describes Karma as a myriad of different things, from ‚Äú\[her\] boyfriend‚Äù to ‚Äúa god‚Äù to ‚Äúthe breeze in \[her\] hair on the weekend‚Äù to ‚Äúa relaxing thought.‚Äù It‚Äôs ‚Äúsweet like honey‚Äù and ‚Äúa cat, purring in \[her\] lap because it loves \[her\], flexing like a goddamn acrobat.‚Äù So essentially, karma is an abstract manifestation of positive things in her life, and it almost seems they have a sort of symbiotic relationship (‚Äúme and karma vibe like that!‚Äù).

Later in the song, she transitions back into the chorus with the lyric: ‚ÄúKarma is the guy on the screen, coming straight home to me, cause karma is my boyfriend.‚Äù

When she released Midnights, the narrative was that she was dating Joe Alwyn, an actor (although certainly not some swooned-over big shot A-lister the way this lyric might imply), presumably the informal ‚Äúguy on the screen‚Äù coming straight home to her. But Taylor herself in Dear Reader suggests otherwise: ‚ÄúIf you knew where I was walking, to a house not a home, all alone, cause nobody‚Äôs there.‚Äù The direct parallel between these two lyrics is interesting.

In Call It What You Want, from her earlier album, Reputation, I guess Karma was taking a nap, as Taylor describes her golden reputation/metaphorical throne being usurped. She opens with: ‚ÄúMy castle crumbled overnight, I brought a knife to a gunfight, they took the crown but it‚Äôs all right.‚Äù Nonetheless, as she transitions into the chorus, she asserts: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing better than I ever was.‚Äù Then, the chorus leads with: ‚ÄúCause my baby‚Äôs fit like a daydream walking with his head down, I‚Äôm the one he‚Äôs walking to.‚Äù Does the structure of this line seem familiar?

In CIWYW, Taylor describes an intimate love that shelters her from the evils and chaos of the outside world. She personifies these forces of evil (critics? KimYe PR? Scooter?) as conniving villains throughout the song attempting to trick, steal from, or otherwise harm her and her metaphorical kingdom. Whether or not her career was legitimately being threatened during this time, Taylor‚Äôs feelings of persecution are very real. And her solace in this muse offers a place of warmth and peace of mind (‚ÄúI‚Äôm laughing with my lover making forts under covers, trust him like a brother, yeah I know I did one thing right‚Äù). This muse is her source of happiness, in this moment of her life, they were her karma.

The utter contrast of the conceit in Karma as the antithesis of Dear Reader, juxtaposed with the sensitivity in CIWYW, leads me to conclude that Karma is drenched in irony to the point of parody, and ""the guy"" she's flexing like a goddamn acrobat is not invaluable (compared to ""the rubies that \[she\] gave up""). It's really not the thematic exception on Midnights after all. Therefore, her lyric change to ‚ÄúKarma is the guy on the Chiefs coming straight home to me!‚Äù is not only performative, but almost a parody of the performance art that is her public image.

It feels not only impersonal, but ridiculously self-contradictory to sing this retroactive edit to millions of fans at her sold-out Eras world tour, after one of her foundational lyrics was ‚Äúin your life, you‚Äôll do things greater than dating the boy on the football team.‚Äù Not to mention the irony of this cheeky lyric change after reading Taylor's Version of the 1989 prologue, condemning the media for speculating about who she is dating at any given moment, and who she writes her songs about (""The greatest of luxuries is your secrets"").

Then, what is the implication of her switching out the subordinate clause of this informal lyric (‚ÄúI used to switch out these kens‚Äù)?

The obvious ""Burton to my Taylor""

The ""another day another drama"" -> quote by Liz Taylor on a crazy day she had with Richard Burton, filled with love and crazy activities

26680,"As we all know CLM is a God tier song and I don't think it'll ever stop being talked about. I've seen a couple posts on tiktok recently talking about their interpretation of the song and I wanted to share mine. 

I believe ""cowboy"" is a metaphor for being famous. To me it was very obvious when I first heard this song, but I've seen a lot of people be very literal in their interpretation so maybe I'm alone in this. When you think about it though, cowboys don't stay in one place for too long, and actors and musicians are known for traveling a lot. To some it may seem glamorous, but I think Taylor is painting this picture of herself as a stoic cowboy out on the froteir, alone, never getting attached to anyone because her lifestyle doesn't really allow for her to do so. Also, think of the loneliness in fame. 

""And the tennis court was covered up
With some tent-like thing
And you asked me to dance
But I said, ""Dancing is a dangerous game""
Oh, I thought
This is gonna be one of those things
Now I know
I'm never gonna love again"" 

I always imagined this as being a wedding. They've converted the tennis court into either a dance floor or dining area. This could be about meeting at an actual wedding or any other formal event celebrities would meet at (The Grammys perhaps?). When Taylor met this person, she didn't think much of it. She meets attractive people all the time in the industry she's in, and she definitely has lots of suitors, so she had a feeling it would play out how it always does. But maybe once they danced or shared a conversation, she knew this person was different. ""I'm never gonna love again,"" meaning this person is it for me. We love our dramatic queen. 

""I've got some tricks up my sleeve
Takes one to know one
You're a cowboy like me"" 

I've always took this to be about how Taylor as a public persona basically has to ""trick"" people into liking her (whether we think that's true or not). She may be a genuinely good person (we know she's done some pretty amazing things for her fans and her crew), but she always has to stay vigilant to make sure her image remains clean. Her lover in this song, who is in the industry as well, would relate to this on some level, aka ""Takes one to know one, you're a cowboy like me."" 

""Telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
Like it could be love
I could be the way forward
Only if they pay for it""

This is likely about investors or other industry professionals they'd have to answer to. Not only do they have to ""con"" their fans, they have to ""con"" the ""rich folks."" They have to schmooze. 

""It could be love
We could be the way forward
And I know I'll pay for it""

I love the way she flips the lyrics from the last verse from ""I could be the way forward, only if they pay for it"" to ""We could be the way forward, and I know I'll pay for it."" In this sense, I just think she's saying how hard it is to be in a relationship when you're on that level of fame. The whole tone of this song is so sad and I think it's meant to reflect how it feels to love someone so much, knowing your fame will possibly ruin your chance at happiness together. It reminds me of the song ""Peace."" 

""And the skeletons in both our closets
Plotted hard to fuck this up"" 

I think this line is just about the pressures of being famous. It could refer to Taylor's false cancelation before Reputation, or just the fact that her old relationships were so well documented to the point she had no privacy. 

""With your boots beneath my bed
Forever is the sweetest con""

I've seen people interpret this as ""forever doesn't exist."" Forever is the con. To me, I think it's just a tongue in cheek way of saying ""You're stuck with me."" Like she conned her lover into loving her forever. 

""I've had some tricks up my sleeve
Takes one to know one
You're a cowboy like me"" 

Taylor has finally met her match. Someone who understands the fame and the loneliness and the dark and twisted ways of Hollywood. 

""I'm never gonna love again"" 

Some people take this to mean they've broken up and she'll never move on from it, but I believe it means this is her person and she'll never love anyone else.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/16f2f65/cowboy_like_me_as_a_metaphor_for_fame/,Cowboy Like Me as a metaphor for fame,TaylorSwift,t3_16f2f65,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/16f2f65/cowboy_like_me_as_a_metaphor_for_fame/,2023-09-10 15:01:36,Taylor Swift

I purchased it several years ago from a girl who attended her 2015 Shanghai concert where they had a merch stand with a few signed CDs for sale. There‚Äôs no information about this on western media platforms which makes it hard for me to price, and while there are some old posts on Chinese social media of fans who managed to purchase a signed copy at her 2015 Shanghai concert, none of those people are putting it up for sale so I really have no benchmark to go off of. 

Would really appreciate some help and insight!

Also I have a Billie Eilish WWAFAWDWG signed CD purchased from Banquet Records in 2019 when they had a few signed copies for sale - still sealed with the .SIG sticker in the back, if anyone knows how much that could be worth too I would be so grateful!

I'm just curious to people who have been to her shows, is it better to go in without knowing the setlist or to do some research to see what songs she has performed at the previous shows? 

I could see benefits to both, because I would love to be totally surprised and flip out when I hear the start to a song I'm in love with, but I would also kind of like to know what's coming so I can get ready to film concert moments that I'm excited about. Also I have social anxiety so I like to look up setlists when I go to other concerts so I can be sure to know all the words and not look like a poser.

Today's song is Tell Me Why! Give me your best song ideas and Tell Me Why (hehe) it is a worthy replacement!

The guidelines are:


1. No covers of Taylor's songs from other artists. All genres/artists are welcome, as long as they are AT LEAST relatively known. No obscures, please.


2. The songs you are suggesting must fit somehow the theme or vibe of the Taylor song. Track titles don't matter.


3. MOST UPVOTED COMMENT WINS.


4. Have fun with it, be as crazy as you want with your picks.

21742,"Red is celebrated as the essential album for the first 8 years or so of Taylor's career, as it straddles the country and pop sensibilities of her career up to that point. Midnights does the same thing for her entire almost two-decade-old career. It's not a coincidence that Taylor decided to make the monumental tenth studio album benchmark a celebration of her sonic endeavors on her past 9 albums, as Midnigths was created during the recording process of her past discography and consequently serves as an amalgamation of the essences of what makes each album special.

Midnights mixes the storytelling building blocks of her earlier career (Midnight Rain and You're on your own kid harken back to themes she explored on debut and Fearless), with pop-rock influences of Speak Now (You're on you own, kid), the camp of Red's pop songs (Karma, Bejeweled), the quirky 80s synth-pop and satirical self-awareness of 1989 (Anti-Hero is the love child of Out of the Woods sonically, and Blank Space lyrically, Mastermind is New Romantics younger sister lyrically, Maroon reminds me of Style), the dark, industrial, r&b tinged instrumentals of Reputation (Maroon, Midnight Rain, Glitch, Dear Reader), the offbeat sonics of Lover (Snow on the Beach and It's Nice to Have a Friend, Sweet Nothing/ You're Losing Me and Cornelia Street, The Archer and Labyrinth), the unrestrained and unconventional lyricism of folklore and evermore ( The Great War, Would've Could've Should've, Hits Different), and the perspective of a 30 something Taylor to deliver a collage of songs that honour and venerate her musical legacy so far. 

I think she will continue to release albums like Red and Midnights that serve as prologues for each era of her life, and I'm looking forward to the first chapter of her next epoch.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/14cj15a/why_midnights_is_the_quintessential_taylor_album/,Why Midnights is the quintessential Taylor album,TaylorSwift,t3_14cj15a,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/14cj15a/why_midnights_is_the_quintessential_taylor_album/,2023-06-18 12:16:52,Taylor Swift

21532,"Why are lots of critics and some causal fans not huge about Midnights? Was it because of the ‚Äúsudden‚Äù change  from Folklore/Evermore?

I think lots of people enjoyed Folklore and Evermore because of the sudden change from her discography of commercial pop. 
(Have you noticed Taylor‚Äôs hits have been used a lot in media when she makes pop bangers? It‚Äôs not a bad thing! Folklore/Evermore didn‚Äôt really receive that though)

Also, Taylor released those at the right time when ‚Äúsad girl indie‚Äù began to rise in popularity (Mitski, Phoebe, etc)

Although, I think Midnights is refreshing subtle synth pop without being too obnoxious like radio pop nowadays or depending too hard on being TOO 80‚Äôs with it‚Äôs production. Taylor‚Äôs songwriting is very fun yet thoughtful on this album. 

Though, I heard people complain that the album is too sonically tied together. Which is strange because always Taylor wasn‚Äôt a person who‚Äôs very avant-garde with sound. I didn‚Äôt find Midnights ‚Äúboring‚Äù whatsoever because of this?

Is it because of Jack Antonoff‚Äôs production? Some people are getting a bit bored of him.
I‚Äôve heard lots of praise the 3AM tracks produced by Aaron Dessner even if they weren‚Äôt huge about the original tracklist.

13290,"I‚Äôve been thinking about the promotion of GUTS recently and I find it interesting how different it is from SOUR. 

SOUR follows the more traditional route of a big album release. Her label did an amazing job leading up to the album. Deja Vu and Good 4 u are great single choices showing off her versatility as an artist. Especially when good 4 u went straight to number 1 a week before the album dropped. We also got SO MANY performances of DL. At the Brits, Talk shows, SNL‚Ä¶etc. After that we have SOUR prom, the Disney documentary. 

which leads me to the promo for GUTS. It seems like Olivia and the label is taking a different approach this time. Only two singles before the album, close to zero live performances. It seems like they really trusted the fan base, or is it because Olivia was too overwhelmed by the instant success of Sour she wanted to chill things out this time? Which is totally understandable, she talks quite often about how the instant fame affected. 

She also comes across as someone who doesn‚Äôt really care for being the next big thing if that makes sense. She just seems like a genuine music lover who wants to write songs that she loves and perform for her fans rather than chasing No.1s.

Also there is a line in the book when her other brother begins justifying actions of their family and she writes ‚Äúwas a film I had already seen, and knew the ending of‚Äù. 

The term exile has also been used in the book. Maybe it‚Äôs a stretch, but as I was reading the last few chapters of the book the words of the song came to mind. I always thought it was about romantic love but now I‚Äôm thinking maybe she wrote the song inspired by the book.

Either way it can be anything as I basically have no limits in terms of size and weight gain and no limits to kinks.

11682,"Does anyone thinks that the TS official merch quality was not as good as the 'old' merch era? I mean like the Rep album is my favorite and I got the snake oversize hoodle, King of my heart jigsaw puzzle, reputation key chain and guitar pick rep coaster set from the US store in 2019. Then the official store page was closed after reputation stadium tour for a while for the Taylor version era. Hoodie is comfortable ,nice keychain and the puzzle was made from good thick cardboard.

I was thinking to order some speak now Taylor version merch from the offical store. But I read discussion over here and noticed that there is a lot of feedback about the paintng on snow globe, quality of the cardigan etc this year.

Anyone notices that too? I mean I am excited to hear   surprising founding while unboxing and I am looking forward to the Rep Taylor version.

1. Mr. Tambourine Man. This would prob be problematic for her but selfishly I'd die to hear her cover it.

3. Past the Mission (whoever mentioned the similarities bw this song and CLM, ily). 

4. Wuthering Heights. I'd love a whole theatrical video for it too. She's made for it. 

5. Fix You. I think even more than a cover, I'd love for her to duet this song w CM. It would heal me in so many different ways. 

6. Unwritten. One of my favorite songs and I wouldn't want it acoustic either.

**After reworking some things, I have come to the conclusion that what I originally thought was kismet/a fluke/funzies was** ***almost definitely on purpose*** **and I really think this needs more attention:**

# EVERY MUSIC VIDEO OFF OF LOVER WAS MADE TO SYNC UP WITH A SONG BY [THE BEATLES](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/paul-mccartney-taylor-swift-musicians-on-musicians-1089058/).

You will need to use two different devices in order to do this.*

***EDIT/UPDATE: THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT RECORDINGS FOR SOME OF THESE SONGS. PLEASE USE THE LINKS PROVIDED IN THIS POST FOR BEST RESULTS.*** 

# [ME!](https://youtu.be/FuXNumBwDOM) and [Come Together](https://youtu.be/45cYwDMibGo):

* Play ""Come together right now ***over*** **ME!**""
* Use the ""Come Together"" animated video (linked above) and start both videos at 0:00. You will know that the timing has synced correctly if the snake explodes during the lyric ""flat top"".

* After the release of *Anthology 2*, a theory circulated that John Lennon could be heard saying ""I killed Paul"" at the end of ‚ÄúStrawberry Fields‚Äù. Turns out, what he actually said was **""cranberry sauce""** two times, followed by ""**Calm down**, Ringo.""

# You might be thinking, cool trick but why are you posting about this in the gaylor sub...(You are of course welcome to share this in the stonedswifties sub as well!)

I have [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/GaylorSwift/comments/104i1ct/allusions_to_other_musicians_work_in_the_lover/) in the past about Taylor's allusions to the Beatles and there. are. so. many.

However, I think the biggest takeaway is that she is trying to communicate that **everything is not what it seems.**

She is ***the Eggman:***

* ""I told you about Strawberry Fields, you know the place where ***nothing is real***? Well, here's another place you can go, where ***everything flows***. Looking through the bent back tulips to ***see how the other half lives***. ***Looking through a glass onion.***""
* Lennon and McCartney wrote ""Glass Onion"" as a response to fans overanalyzing and reading into small details while ignoring what was **glaringly obvious**. This seems to go against what Taylor encourages from her fans...***However,*** what was in ***screaming color (!!!)*** during the *Lover* era but was largely dismissed (outside of this community) because of the *details* that seemed to prove otherwise...

4968,"My prompt: I'm going to send lyrics now. The scenario is that the writer is Sapphic while the muse is her best friend who is also Sapphic. Apply the scenario to the lyrics I am about to send

(I send the lyrics of dress)

The answer: Based on the lyrics you provided, it seems that the song captures the emotions and desires of a person (the writer) who has romantic feelings for their best friend (the muse), and both individuals identify as Sapphic. The lyrics reflect a sense of secrecy, longing, and anticipation, as the writer navigates their hidden attraction.

The line ""All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation"" suggests that the writer has been keeping their feelings hidden and patiently waiting for something to happen between them and their best friend. The mention of ""silence"" indicates that they haven't expressed their true emotions to the friend or to others around them.

The line ""Say my name and everything just stops"" implies that the writer longs for their best friend to acknowledge their romantic feelings. They desire a connection that goes beyond friendship, as indicated by the line ""I don't want you like a best friend.""

The writer's desire for a deeper connection is further emphasized by the line ""Only bought this dress so you could take it off."" It suggests that the writer is willing to go to great lengths to explore a more intimate relationship with their best friend.

The mention of ""carving your name into my bedpost"" could symbolize a desire to leave a lasting impression or mark on their shared experiences and intimate moments. It signifies a desire for a deeper connection and a longing to be seen and recognized by their best friend.

Overall, the lyrics capture the complex emotions and desires that arise in a scenario where the writer is romantically attracted to their best friend, both of whom identify as Sapphic. The lyrics express the yearning for a deeper connection and the struggle of keeping their feelings hidden.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Gaylor_Swift/comments/16zhswo/chats_interpretation_of_the_song_dress_do_you/,Chat‚Äôs interpretation of the song ‚ÄúDress‚Äù.

2300,"Let's talk Hype Boy MVs! I recently rewatched all the girls' music videos and I found myself creating storylines, ranking chemistry, etc. so I thought, why not hear what users on this sub think? I'll go first.

1 - Minji's MV - Personally I felt like Minji and her Hype Boy had the most chemistry/interaction which made it my favourite, especially because you don't really see that sort of thing in girl group MVs often. Also, I thought her Hype Boy had the most personality with stealing her cup, teasing her, the play fighting, writing down his number and his changing hair and aesthetic. Maybe it's because I'm a writer but I could really picture him as an actual person outside of Minji and their interaction if that makes sense? Like he definitely goes to a creative arts school, really changeable with his thoughts and feelings, super friendly with everyone and ""takes life one day at a time"". Also loved the message of not changing yourself to please others, because people can be fickle.¬† Anyways, onto the next!

2 - Haerin/Dani's MV - the DRAMA!! Lol jk, but I loved the theme of this. Aside from Minji's, this felt the most like I was watching a coming of age TV show. The liking the same guy, choosing their friendship first, and breaking and entering to get revenge on himüíÄ and it reminded me of Little Mix's ""Love Me Like You"" MV where the guy gave all the girls the same flower. Like really dude, you couldn't even change the lollipop colour? Also I just loved the awkwardness at the pool scene where all the girls are looking at their Hype boys and these two are nudging each other like ""welp, we're the odd ones out igü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"". That and the scene where they're comparing text messages were interesting and I was shocked right alongside them.¬†

3 - Hanni's MV - First of all, A+ for representation. I was shocked to find out the Hype ""boy"" was a girl bc‚Ä¶well kpop. Aside from that, this MV was sooo cute and relatable. I've definitely started having crushes on famous dancers/people from videos I've watched online (see ""Les Twins"" who could be my fathersüíÄ) and watching Hanni fangirl the same way I do was adorable, especially with her and Minji laughing and discussing her Hype Boy. I think the only drawback is I kinda wanted them to do more with the ending, but what can we do, amirite?

4 - Hyein's MV - Firstly, Hyein you deserve wayyy better. I love how the MV showed that we can sometimes hype up people who actually aren't what we imagine them to be in our heads and then end up disappointmented at our own made up perception of them basically. Imo, this one was the most ""real"" of the bunch. The thing is, throughout the MV, I kept thinking of why Hyein liked her Hype Boy. Hanni fell for the dancing, Minji fell for the playfulness and creativity, Danielle and Haerin likely fell for the fact that the dude is tall as heck + a basketball player, c'mon folksüôà, but for Hyein the guy was just‚Ä¶rude? Which honestly, is also realistic but yeah, wasn't a fan. I did like the end when they saw him mocking them and got super upset tho, that was hilarious.¬†

So yeah, that's my ranking. Like I said, I'm a writer + I watch A LOT of coming of age TV shows so I went in-depth but you guys don't have to. Sooo what's your ranking of the Hype Boy MVs?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NewJeans/comments/117n65f/230220_lets_rank_hype_boy_mvs/,230220 Let's rank Hype Boy MVs!,NewJeans,t3_117n65f,/r/NewJeans/comments/117n65f/230220_lets_rank_hype_boy_mvs/,2023-02-20 22:51:04,New Jeans

16595,"I've played this game my entire life and I personally call it ""cover-overs"" (like with internal rhyming: cover-uhver), but cover trades might make more sense to others.

Basically, pick Taylor and another artist. What song of theirs would you want Taylor to cover, and what Taylor song would you want the other artist to cover.

I think it's a great way to see what other artists Taylor fans have in common and a great way to discover new music because we all know we have one favorite artist in common. Plus it's just fun to imagine Taylor singing ANYTHING in my opinion.

I'm going to put little reasons with my choices because I want to, but don't feel pressured to! Sometimes it just makes sense to you and maybe other commenters can share why they like your choices. I'd like to be brief but I can't because of who I am as a person so here's 10 to get started!

&amp;#x200B;

**Bon Iver**

this is me trying - all those low notes, with the high ""at least I'm trying"" ugh and he's so good when he sings quickly.

[Blindsided](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vschq2SYrFE)\-  soft Taylor: ""Would you really rush out? (For me now)"". 

**Carly Rae Jepsen**

Conrelia Street - Her cute little voice would match this song perfectly.

[Bends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78hnLziDayQ) \- so mellow and beautiful, I thought of Clean the first time I heard it.

**Fiona Apple**

Maroon - imagine her growling ""and  I awake with your memory, that's a real fucking legacy, to leave""

[Anything We Want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfXvIs9bojM) \- sexual. 

**Joanna Newsom**

Sweet Nothing - sweetness overload more like?

[Sapokanikan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky9Ro9pP2gc)\- I stan SAT vocab queens. ""And the records they left are cryptic at best /Lost in obsolescence / The text will not yield, nor x-ray reveal / With any fluorescence / Where the hand of the master begins and ends"" are you kidding me?

**John Prine (RIP legend, I miss you so much)**

Dorothea - John Prine has the perfect gravelly voice to hold that ""Dorotheeeeeeaa-a-a""

Mean - he's also very humerous and I think this would go well.

[Angel from Montgomery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6cagWYTGCY) \- the mix of restraint and power is perfect for her.

**Mitski**

Would've, Could've, Should've - Mitski is the only other artist I would trust with the ""girlhood"" line. 

[Last Words of Shooting Star](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26vvJPWuG5A) \- I enjoy crying and I'm including a lyric video for a reason.

**The National**

Champagne Problems - Just imagine Matt Berringer singing that bridge in his baritone glory.

[Slow Show](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=slow+show+the+national) \-  so romantic, favorite first line of any National song, and I don't know why but I'd give my right eye to hear Taylor sing the line ""can I get a minute of not being nervous, and not thinking of my dick"" in her low register.

**Okkervil River**

I Almost Do - these boys do a great job with slow country/folk sounds

[Another Radio Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKRafAGjGBY) \- Bridge queen, meet my bridge king (seriously, it goes so hard, starts at 2:15 you won't regret it).

**Perfume Genius**

Dress - this song would allow him to go full sassy and that's the goal at every Perfume Genius show.

[Describe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAoWMJTClqo)\- the industrialness of Maroon makes me think she would crush this.

**St. Vincent**

Cruel Summer - Annie helped write and please yes god.

[Champagne Year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7In52DHMcw) for the lyrics, [Landmines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPFRsAQWrUM) because Taylor's tour hands and sideways glances fit so well.

2168,"I really have not been such a big fan of a K-pop girl group before until NewJeans came in. Everything about them is immediately so different.

1. Image/Concept ‚Äî in a time when everyone‚Äôs trying to do a girl crush concept, NJ‚Äôs y2k style is really a breath of fresh air. While idk how this concept will pan out as they mature, right now it encapsulates their youth perfectly. And most importantly they don‚Äôt have to be in clothes too mature or inappropriate for their age. 

Honestly, while girl crush seems so admirable because of a ‚Äústrong woman‚Äù image, it‚Äôs not really relatable. If I were to take BP as an example of a girl group (since it‚Äôs the one I‚Äôm most into before NJ and out of all other GG in the scene), while I like and will bop to their top hits, their lyrics never sit right with me because it always sounds like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a better woman than you‚Äù and that doesn‚Äôt sound very women-power to me :-/ I feel like the girl crush concept has also led to very toxic fandoms with the fans pitting the members against one another. üôÑ

And for other GG, if they aren‚Äôt doing the girl crush concept then it‚Äôs always too cutesy for me. 

So NewJeans‚Äô concept really drew me in because it‚Äôs so unique and and pure. It‚Äôs cool yet not intimidating. 

2. Music ‚Äî I know they only have 6 songs but all of them are such earworms! It took me awhile to get into OMG but now it‚Äôs completely stuck in my head. My brain will randomly go ‚Äúoh my oh my god‚Ä¶‚Äù out of nowhere and it‚Äôs not even annoying. 

I‚Äôm no professional in music so I can‚Äôt perfectly describe why their songs work for me‚Ä¶ I guess I‚Äôm just sick of the same old beats and drops in kpop. The only other GG songs that have made me feel like ‚Äúoh this is something different‚Äù is ASAP by STAYC and Dolphin by OMG. 

3. Visuals ‚Äî Again, the only GG that had me WOW-ed at first sight. Might be mean of me to say this but for other GGs, maybe only 1 or 2 will stand out and the rest looks pretty common or similar in a‚Ä¶ manufactured way? However, all the NJs members really stood out to me. I did have trouble differentiating them at the start (except for Danielle) in their debut photos because they looked similar with the big rounded eyes and full lips but it‚Äôs not like they have common faces‚Ä¶ each of them just has really unique features and aura that I‚Äôve not felt from a GG before! 

Lastly, might be too early to say this too but the girls just seem really genuine and sweet ‚Äî none of the sassy savage princessy vibes. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôve trained for really long together (maybe 2-3 years according to wiki?) but it seems like they bonded really well. 

Really can‚Äôt wait for more song releases this year. They‚Äôre gonna go so far! And also hoping the fandom won‚Äôt turn toxic. ü§ûüèª

27936,"Hi! I‚Äôm a new-ish Swiftie. I saw ‚Äúnew-ish‚Äù because I was a really big Taylor Swift fan back when her debut and Fearless albums were released. I stopped listening after Speak Now because it was ‚Äúuncool‚Äù to like Taylor at the time. I was already bullied a lot and really struggled with my mental health, family life, and just being accepted as a whole so I really would have done anything for anyone to like me. As I entered into adulthood, I still struggled with the same ideology of fitting in/being accepted with and by peers and family members. I very much would shrink myself to fit in places that couldn‚Äôt and wouldn‚Äôt provide enough space for me. I really didn‚Äôt understand who I was, what I liked, what I disliked, and what made my personality unique to me. 

When I got married and really started to understand my existence as an individual, as a friend, and as a partner, I found myself going back to the things I loved the most about life and most about being me. I found myself watching old shows, movies, and listening to old music that I used to love. I found myself back in the world of Taylor Swift. I‚Äôm really sad I missed out on so much but honestly, following Taylor again encouraged me to stop shrinking myself for the acceptance of others. I love the way she has faced adversity and the desire to be accepted to just accepting herself and letting the world see her for who she is. 

I‚Äôm not saying that Taylor is the reason behind my profound struggle just to be clear. I‚Äôm saying that Taylor has inspired me to embrace my individuality and girlhood as a whole. I have had so much fun watching other Taylor Swift fans go to the Eras Tour and events. I‚Äôve had so much fun watching Taylor just be herself without any fear (at least to the public eye). Watching her has helped me let go and just enjoy being myself. I‚Äôm not sure the point of this post but I felt like this was the perfect place to share my excitement! Anyway, thank you to the Swifties who have made me feel welcome for one of the first times in my life. 

P.S. My husband and I are going to see the Eras Tour movie tomorrow and I‚Äôm so excited and so is he! He even made friendship bracelets which I thought was so cute.

23125,"These two records are the closest to her newer albums than the last 3 re-records.

If you‚Äôre like me, I‚Äôve struggled to latch on to the re-records because they just don‚Äôt hit in the same way the originals did, and that‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs not morally bad thing to prefer the originals and just because there‚Äôs a bunch of drama tied to them doesn‚Äôt mean we should fear, hate or forbid them. Most of us grew up with these records. Fearless released as I started high school, that little country girl meant something to me.

I own all of her original albums, purchased then usually at the time of release and don‚Äôt rely on streaming her old music which is where the revenue would come from. Morally I feel okay listening to the older ones knowing no money is going towards the person/people who bought them. But I digress‚Ä¶

When they were made her voice wasn‚Äôt as mature as it is now. However 1989, and even more noticeable, Reputation are both recorded with her maturer voice.

I only have one folklore variant and it‚Äôs the clandestine meetings one which is a gorgeous color and I‚Äôm happy just owning and playing that one.

The narrative is of her being happy in love, of the two them making a perfect couple, of their relationship being broadcasted to the public, a play-by-play.

I'm going to discuss how midnights details her true relationships being hidden and kept from the public, and how she exists in this duality: the image she presents to the public of this perfect, successful, straight woman, and the person she really is, the one she has to hide.

The current relationship started like this:

It begins with a guy begging (publicly) for her attention, she gives in, they meet and on their first meeting, get photographed walking out of the game together, and riding around in a car with the top down (to facilitate photos being taken of them). She attends his games; they get photographed close to one another at an event; he attends her show, changes the lyrics to identify him, plays End Game that night, then runs into his arms after the show and kisses him and we've seen that he was led out of the tent by Taylors dad in order to be visible to the crowd, and there was also a camera person there to capture this kiss.  

That's the story she is presenting to us right now.

Midnights presents a different story:

Lavender Haze - ""I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say, No deal, the 1950s shit they want from me""

* Expressing that she doesn't care what people say and she certainly will not be doing what they say and follow it up with what those people are saying - the 1950's shit they want from her, which is the typical 1950s housewife, marrying a man, being the perfect couple, and having kids. So these people are saying to her that she should be this 1950s wife and she's saying ""no deal"" to that, and that she's not going to be this 1950s wife.

Maroon - ""The mark they saw on my collarbone, the rust that grew between telephones, the lips I used to call home""

* This song details a romance that is taking place in private - Being in a room, on the floor listening to vinyl with her lover. The pre-chorus mentions dancing barefoot - again if she's barefoot, she would be in private, comfortable with the lover.
* The romance falls apart at the lyric, ""the mark **they** saw on my collarbone"" (oddly, a lot of sites incorrectly state ""you"" instead of ""they""). That's when the distance grows, and the lover is in the hallway crying (again private), and the reason this romance falls apart is because ""they"" saw the mark on her collarbone, followed by ""the rust that grew between telephones"". They stopped communicating after the public saw this mark on her collarbone, and this romance was meant to be only private, and now that there are signs to the public of a romance with someone, the relationship starts to break down.

Anti-hero

* The video really shows the meaning of this song. It's always Taylor Swift the brand who says, ""It's me, hi, I'm the problem its me"".  The public image of TS is the one who is the problem, making her do all these things she doesn't want to do. The public TS is the one who comes into her privacy and tells her all these things she *should* be doing for her image, but this makes the private Taylor try to run away and hide, and we can see depression in how the private TS is then portrayed.
* The scene where she goes into a dinner party, too big (famous) to actually be able to join in with these people and have a good time. Don't forget that this dinner. party also has what could easily be interpreted as a wlw couple at the table. She is then shot in the heart and lavender glitter (queer imagery) starts to ooze out from inside of her, and she sadly, dejectedly, covers the lavender inside of her with, ""vote for me for everything"", a message of appealing to everyone and having everyone choose her.
* She'll stare directly at the sun, hurt herself, hurting who she really is, without looking in the mirror, without taking a good look at herself and who she really is and what this 'staring at the sun' is doing to her - the things that the public TS does that hurts her personally.

You're on your own kid

* ""I pick the petals, he loves me not, Something different bloomed, writing in my room, I'll play my songs in the parking lot, I'll run away"" - she feels something *different* inside of her, and writes about this in her room, privately, playing songs in the parking lot because this difference means she can't play these songs publicly, in front of crowds of people. She'll run away because she realizes this difference is not something that is conducive to this famous artist that she is trying to be in this song.
* ""I called a taxi to take me there, I search the party of better bodies, just to learn that my dreams aren't rare"" - She has to call a taxi because this difference means she is no longer accepted, no one would take her to the party. She gets to the party and realizes that there are so many people who want to be famous singers, that she has to change or hide this difference in order to make it. The next verse details what she does in order to make it.
* ""I gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this,I hosted parties and starved my body, Like I'd be saved by a perfect kiss, The jokes weren't funny, I took the money, My friends from home don't know what to say"" - All this work she's done, and the harmful things to make it. They're making jokes about this difference in her, but she ignores the jokes, says nothing and takes the money (record contract?). Taking this money, she's finally starting to make it, but at the expense of having them make fun of who she is/this difference. Her friends from home (those who know her best) don't know what to say because she has decided to take this money, and hide who she is because who she is is seen as a joke and something that can't be taken seriously. It doesn't coincide with taking this money (contract).
* ""I looked around in a blood-soaked gown, And I saw something they can't take away, 'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned, Everything you lose is a step you take"" - Blood-soaked gown, looking around, reminds me of Carrie. They we are laughing and making fun of her (in Taylor's case, because of that difference). She saw something they can't take away - her music, her lyrics, her art showing who she really is. The pages turned with bridges burned - ""something different bloomed, writing in my room"", they've burned these songs, the bridges of the song, because it shows this difference.    She's losing who she is, she's hiding it, and they're destroying it, but it's a step she's taken, because she now has the money, the contract.

Mastermind

* ""And all the stars aligned, You and I ended up in the same room, At the same time"" - it starts out sounding like it was fate that they met, but the song then details how she set it up so they would meet, how she planned it out and schemed it, she lays the groundwork and it goes like clockwork, just as planned, and  it's like a game of chess to her.
* ""If you fail to plan, you plan to fail, Strategy sets the scene for the tale, I'm the wind in our free-flowing sails, And the liquor in our cocktails"" - She's planned the whole relationship out. She has strategized and set the scene for this ""tale""/this romance  (telling tall tales?).  She's the wind in the free-flowing sails - the sails aren't free-flowing if she's the wind. They only appear to be free-flowing - the relationship appears to be happening genuinely and naturally, but she's the wind, she's the one controlling all of it.

Paris

* ""Privacy sign on the door, And on my page and on the whole world, Romance is not dead if you keep it just yours"" - Enough said.

High Infidelity

* ""High infidelity, Put on your records and regret me, I bent the truth too far tonight, I was dancing around, dancing around it"" - Infidelity - disloyalty, unfaithfulness to a moral obligation. The infidelity is her being disloyal to her fans, those who think they know her. She bent the truth too far and danced around it. The truth that she's bending and dancing around is the truth of who she really is. She's being disloyal to her fans by doing this, and if they knew, they would regret her.
* ""Storm coming, Good husband, bad omen, Dragged my feet right down the aisle, At the house lonely, good money, I'd pay if you'd just know me, Seemed like the right thing at the time"" - Everything in this verse is negative except ""good husband"" and ""good money"".  Marriage is signing a contract. She signed a contract with this man, and he's ""good"", he's not the problem.  She dragged her feet down the aisle, meaning she did not want to do this. She did not want to get into this relationship, this contract, was very reluctant, did it anyway and is lonely.  She's got good money for keeping up this image. She would also pay good money for people just to know who she really is. She has the public image of having a boyfriend, but she goes home alone. --Just want to reiterate that she's talking about having a ""good husband"", but everything else in this song does not vibe with that.
* ""your picket fence is sharp as knives"" - This ideal that the public puts on her, this picket fence, 1950s wife they want her to be is killing her but she also feels forced into it.

Dear Reader

* Hoo boy. The last song on the album. The one that closes it out. The last song we're left with as the record ends. This is the imagery/thoughts she wants to leave as with after having this whole album talk about how she's hiding who she is, being forced to do things for image, doing things she does not want to do, and being depressed and alone.
* ""burn all the files, desert all your past lives, and if you don't recognize yourself, that means you did it right""  This is intense. Erasing who she is, deleting it all from history, and she doesn't recognize who she is, but that means she did it ""right"", ""right"" in the eyes of the public, ""right"" in the eyes of her PR team/her public image. Others are forcing her to desert her past lives, hide who she really is, and that's what they want from her, and ""it's okay Taylor, you did the right thing.""  You're on your own, kid.
* ""You don't have to answer, just cause they asked you, dear reader, the greatest of luxuries is your secrets"" - These things she has to hide (relationships with women), that's what is her luxury, and what no one can know about. They ask her, but she doesn't have to answer, and she keeps it a secret.
* ""So I wander through these nights, I prefer hiding in plain sight, My fourth drink in my hand, These desperate prayers of a cursed man, Spilling out to you for free, But darling, darling, please, You wouldn't take my word for it, If you knew who was talking, If you knew where I was walking,To a house, not a home, all alone 'cause nobody's there, Where I pace in my pen and my friends found friends who care, No one sees when you lose when you're playing solitaire""  - Wandering aimlessly through these nights, lost, hiding who she is while depicting a different image to others.  Desperation, wanting to be free from these shackles. She's played this game for so long that the ""reader"", the public wouldn't believe it if she showed who she really was. She's going home to a lonely house. Her friends have all found loves, but she hasn't, because she's been having to hide who she really is and can't be open and out and truly with anyone because of this double life, this image she has to give to other people. 

&#x200B;

This entire album details a woman who has been forced into a certain role, a certain image, a woman who has destroyed her true past and who she really is in order to fit into this mold, this public image, this successful, top-of-the-world, superstar. But this isn't who she really is. She's been forced into it by the public, by people who want her to be as successful as possible, by herself who wants to be as successful as possible. 

Doing that means hiding who she really is, creating fake relationships, creating the image of a couple who met by fate when really, she planned it all out. Anything real and genuine in her life has to be hidden, secretive, completely deleted from history.  

The real relationships are secrets, hidden away from the public; that's where the real romance is. These relationships don't have to be a show for the public; they are about loving one another, not giving a play-by-play to the public of every step of the relationship. But she is giving a play-by-play to the public of a relationship, when her lyrics say that that is not what she wants, that something as public as this is not real. It's masterminded.

And all of this is destroying her, but she doesn't know a way out. There is so much intense pressure on her to be this perfect woman, with a man and happy, that she doesn't know how she can get out. So she's resigned herself to continue living this way, even though it makes her hate who she is.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GaylorSwift/comments/17unpa8/comparing_her_art_midnights_focused_to_her_public/,Comparing Her Art (midnights focused) to Her Public Image,GaylorSwift,t3_17unpa8,/r/GaylorSwift/comments/17unpa8/comparing_her_art_midnights_focused_to_her_public/,2023-11-13 23:03:27,Taylor Swift

25796,"I have noticed some discussion for the rebranding of Taylor‚Äôs Version, and the 1989 announcement seems to be igniting some of this debate.

Fearless, to me, has been changed the least. We were still in the height of the pandemic when this one was released , so I think her options were limited. 

Speak Now also was limited. Her team just seemed to lean more into the storybook aesthetic, which I loved. 

1989 and Red seem to be the more debated rereleases. Personally, the OG Red had a very coastal/ old money aesthetic. I think her team was smart to rebrand it as a ‚Äòsad girl fall‚Äô album. I do miss the original cover. So far, 1989 seems to be going for the coastal look, but 1989 will always be a city album for me. It is my favorite of the new cover though.

20244,"This is something that has been on my mind for a longggggg time and I‚Äôm finally posting it. Please stay with me because it‚Äôs kind of all over the place‚Ä¶

So in ‚ÄúDelicate‚Äù starting at 2:46 right after Taylor says ‚Äúasleep‚Äù there‚Äôs a backing vocal that sounds like an ‚Äúah-a-ahhhh‚Äù kind of melody‚Ä¶ it only goes until about 2:50. For a long time this has reminded me of the vocal melody Ariel sings in The Little Mermaid as she is giving up her voice to Ursula (you can watch the scene on YouTube and hear that part).

Reputation was her last album under her old record label, Big Machine Records (BMR) and I believe contract negotiations were taking place during and after the creation of Rep. Taylor has talked numerous times about the negotiations and how she wanted to own her masters and BMR wouldn‚Äôt offer that.

The scene in The Little Mermaid is reminiscent of this scenario. Ursula (BMR) wants to own Ariel‚Äôs voice and tricks her into signing a contract ‚Äúfor all eternity‚Äù. (I have worked in music and have seen contracts between artists and records labels and the wording is very similar‚Ä¶ ‚Äúin perpetuity‚Äù is what is found in many legally binding contracts). Anyway, Taylor has alluded to this connection between The Little Mermaid & what she experienced with BMR:

-For the Reputation photoshoot, you can see a mermaid on the left shoulder of her camp jacket photoshoot.

-She dressed up as Ariel for Blake‚Äôs New Years Eve party (IG 12/31/2018).

Ultimately she decided not to sign the contact and re-record her albums (brilliant decision).

Anyway‚Ä¶ back to ‚ÄúDelicate‚Äù. I feel like maybe Taylor threw this melody in as an easter egg or a subtle reference to how she was feeling about the negotiations. She has stated in interviews that there are easter eggs she put out during the Reputation and Lover eras that people still haven‚Äôt found, so‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs a chance lol. Or I‚Äôm just crazy. But I do think they sound similar!

20217,"Taylor Swift Reddit has never failed to yield surprisingly helpful answers (love this community!), and so I thought I‚Äôd ask a question here that people may have insight on since I‚Äôm currently researching it. 

I‚Äôm curious as to how clothing brands, especially ones that aren‚Äôt enormous operations but are trying to expand their reach, get noticed by / worn by Taylor. I would assume contacting her stylist would be the way to go to get new clothes into her hands possibly (?), but I wonder if anyone has insight on this, especially for a clothing brand with, say, between 50k and 100k Instagram followers (just for reference in terms of social media reach on one platform). If not her stylist, then who else might be a good contact person or entity? 

I know she‚Äôs worn Magnolia Pearl multiple times before, and I wonder how she got into that line of clothes since they‚Äôre less than 50k followers on Instagram and also aren‚Äôt a huge operation to my knowledge (just using the followers number as a kind of reference point in terms of brand reach on one social media platform).

15778,"When Taylor gave her commencement speech at NYU, I felt her use of the word ""patchwork quilt""  stood out.  

‚ÄúWe are each a patchwork quilt of those who have loved us, those who have believed in our futures, those who showed us empathy and kindness or told us the truth even when it wasn‚Äôt easy to hear. Those who told us we could do it when there was absolutely no proof of that.‚Äù

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBG50aoUwlI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBG50aoUwlI) (quote starts around 6:08)

Much of her NYU speech was coded with Easter Eggs for Midnights (hindsight being 20/20), so I just figured it must have gone over my head.

I've been playing with ChatGPT to try to connect the dots on some of the clues and patterns she has used since the Midnights rollout.  Usually asking questions like ""Does \*fill in the blank\* have any history with queer people?"" 

Here's what ChatGPT has to say about Patchwork Quilt and its history with the LGBTQ+ Community:

**""Patchwork quilts have a rich history within the LGBTQ+ community. In many cases, creating and exchanging patchwork quilts was a way for LGBTQ+ people to express their identity and form social connections within a society that was often hostile to them.**

**During the early days of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s, for example, patchwork quilts became a powerful symbol of the LGBTQ+ community's response to the crisis. Groups of LGBTQ+ activists and artists created massive ""AIDS quilts"" made up of individual panels dedicated to those who had died from the disease. These quilts served as a way to honor the dead, raise awareness about the epidemic, and provide comfort to those who were affected by it.**

**Even before the AIDS crisis, patchwork quilts were an important part of LGBTQ+ culture. In some cases, they were used to create safe spaces for LGBTQ+ people to gather and socialize. For example, in the mid-20th century, some LGBTQ+ bars and clubs would hold ""quilting bees"" where patrons could gather and work on patchwork projects together.**

**Overall, while patchwork quilts have a long and complex history, they have certainly played a significant role in the LGBTQ+ community's history and culture.""**

!!!!!!!!!!

And then it hit me like a ton of bricks.  It was right in front of us!  I know sometimes it can feel like Easter egg theories are way too complicated to be true, but something like this makes me feel like there's way more to uncover.  She gave so many signs :)

6914,"Hello! My name is Cokebottlewithnolid and I am hosting a game called Swiftie Bingo!

How to Play:

The bingo card template that I have created can be found in the link, please make a copy. 

You must choose 10 songs from each of Taylor‚Äôs 10 Albums (Taylor Swift, Fearless, Speak Now, Red, 1989, Reputation, Lover, folklore, evermore, Midnights.) All songs from deluxe versions will be called, however extra things (Piano/Pop versions, voice memos, messages, etc.) will not be called, then add them to their respective cells

Then choose 4 FTV tracks from each of the four TV albums, please do not use TV songs. And finally, the 5 Wild spaces are where you can choose any song from any of the 10 albums or FTV tracks. Please do not choose songs that are from Beautiful Eyes, any of the Christmas tunes or any singles unless they are from their specific album.

Each day I will be randomly spinning a wheel and posting the result of the wheel, if you have that specific song, use the line tool or something that will show you that the song has been called.

A Songs Called List will be posted with each bingo call for anyone to make sure that any missing songs have been crossed off, or for anyone who wants to join the game, called songs will be highlighted in green.

We will be following classic American Bingo rules, so the winners of each of the different patterns will win the following:

Line-A shoutout
X-A shoutout
Blackout-A certificate 

Rules:

Ronan is not going to be called or should be used in this game due to the r/taylorsgameswannaplay rules.

If you get a bingo, immediately call bingo in the comments of the most recent song post, do NOT wait until you have multiple lines to call bingo, the first person that calls it will get the win.

If a song that you have missed gets you a bingo, DO NOT call bingo, if you have missed crossing off songs and you get a bingo from the most recent song, then you may call bingo

Please don‚Äôt fake fake fake fake fake, it ruins the game for everyone.

Notes (Everyone please read)

Any changes to this game will be posted here, so everyone please read, the rules will be posted every day for any new people wanting to play but you don‚Äôt have to read them when you are playing.

Taylor‚Äôs Version songs can be used in the 10 album cells of your card, but the songs I call will not tell you that it is TV unless it is a FTV track.

Please comment under this post if you are playing this game, or if you want to ask questions, I would like to see how many players are playing this game.

It is easier if you put your bingo card on your computer.

The first bingo call will be posted at 8:00pm MST, I hope that you guys join!

14668,"When I first listened to GUTS at 2 A.M the day it came out, the stand-outs for me were making the bed, ballad of a homeschooled girl, and teenage dream as they related to me the most. While other tracks hadn't stood out to me as much, I still understood why they had their place on the album...except for the grudge.

I agreed with many critics and content creators who had thought the concept was weak and the hook was not strong enough as a chorus. But then, I had a really bad day. 

Long story short, an instance of herd mentality had made me feel isolated from everyone else and it made me incredibly upset. I was holding in tears at school until I got back home.

The first song I had thought of was the grudge so I immediately went and put it on and just bawled while taking in the lyrics. It had perfectly incapsulated how I felt in that moment: Angry, alone, deprived, misunderstood, ostracized etc...

Now it's my favorite song of Olivia's...maybe of all time.

1: My assumption is that she was intoxicated but I can‚Äôt say that for sure 

2: My best guess is that she thought I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúhaving fun‚Äù, because I wasn‚Äôt being crazy or moving around a lot. To be honest I wasn‚Äôt feeling great and I was cold so I can see how she interpreted my body language that way, but still no excuse. 

3: to those who are thinking ‚Äúthis is what happens at shows with 30k people‚Äù, last time I checked people don‚Äôt grab your wrist to forcibly pull your hand out of your pocket from 4 feet away at ANY TYPE OF SHOW.

Hi Friends. 

Mods, if you delete this I understand but I feel it‚Äôs something that needs to be shared. 

I was at the Foxborough show tonight in the stadium style seating and during enchanted, a woman behind me reached down (about 4 feet) and grabbed my shoulder hard and started rocking me to the beat of the song. I shrugged her hand off of my shoulder and gave her a dirty look that should have communicated that I was not pleased she had done that. 

During the next song, she reached down AGAIN and this time forcibly pulled my hand out of my pocket by my wrist. I shook her grip off my wrist and very clearly said ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt touch me‚Äù. Not sure that she heard me, I waited until the next interlude and I got her attention and told her not to touch me again and that she needs to keep her hands to herself, not everyone wants to be touched by a stranger. She then says ‚ÄúI was just trying to tell you sorry if I spilled my beer on you‚Äù. 

Right. Sure. 

About 10 mins later she grabbed my shoulder again to apologize ‚Äúif she really made me that uncomfortable‚Äù. 

Anyways. All this to say, of course there will always be some invasion of personal space at concerts but this wasn‚Äôt accidentally bumping someone. This was intentional and weird AF. 

tldr; keep your hands to yourself at concerts and don‚Äôt be weird.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/13mi0sw/psa_personal_space_and_consent_at_concerts/,PSA: Personal Space and Consent at Concerts,TaylorSwift,t3_13mi0sw,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/13mi0sw/psa_personal_space_and_consent_at_concerts/,2023-05-20 04:37:39,Taylor Swift
13477,"# I made an exhaustive Olivia / Guts + Sour influence playlist that I've been working on for you guys the last few days! See below for link.

It's Olivia's catalog including songs from both Guts and Sour plus over 8 hours of tracks that I feel (and many others have noted!) might be referential, could have provided inspo to Olivia and Dan or to me, just share a vibe  with her music.

# HERE'S THE¬†[PLAYLIST](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0T0fDglHA1SjZxVuUiDIxd?si=961613f7fd1643a8)

I organized it so directly after each song of hers you can find the possibly referential tracks. There's lots here that I think we all have been picking up on since SOUR and some stuff that Dan Nigro or Olivia have literally said influenced them but there's also things that more fit the albums' vibes, per se, than straight up share interpolation or riffs. 

Just in case there's anything on here that you disagree with as an influence or callback, please feel free to duplicate the playlist and make your own version! I'm sure we're all hearing different things! It's been so fun to watch people talk about hearing the 90s influences, 2000s pop girlies, grunge, riot grrrl, etc. Just really amazed at Olivia and Dan being so referential but still truly making the records her own!

P.S. sorry I didn't make an Apple Music version but I included screenshots of the playlist [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/0D8ZTpJ) in case you wanted to make one over there!

So I‚Äôm a new-ish swiftie I‚Äôd say- always really liked Taylor‚Äôs music but never to the extent of trying to go see her live when she‚Äôd come around or dive too deep into her music & lyrics. A casual listener at best probably. BUT I was extremely lucky to have the opportunity to go to Philly night 1 with my cousin who was able to get really awesome tickets, and ever since have 100% been bitten by the Taylor bug and pretty much listen to her every day.
A girl I kinda knew in high school and still see on social media is a big Swiftie and had a speak now (TV) listening party the other night with her friends and it looked so fun! I do not live in the same state as her anymore so I can‚Äôt really reach out to join in on the festivities but would love to do something like that in the future with some people who love Taylor like I do! Especially since 1989 (TV) is probably soon approaching and that album has a special place in my heart as it was the first CD by Taylor Swift I ever got üòä

## Meet Me At Midnight

Do you really wanna know where I was January 6th? On r/popheads, posting this writeup! **Taylor Alison Swift** is the world's biggest Pop Star with a Capital~~ist~~ P‚Ñ¢, although her reputation in this sub is split between camps of swifties who look for every which way to bring her up in threads and haters who... also look for every which way to bring her up in threads. This sub has gone from hating Taylor, loving her, hating her, loving her and now... being sorta like [this](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/44/1d/45/441d451405686aaf504a8b6718fd3d2c.jpg), regardless of how they feel about her.

Taylor Swift's 10th album comes after her greatest critical acclaim ever. *Folklore* made her the first woman to ever win three AOTY Grammys, she won back favour with the general public AND she scored enough indie cred to have an album become that indie record she complained about in *We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together*. *Midnights* had great expectations to live up to, no matter what direction Taylor took the album.

How does one walk the fine line between the quiet introspection, the fictional stories, the maturity of Folklore and the deeply personal, the raw youthfulness, the upbeat pop &amp; country of her previous eras? Taylor also had the expectations of about-facing into the complete opposite of her previous era. Ever since *Fearless*, Taylor Swift‚Äôs eras have been, in some ways, response to critiques and a constant need for female music stars to re-invent themselves. After being derided for having too many songwriters on her AOTY-winning *Fearless*, she wrote the self-written *Speak Now*. However some reviewers saw the album as not having enough growth, so Taylor decided to expand her musical horizons with pop and EDM-infused sounds. And the *Red* \-&gt; *1989* \-&gt; *reputation* \-&gt; *Lover* \-&gt; *folkmore* pipeline has been well documented.

*Midnights* is a result of Taylor deciding to walk further and deeper into her previously told stories, while also continuing the perspective she‚Äôs gained through her pandemic albums. It‚Äôs influenced by her decision to rerecord her old albums; she said the album is inspired by various sleepless nights throughout her life. From staying up contemplating her enemies (*Vigilante Shit*), anxiety (*Labyrinth*), being Very Over Situations (*Karma*), being grateful of finding a true love (*Sweet Nothings*) - the standard edition of the album is full of themes Taylor has written about previously.

The standard edition album is a continuation of the *Lover* instrumentals with flickers of reputation poured in, while the 3 am tracks (mostly collaborated on with Aaron Dessner) are more of a folklore and evermore-vibe. You can practically feel the fingerprints of r/popheads‚Äô faves favourite collaborator, Jack Antonoff, all over the production. 

Lyrically, the album has some of Taylor‚Äôs best pop lyrics. *Midnights* is less purple prose than Folklore and Evermore, but songs like *You're On Your Own Kid, Maroon* and *Paris* manage to paint a story so vividly that it feels like watching a movie. *Anti-Hero*, the album‚Äôs lead single, corrects every wrong that *ME!* had in its lyricism. The chorus hook is perfect for the TikTok era of music. Some of the other lyrics on the album also appear to have been written with TikTok vitality in the back of her head (See: *Question..?* &amp; *Karma*'s choruses). Standout lyrics include:

&gt;*I hosted parties and starved my body // Like I'd be saved by a perfect kiss (You're On Your Own, Kid)*  
&gt;  
&gt;*The rust that grew between telephones // The lips I used to call home // So scarlet, it was maroon (Maroon)*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Your picket fence is sharp as knives // I was dancing around, dancing around it (High Infidelity)*

And where the lyrics somehow don‚Äôt live up to Taylor‚Äôs heigh of greatness, her delivery always saves her. When lyrics started to trickle out prior to release, it was impossible to miss the swiftie meltdowns over *Karma*. People were afraid they‚Äôd have another *ME!* on their hands, only for it to become a genuine fan favourite track. You can always tell that Taylor fully inhabits the mindset of a song when recording vocals, which puts a believability into her performance that few others manage to reach.

If you‚Äôve reached this far into the writeup, you‚Äôve most likely already listened to all 21 tracks, but if you somehow haven‚Äôt: I‚Äôm gonna go deeper into a few of my favourite standouts and hopefully convince you to give them a shot!

## [Bigger Than The Whole Sky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8Tps3PITx4)

Midnights saddest moment comes in the form of this pensive track. Bigger Than The Whole Sky is a song about a profound loss, a loss grater than any other ever felt before. Whether you view the song as being about a miscarriage, life with a past lover, loss of yourself or just general grief, it‚Äôs Taylor‚Äôs most heartbreaking song since Ronan. I‚Äôve seen some swifties interpret it as being about the abruptly ended Lover era, but the emotional through-line seems way deeper than this. BTTWS manages to replicate the feeling you get when grief becomes so ever-encompassing that it feels like your breath has been knocked out of you, the rug pulled out under your very feet.

**Listen if you like**: *More* by Halsey, feeling heartbreaking amounts of sadness, *Fourth of July* by Sufjan Stevens

## [Would‚Äôve, Could‚Äôve, Should‚Äôve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-MfwP_RmHY)

Would‚Äôve, Could‚Äôve, Should‚Äôve is tinged with regret, burning with an undercurrent of rage and a deep feeling of being betrayed by the person you were supposed to trust the most. Taylor looks back at her relationship with John Mayer, a man 13 years her senior, who she dated at age 19. In the Speak Now-track Dear John, she already was aware and angry at the disgusting way he took advantage of her at a young age, while being a grown man in his THIRTIES. In Would‚Äôve, Could‚Äôve, Should‚Äôve, the relationship is like a wound she keeps picking at, the scab never fully forming. The song builds and builds until it comes to a soaring peak in the bridge with a desperate demand of getting her stolen girlhood back.

## [Hits Different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wFESUpwkys)

Have you been screaming, crying, throwing up etc. etc. asking for Taylor to release the 1989-rerecording? Well, seeing as it isn‚Äôt out yet, you‚Äôll have to make do with this! And lucky for you, it‚Äôs exactly everything you would want from a 1989 Vault track! Unluckily for those of us outside the US, it‚Äôs a Target edition exclusive song. It‚Äôs as breezy and carefree as a song about heartbreak can be. In Hits Different, Taylor is stumbling down alleyways and drunkenly crying about her ex. Celebrities: They‚Äôre just like us! The swelling at the end of the track is *chefs kiss*, the crescendo having Taylor worried she‚Äôs gone insane from her broken heart.

Five years ago, John Mayer went on Andy Cohen‚Äôs bravo show (which he‚Äôs done quite frequently as recently as this month) five years ago. John surprised him for his birthday, and romantically serenades him very earnestly with his favorite artist. They DEFINITELY are in love here. It‚Äôs evident in how they look at each other. 

**Then after the serenade they hug and KISS very naturally and Andy calls him ‚Äúsweety.‚Äù**

How does this fit in with gaylor?

Most of Taylor‚Äôs beards and PR boyfriends have had queer rumors from long before she ‚Äúdated‚Äù them. Many people think the songs Dear John, Would‚Äôve Could‚Äôve Should‚Äôve, ATW10, I knew you were trouble, ours, superman, and more have to be about John because of the public narrative. **I‚Äôm not discounting they could both be bi, and it‚Äôs not biphobic for anyone to think they‚Äôre both gay/lesbian.** Not discounting she could‚Äôve been majorly wronged by him in another way either, but those songs were much more likely to be about her ex girlfriends Emily and Liz imo. He‚Äôs just an easy scapegoat that covers her bases on the descriptions of her own exes/real muses: dark hair (liz), gap teeth (liz), she was 19 and they were much older with a tumultuous and emotionally toxic relationship (emily). 

But Taylor continuing to bait fans with thinking they‚Äôre about him makes both of them look like they could be attracted to the opposite gender forever. **It seals in their perceived heterosexuality.** But Taylor even implied recently Dear John isn‚Äôt even about John by asking people to ‚ÄúExtend your kindness to the internet and please do not go after anyone because you think I wrote a song about them a billion years ago.‚Äù during the eras show where she sang Dear John as a surprise song. I think he was a beard and they probably didn‚Äôt know the other was queer and it was set up for PR.

21988,"Hi all,

As alot of you may know the other day taylor announced her Europe leg of the eras tour. My girlfriend has been begging me to take her. Only problem being... I dont know alot about taylor swift or her music. I know the popular songs that everyone and their dogs know, but alot of the other songs i dont. 

&#x200B;

These gigs arent exactly short either so i dont want to be sitting there for 3 hours till i hear the songs i know. These tickets arent cheap either so i dont really want to take abi if i wont enjoy it. The main reason i want to go is so i can propose to her during love story. However i could also propose when we go see twentyonepilots next time they tour.  

&#x200B;

So i have 2 questions:  
Would the eras tour be worth it for someone like me?

How much have people payed \*roughly\* to see taylor on this tour and where were you in the arena?

30515,"Indeed, even amid a record-breaking tour, Taylor just doesn‚Äôt stop let up with her musical output. Because of the amount of music she‚Äôs released this year, I thought it‚Äôd be fun to have a best/worst to look back on.

Disclaimer: This is *my* personal list. You are welcome to agree/disagree and share yours!

&#x200B;

**Best**

You‚Äôre Losing Me

&#x200B;

* While I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of the production, I think this is one of her best written songs in a while; her adult All Too Well, if you will.
* I also love that extended bridge too: *Do something babe, risk something‚Ä¶* 

Is It Over Now?

&#x200B;

* It didn‚Äôt grab me upon first listen, but it slowly crept up to becoming one of my favorite vault tracks
* Such a catchy chorus melody and the production feels the most like 1989: bombastic, cathartic.

Back to December TV

&#x200B;

* I could really feel the lyrics more now that a mature Swift is singing them; there‚Äôs just a wistfulness to her delivery now
* Plus the strings are soooooo good

&#x200B;

**Worst**

Suburban Legends

&#x200B;

* I think the lyrics are cute, but it doesn‚Äôt sound like 1989 at all. As what others have mentioned, it fits the vibe of Midnights more
* The melodies also aren‚Äôt that memorable; feels like it was improvised than crafted

&#x200B;

Karma Remix

&#x200B;

* Probably not an unpopular opinion. I like Ice Spice‚Äôs verse, but she and Taylor just don‚Äôt have the chemistry",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/18l6c1u/your_best_and_worst_taylor_swift_songs_of_2023/,Your Best and Worst Taylor Swift Songs of 2023,TaylorSwift,t3_18l6c1u,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/18l6c1u/your_best_and_worst_taylor_swift_songs_of_2023/,2023-12-18 11:17:03,Taylor Swift

30572,"You know when someone says ""I'm in my \_\_\_ era"", what does each era mean to you? For me...

Being in your Debut era is when your love life is all over the place, maybe you're visiting your hometown, you're maybe being a bit naive or potentially unhinged. 

Being in your Fearless era is when you've maybe been in some toxic relationships, but you're young, you're free, you feel like you have all the time in the world, and at the end of the day you're optimistic for the future. And possibly a bit crazy...

Being in your Speak Now era is when you're a potentially naive hopeless romantic with big dreams who wears their heart on their sleeve and is eventually heartbroken (I thought I was in my 1989 era but actually this sounds a lot more like me...)

Being in your Red era is when you've had your heart broken more than it ever has been before and you go from being absolutely devastated to healing and getting over them by having fun with your friends and other people.

Being in your 1989 era is when you're learning to be more independent, your love life is all over the place, you're going through a big change and learning to adjust to it, whether that's moving to the big city, going through a breakup, finding new friends, whatever. And you're just gonna have fun!

Being in your reputation era is NOT when you're becoming a vengeful dark feminine energy girlboss, being in your reputation era is finding the strongest love in a time you thought you never could. You've gone through a tough time but you emerged ""doing better than I ever was"" with someone you're hopelessly in love with and connected to.

Being in your Lover era is settling into a long term relationship and starting to daydream about your wedding day realistically, but your insecurities and anxieties are still sitting in the back of your head about how they're going to leave you and that you're not good enough for them. (My reasoning for this is mostly Cornelia Street and Afterglow)

Being in your folklore era can be one of 2 things: either you have an extremely overactive imagination and spend your days away in another world daydreaming stories (me irl) OR you're going through a terrible heartbreak/mental health crisis.

Being in your evermore era is similar: either you're a girl/guy who lives in delusion, thinking up fake scenarios about your life, or you're beginning to process and heal from whatever it was in your folklore era that had you so depressed (but like you're still pretty damn hurt).

Being in your Midnights era is when you're thinking back to all the past times in your life and wondering what happened to your previous self and if that's still you. For when you're thinking back to times of crisis in your past and realising it either doesn't affect you anymore or it really wasn't that deep.

What era are you in? Do you think being in an era means something different to what I think? I think part of it depends on whether you're basing the era vibes off of the persona in the album or the person writing the album. Particularly with folkmore, being in your imagination with fake scenarios is more from the perspective of the person writing the album, while being depressed/recovering is the album narrator.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/18mtq6v/what_does_being_in_each_era_mean_for_you/,What does being in each era mean for you?,TaylorSwift,t3_18mtq6v,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/18mtq6v/what_does_being_in_each_era_mean_for_you/,2023-12-20 12:43:11,Taylor Swift

I‚Äôve always felt so deeply connected to her because of her lyrics. I also absolutely love going to concerts, but I am used to going to smaller venues. I can go to a concert for someone I don‚Äôt know at all and it almost always still feels so special. I was so bummed to feel that the Eras tour left me feeling more disconnected to her than ever. So far, since I haven‚Äôt seen her live, our (albeit parasocial) relationship was just our relationship. But seeing her so small on a stage and barely hearing her voice instead of thousands of other fans just made it feel so distant for me. It made me sad. 

Also I didn‚Äôt like this idea that it was her putting on a show. She is a performer so I understand why it is this way but I just feel like she could literally just sing all her songs and not put on a show at all and it would be perfect. I saw her in Seattle and so maybe it‚Äôs because she‚Äôs not as into it as she originally was cause she‚Äôs so far into the tour but it just seemed fake to me.

28293,"A lyric I missheard made cowboy like me one of my favourite songs and now I refuse to acknowledge the original

Okay, I'm a baby swiftie and spanish is my first language. So a few months ago I listened to cowboy like me, and I LOVED IT. My favorite part was obviously the bridge, and while I get how the 2 most loved lyrics are ""Now you hang from my lips like the gardens of babylon"" and ""forever is the sweetest con"", I was obsessed with the line in the middle.

WHICH I HEARED LIKE ""Put your boots beneath my bed"". It was just so poetic to me. Like, she knows that they are both cowboys, criminals, but she invites the other person to enter her house with their cowboy clothes and rest without the boots, to establish together despite of their criminal/cowboy nature. And she proposes it smoothly, and instantly acknowledges that establishment and forecer are just cons like the ones they are used to do. But she still wants it.

So, imagine how DEVASTATED I was when I discovered that the real lyrics are ""WITH you boots beneath my bed"". It's just. It's so casual, it's telling it hapenned without giving ot that much of a thought. She's no longer asking them to establish, or to just give her the feeling of establishment even if they still are cowboys. It's a good lyric, but it's just... so much underwhelming.

So I just refuse to acknowledge it! The other one gives so much feeling to the song in my eyes.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/17djs9h/i_missheard_my_favourite_lyric_from_cowboy_like_me/,I missheard my favourite lyric from cowboy like me,TaylorSwift,t3_17djs9h,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/17djs9h/i_missheard_my_favourite_lyric_from_cowboy_like_me/,2023-10-22 03:09:22,Taylor Swift

13370,I reordered most of the songs. I kept the first couple songs because they are punchy and ironic but wanted to keep that energy just a little longer so I moved up Ballad. I then wanted to transition into something more contemplative so I moved the slower songs into the middle and arranged them after Ballad into Pretty showing the world is already stacked against her. And her reaction is to turn to Lacy. But it just leads to more her trauma which she feels responsible for in Bed and her unwillingness to forgive her wrong-doers in Grudge. Then transitioning from melancholy upping the energy Vampire does a really good job of connecting those two because it reinforces her grudge. She‚Äôs kind of Embarrassed and vengeful. But ultimately realizing it wasn‚Äôt meant to be a Teenage Dream.

33278,"Following Miley Cryus‚Äô divorce from Liam Hemsworth, her partner of 10 years, the pop star linked her personal and professional life together. On *Plastic Hearts*, Cyrus found comfort in pinning her frank confessions against a gritty backdrop of rough rock. On *Flowers*, the lead single for her upcoming album, Miley is still reflecting on the fallout of their break up, but she has shifted soundscapes. ‚ÄúYeah, I can love me better than you can,‚Äù Cyrus sings, hinting that she‚Äôs in a peaceful state, but the vacuous, glossy dance beat dampens any notes of real gratification. 

The chorus of *Flowers* bears a striking resemblance to Bruno Mars‚Äô *When I Was Your Man*, both lyrically and melodically. Neither of these songs caters to their performer's readily flexible voices, but *Flowers*, in particular, is flat. ‚ÄúTalk to myself for hours (Yeah)/Say things you don't understand,‚Äù croons Cyrus on the hook. The decision to swap her usual bombastic voice for a sheepish accent is an odd one, especially considering just how much of the song Cyrus dedicates to celebrating self-love and being autonomous.

In the past, Cyrus has, with mixed effect, wholeheartedly pivoted between genres. On *Flowers* though, the funk elements are light and soporific. You‚Äôve heard Cyrus own the dance floor before, but this is no sharp, synth-infused experiment like the watt-produced *Midnight Sky* or the romping Mark Ronson-assisted *Nothing Breaks Like a Heart*. It just exists.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/10bd0so/miley_cyrus_flowers_is_flat_single_review/,Miley Cyrus‚Äô Flowers Is Flat - Single Review,Music,t3_10bd0so,/r/Music/comments/10bd0so/miley_cyrus_flowers_is_flat_single_review/,2023-01-14 02:30:09,Miley Cyrus

5114,"I think 'Taylor Swift' is a brand with a very curated image - and I also think Taylor knew very well how parasocial relationships can affect a celebrity's relevance, reputation, and legacy. Hold a few secret sessions here, remember a few fans there, get your team to be active enough on socials to notice who's really gaining popularity amongst the Swifties, and boom. I'm not saying I think she doesn't care about her fans, but there's just no way she didn't once think about how this would benefit her business-wise and image-wise. 

Now, onto Mastermind. I never thought Mastermind was about Joe, or any of her romantic (real, alleged, beards, whatever) partners. She sings the song while pointing out towards the crowd and rotating in a circle to make sure she points at EVERYONE in the stadium, including the ones behind the stage. The song is a confession. She feels guilty for curating these relationships and ideas of her - but why? I really don't believe she'd write a song confessing to not actually caring about her fans, because I think it's clear that she does at least a little bit. So why does she feel guilty? Unless the image she projects is, of course, false to some extent. Sometimes when someone come out, the people they come out to are mad that they took so long to say something, or that they kept a secret from them for so long. They feel like the person who came out was hiding something from them and that they aren't the person they recognize anymore.

31148,"Hi everyone, I'm heavily considering buying a $200 GA ticket to go to Music Midtown in Atlanta, primarily to see Billie Eilish. Given where I live, this is my only chance to watch her perform until presumably after she releases her next album (which could be 2025). I've never been to a huuuge festival or concert before, so I would appreciate if I could get some insight:

1) How long do you think I'd have to stand at Billie's stage to get a decent spot? Should I head over there as soon as the gates open, or could I show up and get a spot a few hours before her performance? I don't need to be at the barricade, but I definitely want to try to be in the first few rows.

2) When will the festival generally release the performance schedule for each day?

3) How long is her setlist? I want to make sure this is worth the money and time.

To me, this is Taylor seeing Joe (an actor, on the screens) as an opportunity and having an idea, she can use this image of being with Joe to more effectively hide what she really wants and who she really is. Through that image she can have her safety and stay hidden in her lavender haze. I mean she crawls through a field of lavender to get to him !!!!!!!

3792,"Wanted to discuss in general who was a beard and who isn't so bear with me & my thoughts

Men i think they're beards vs men i think were real relationships for taylor:

Real:

Joe Jonas (didn't realise she was gayy at the time)

Taylor Launter (started realising)

John m*yer (fucking gr00mer )

Jake gyllenhal (i think she truly loved him)

Beard:

Harry styles (even if she was straight this relationship is pure PR you can't convince me otherwise)

Calvin Harris (i think he was supposed to be a long time beard but they had some problems aka the whole this is what you came for thing and they decided to end it)


No idea:

Tom hiddleston : i have 2 thoughts, 1 is after she broke up with karlie she wanted to date a man as maybe a form of spiraling or change or smth and tom is literally a sweetheart and in their photos they actually have chemistry unlike hers with the other beards, but people are saying she broke up with karlie around 2019 so idk honestly but she was married then and i truly think what her and josh have is real as they have a child, so if they actually broke up around 2016 but remained friends tom could may be real.
If they were still together he was definitely a beard..


Joe alwyn: welllll idk part of me believes that why would she bother having a beard that is that irrelevant and that actually making her hide from the people, like is it worth it for someone you have no love for? Also some of her songs do fit him quiet well so i really can't tell, but they literally have no chemistry in any of their photos..


Anyways, if what i think is correct and removing tom and joe from the equation blondie hasn't dated a guy since jake gyllenhal so yeah she can be a lesbian but thought she was bi before 1989 era, or she could be bi and had some real relationships with men in the middle but she prefers women.

At the risk of sounding like an overbearing parent, your mods ask that you PLEASE use your own discretion when scheduling a meetup. Vegas is a very busy city with lots of wild characters. Tips to stay safe:

1. Meet in a public place.
2. Do not give out your hotel or room number.
3. Be cautious of who you add on some social media. Some social media (like Snapchat's Snapmap) can share your location to friends.
4. Always keep your drink(s) in your line-of-sight and don't take drinks (or anything else-- it's Vegas after all) from someone you just met, unless you see them get it from the bar.

3938,"What is the great war/battle Taylor keeps referring to? It looks like Kaylor broke up for good in Summer 2016 and Tay started hooking up with Lily, to then become serious with Lily from Nov 2016 to 2019 (with a few breaks along the way - Tay's Ruby Rose era for example). But for Taylor, Lily was End Game and they were the A team. I believe Lily is the London lover and the folklore/evermore main muse.

Tay was planning to soft launch her queerness for Lover/Miss Americana, got spooked by the pushback to the leak about her and Katy Perry kissing in the YNTCD video, then the masters heist happened 2 days later. Scooter's purchase is known to be part funded by Kushner's Carlyle group. Taylor backed out of coming out and reworked her doco to erase that.

Lily deleted the ‚ÄúAT‚Äù and red heart emoji from her 2016 birthday post for Taylor in early January 2020. Taylor then released ""The Man"" on Lily's birthday later that January.

Lily was rumored to be a yacht girl, if you know what that implies. Taylor had spoiled her in the early years with Bulgari snake jewelry but Lily wanted an actual commitment (both financial and romantic), not to just be her secret girlfriend. Lily had kept the billionaire yacht oner Alshair Fiyaz on her radar as a backup and left Tay in the wake of the Master's heist/re-closeting to be with Fiyaz and have his baby (I have photo proof of Lily's baby bump in July 2020 and there is a video of Lily dancing at Fiyaz's St Tropez Polo Club on the club's instagram in 2021).

What if Kushner wasn't the only financier of the heist, what if Fiyaz was part of the funding in order to win the VS model he had wanted for years? 

I have a conspiracy theory that Taylor knew Fiyaz was part of this plan and provided evidence about Fiyaz's involvement in an Insider trading case that came out in the wake of the master's heist - like in Karma.

In *hoax*, Taylor says ""You know you won so what's the point of keeping score"" which feels like a pun (score=music/her masters). 

In *gold rush* Taylor expresses her disdain for Lily to be so mercenary, when Taylor's love was so pure. However later on in *cowboy like me*, she imagines herself at Lily's wedding at the Polo Club (the tent over the tennis court) perched on a horse admiring the hustle of her ex love. Afterall, Taylor knows what it's like to schmooze industry people to get what she wants. They really are alike, but will never ride off into the sunset together on her 'fancy car' (horse) and Taylor will instead 'pay for it' with her mental health. Lily is a known horse girl.

Unrelated note: the line 'ladies lunching' in *cowboy like me* is the funniest way to refer to the other rich lesbians like Rihanna Lily used to date before her. I think we know what they are lunching.

27038,"What are your experiences as a Swiftie that have left you feeling kinda guilty, even if you really had no practical reason to? 

For example, I felt really bad for no reason about not liking the Miss Americana doc's second half for a while (I'm not from America and I was younger, so her political messages didn't quite resonate with me at the time), especially when I thought it seemed so important to talk about and a great move on her part. I appreciate all of it now as much as I possibly can, of course, but I felt kinda bad at the time. 

I just really think all of us are different people, and no one's journey is the same, even when united by a common fandom. These 'guilt-trip' moments only emphasize our individuality and diverse opinions, and the little bit of humanity that comes with it.

4372,"So, I am very much a gaylor but not totally immersed in all the different theories so please pardon me if this has already been discussed or theorized on. 

The other day I was listening to Ivy and my mind began to wander. What if the house of stone that Taylor sings about is the Lover home? As in she‚Äôs been in this big house she built singing about men, but one woman comes along and changes everything? As in infiltrates the lover house and it becomes theirs. My mind was just going so I called my best friend and told her my thoughts. She said she‚Äôd ponder it too and get back to me. 

This morning she suggested that maybe the Lover house is her home with a man, but the folklore/evermore cabin is where Taylor escapes to to be happy in her ‚Äúcottage core fantasy.‚Äù (Lesbians love cottage core, right?) These were my best friend‚Äôs words:

‚ÄúWhen we talked the other day, I had the thought ‚Äúwell the only house we have is the lover house‚Äù and this morning I remembered the folklore/evermore cabin.

If we are going to assign the Ivy girl a house here‚Äôs sort of how I see it:
For some reason in my mind the lover house seems to be where the Ivy girl lives full time with her husband (furnished, they would have friends over, parties, all her stuff is there, etc). 
And the folklore/evermore cabin would be where she would go to spend time with the woman she loves. It‚Äôs more intimate/private/secluded + their love is forbidden so they can‚Äôt be seen by the husband. So that cabin could be their hideaway. The cabin vibe just seems more cozy/woodsy which gives me the same vibe as the song Ivy.

And then maybe the lyric ‚Äúhe‚Äôs gonna burn this house to the ground‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt mean the husband is going to try to rip apart the affair relationship. Maybe instead it means he would burn down everything that he and the Ivy girl built together (the lover house!!!) and her reputation. 

And (that‚Äôs why) ivy is a song on the album evermore not the album lover.‚Äù

So, maybe we are being delulu but this is our theory and I‚Äôm going to fully jump into it and believe it as canon now but I would love to hear others‚Äô thoughts! üíö

5595,"A lot of gaylors have referenced Cruel Summer as being a queer coded song and I always wondered why. I always thought, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs nothing outstandingly queer about this song, it just seems like someone who is trying to play it cool with the person they are having a summer fling with but she‚Äôs very into him‚Äù. Well, cue light bulb moment as I was driving home from the beach this morning!!!!

I always thought the chorus lyrics were structured like this:

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs new
The shape of your body, its blue
The feeling I got and its oooooooh
It‚Äôs a cruel summer

It‚Äôs cool
That‚Äôs what I tell him, no rules
In breakable heaven‚Äù

BUT IT ONLY JUST OCCURRED TO ME THAT THEY ARE IN FACT, STRUCTURED LIKE THIS:

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs new, the shape of your body
It‚Äôs blue, the feeling I got
And it‚Äôs ooooooooh
It‚Äôs a cruel summer

It‚Äôs cool, that‚Äôs what I tell him
No rules, in breakable heaven
But ooooh‚Ä¶‚Äù etc etc 

So what I‚Äôm trying to say is I always thought it was ‚Äúthe shape of your body, its blue‚Äù (never understood that and it completely went over my head) rather than ‚ÄúITS NEW, THE SHAPE OF YOUR BODY‚Äù which might possibly be the gayest lyric ever written.

I recently started [a project](https://medium.com/swiftian-studies) to deep-dive analyze the lyrics of every single Taylor Swift song, in an order inspired by the Eras structure, which is to say not remotely chronological. I realized after the fact that both of the songs I've written posts for so far, ""Better Than Revenge"" and ""This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things,"" are songs in which Taylor goes full disappointed parent/teacher mode, scolding someone who's done her wrong.

I'm not just referring to songs that have to do with someone else's bad behavior or someone letting her down, but specifically ones where she's got that chastising tone‚Äîlike a mix of disappointment, authority, condescension, discipline, moral superiority, etc...

It's a difficult mode to pull off successfully! I think TIWWCHNT totally nails it because it's so fun and doesn't take itself seriously, but I know a lot of Swifties hate this song. I think the original Better Than Revenge veered into the cringy category, but her more mature vocals on TV saves it. Girl at Home, IMO, is scolding done badly (though I've always loved the melody of that song, especially with the original production). In terms of breakup songs, ""Babe"" is the first one that comes to mind where it feels like she's *scolding* an ex for his bad decisions, rather than just calling them out/explaining how it hurt her, etc.

Can you think of other songs or individual lines with this tone? What do you think about them? Do they come off as patronizing, righteous, or funny?

When I went to rep, we had floor seats and we saw people who purposefully placed themselves in aisles and back behind crowds in hopes that they‚Äôd get tapped by TN or Andrea to meet Taylor. Idk, something about it rubbed me the wrong way. Everyone should do them, but it felt like they prioritized a chance to meet her over enjoying the show experience. It seemed like a waste of time to me, at least. There‚Äôs 70,000 people there! What‚Äôs the likelihood that‚Äôll work? 

And before every tour, there‚Äôs countless threads about ‚Äúhow to meet Taylor‚Äù or the best way to ‚Äúget seen‚Äù by a member of her team. Most of which included spending an ungodly amount of money on certain seats, elaborate costumes and signage, etc. It then becomes a contest of how much money you can spend.

It‚Äôs awesome that people have gotten that opportunity, but I feel like it cheapens the experience of meeting her and turns it into some kind of competition or sport.

27809,"If you weren't allowed to listen to all her albums anymore but rather just your own created album consisting of one song from every existing Taylor Swift album, which songs would you choose? Additionally you can also add a Taylor Song which is not on one of her albums as a bonus track. You can just choose your favourite song from each album but you can also choose the songs in a way where the album makes sense for you. Have fun :)

My album would be:

1. Teardrops On My Guitar 

2. You're Not Sorry 

3. Long Live 

4. All Too Well (10 Minute Version)

5. Blank Space 

6. Don't Blame Me 

7. Cornelia Street 

8. Cardigan 

9. Champagne Problems 

10. Would've Could've Should've

First off, **thank you** for getting us to over 21,000 Livies in our subreddit community! We appreciate all the love and respect you help give this fan community on Reddit to make it welcoming and safe for Livies to join and dive into. With your help and deciding to click the join, you help make this subreddit more visible when others search for Olivia on Reddit!  


For those new here, this subreddit community is meant to be a **SFW** subreddit community for all Livies to enjoy without having to deal any unwanted NSFW, creepy, or suggestive content and comments being posted. With your help of reporting content when you see them, we can help to ensure that this place stays that way. We have no plans in changing or allowing NSFW or such here.   


If you're reading this before the **'vampire'** single release, you can expect the main big discussion thread to go up on Thursday, June 29th around 9:00 AM ET/6 AM PT. This is to accommodate Livies living in earlier time zones who might have access to the song earlier than the rest of the world and to prevent too many of the same posts. Don't be alarmed if you think the song released already and can't see it, it's likely not released for you yet. Feel free to also grab the new 'vampire' user flairs to flaunt in the subreddit!  


We've updated and rearranged the subreddit's rules and have made it more clearer on how to handle and post other social media content here. This seems to be the biggest rule offender and we don't mean to take down posts on these non-malicious posts and would like to mediate the process. Hopefully this brings more clarity when posting. Rule 5 is titled as ""Properly Post & Credit Social Media Content"" and is listed as:

* When posting content from a different social media platform (Instagram, TikTok, etc.), please post a downloaded version of it or a cleanly cropped screenshot and post that instead.
* You must also make sure to **link to the original post** in the comment section of your post submission or some other variation for others to use for easy reference.  


And finally, with the release of 'vampire' and 'GUTS' and new merch, we will be bringing back the merch megathreads! Please try to read and use these first before defaulting to creating an individual post for your merch related inquiries.

22000,"Ok, I am in no way a swiftie, but my friend challenged me to go through the entire discography to *force* myself to become one. She bribed me with my favorite snickerdoodles and I'm a sugar addict so I took her up on it. I spent a couple days of my free time going through everything and now I have very strong opinions of taylor swift music, so my friend told me to share these here with you!

First, I LOVE reputation. I know a lot of people are turned off by the dark nature, but only three or four songs are actually about the whole revenge theme. The rest are cynical love songs about romance that might be doomed, and I love it. Just a thought though: So It Goes...? Not the biggest fan. TIWWCHNT was a bit much for me. KOMH is my fave (followed by Dress, Getaway Car, Delicate, End Game bc of Ed Sheeran, and Don't Blame Me). stunning album, i could have that voice playing on repeat for a week

lover: spectacular songs, and then terrible songs. I think he knows, I forgot you existed, the man, YNTCD, INTHAF all deserve to burn in hell. I don't know why, but they are just so annoying. HOWEVER, cruel summer, MA&THP, AOTGYLB, paper rings, need (unreleased) are sooo pretty. DBATC was too light and sunny for such a dark title. too many skips for me overall

red: last summer, a friend found out that i wasn't a ts fan and demanded i put red tv on my spotify. one day, i decided to listen to it and put it on shuffle. i did not enjoy it. at all. ATW 10 min, while pretty, is not for me, and i couldn't get into anything else really.

debut: i know she was young when she recorded it, but her voice is just...sigh. couldn't get into it. picture to burn and should've said no were too childish. only tim mcgraw and TOMG were good, but then again, i'm not much of a country girl

fearless: YBWM and love story are iconic. I love them. i also love mr perfectly fine and the way i love you. Maybe I'll find others I like, but for now, I'm not exactly going to stream fearless on repeat.

folklore & evermore: stripped back indie style that i like in many other artists, so theoretically i should like it in these. actual assessment: meh. Cardigan was great, August didn't really connect with me(but I just heard the TSITP version and loved it so once that is released I will be streaming it), and Betty wasn't as cohesive and mature as those two. warmed up to champagne problems. love gold rush (except for the intro and outro, the song is already short and it legit takes out 40 seconds for awful vocals). no body, no crime gives reputation but stripped and i adore it. overall pretty decent, but not my go to.

speak now: somehow her voice sounds less mature than fearless. i didn't like dear john as much as they said i would. I didn't like Back to December as much as they said I would. I didn't like Speak Now as much as they said I would. I didn't like Sparks Fly as much as they said I would. I like Mean from my childhood so that was a fun listen. Enchanted was pretty on tiktok audios, but seemed worse with the studio version. I'm hoping the re recorded version makes her voice sound more mature so I can listen to that instead.

better than revenge...sigh. catchy as hell. petty as hell. slut shames like hell. treats men like objects that can't think for themselves like hell. if it was written by a man slut shaming women and treating women like trophies, it would be canceled like hell. has women across the internet denounce feminism for a 3 min song demonizing a girl for simply dating a guy she liked like hell. Ultimately, this song made me lose so much respect for her. I had always thought, despite not being a fan, that she got too much hate. listening to this made me understand exactly why some people think she is a b\*tch...because she writes like one. the only redeeming quality would be if the rerecord drastically changed the lyrics, so we'll see what happens

midnights: pop album that rocked the world. my world? not so much. Antihero was disappointingly pop and not dark like I expected. bejeweled and karma were kinda annoying. lavender haze? kind of mid-tier. maroon, great war, WCS were redeemers though. midnight rain should've had another verse or a bridge. Right now it seems like a half done song. ultimately a disappointing album for Past Me trying desperately to become a swiftie.

So here are my unpopular opinions. Let me know your thoughts and if there are any songs I should check out, particularly if they give the lover-reputation vibe.

edit: just realized i forgot 1989, so here it is:

loved the singles. they will forever be iconic. (wildest dreams is my favorite, but blank space closely follows). i did not like out of the woods and new romantics that much for some reason. i know places, however, is stunning. bad blood, while definitely good, struck me as the kind of song you get tired of listening to too often. the rest kind of fell flat to me though. i know back in the day this was, like, a revolutionary album, but right now after listening to her whole discography, i don't feel it that much. i feel like lover, midnights, and rep did pop songs much better. maybe this is just her getting better as the years progress, but i really didn't see why it is her most popular album.

also, a note with btr: i understand the context behind it, and i know how it may have colored a young women's view of the situation. i also understand that the late 2000s weren't the greatest time for toxic attitudes regarding dating. let me be clear, i also disapprove of other songs with similar rhetoric, with both men and women as the narrators and subjects. however, context doesn't excuse actions (if it did, how easy would it be to disapprove problematic behaviors due to the time period? is it ok to be racist if the time period allows it? just a thought) and we have to look at it from an unbiased lens.

I did some digging when i heard the song to find the background info and discovered that taylor swift was interviewed about the problematic nature of the lyrics. her response? i'm paraphrasing ofc, but she said that she was 19 when she wrote it and that she has since figured out that a man cannot be ""stolen"" away unless he really wanted to leave. spot-on and accurate conclusion, but that's it. she doesn't address the slut shaming, or treating boyfriends like trophies utilized in pissing contests, or anything else. she leaves it at that. if she had addressed the other, much more problematic aspects of the song, i could've probably excused it. but instead, she pivoted. so that just really turned me off to it. thank you for listening to my ted talk",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/14gt7wa/my_bestie_challenged_me_to_become_a_swiftie_here/,"My bestie challenged me to become a Swiftie, here are my controversial opinions:",TaylorSwift,t3_14gt7wa,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/14gt7wa/my_bestie_challenged_me_to_become_a_swiftie_here/,2023-06-23 08:45:49,Taylor Swift

2856,"I enjoy K-Pop, but don't interact with it much, however, I've seen a lot of posts of the absolutely unbelievable before and after plastic surgery comparisons for other Idols, and it's always very noticeable that they have had a lot of work done, even for those who didn't change much.

That said, I've seen so many ""before and after debut"" comparisons for NewJeans and it seems that none of them have had much if any work done, because they look very, very similar. It looks like it's more just a matter of now having professional makeup artists doing their makeup rather than having had loads of plastic surgery.

Do we know of any of the NewJeans members having had plastic surgery? I haven't seen any convincing ""proof"", but I also understand that it's rarer for an idol to be natural than to have had surgery.

Asking purely out of interest, they're still all very pretty independent of if they had surgery or not, I just found it interesting that unlike most other groups where there's at least one person who has noticeably had a lot of work done, NewJeans all look very, very similar to their older pictures.",https://www.reddit.com/r/NewJeans/comments/157wk68/plastic_surgery/,Plastic Surgery,NewJeans,t3_157wk68,/r/NewJeans/comments/157wk68/plastic_surgery/,2023-07-24 01:35:24,New Jeans

22170,"I'm really bad at vocalizing my emotions and it's something I'm still learning, even though I'm nearing 30s. I've always loved writing so I sometimes write short sentences or even poems that help me with what I'm feeling.

That being said, music has tremendous impact on my emotions. I sometimes love ""stupid"" lyrics to just have fun, but I also love hearing lyrics that truly hit home, whether I'm feeling happy, or sad, or angry.

Taylor's music has helped me a lot in the past, and ever since Midnights came out, I've used her music to process the feelings of rejection, insecurities, past mistakes, hopes and dreams and everything in between, to the point where some of my friends have noticed a healthy shift in the way I react to what goes on in my life.

For example, Anti-Hero is one of those songs that I like listening for fun, but it also kind of snaps me back into reality with the lines *I'll stare directly at the Sun but never in the mirror* much like The Archer's *And I cut of my nose just to spite my face, then hate my reflection for years and years*. 

I'm currently dealing with being dumped but I saw it coming for the last little while, and Taylor's songs have helped me immensely so that now it hurts a bit less since I knew it was going to happen and I managed to process it a lot earlier.

18995,"It may sound odd but musicians and bands appearing in their own comic book or even with guest appearances has been happening at least since the 60s, though the most famous example that actually made headlines at the time was when KISS and Marvel teamed up to introduce the band as super heroes in the Marvel Universe with the initial issue being printed with ink mixed with vials of blood from the four original members of the band.

Since then other names like Alice Cooper; who worked with NEIL GAIMAN to adapt his concept  album The Last Temptation into a comic; Iron Maiden, Dio, and Slayer having licensed books based on concepts from their iconography and themes from certain albums.  Even more moderns bands like Halestorm have done this.

Then there are are some like Gerard Way and Tom Morello who have released their own stories that are quite separate from their musical endeavors.

And sometimes they're totally autobiographical or career retrospectives, like Moonage Daydream; a book about the first half of David Bowie's career, and The Illustrated Al which was illustrated by various artists as a song by song retrospective of Weird Al Yankovic's career.

So, if Taylor were to go on this path, would it be something you'd be interesting in seeing? And what path would you want taken? Casting herself in a story? Maybe an adaptation of folklore or evermore? Use another album or song as inspiration for an entire story? Or something wholly original and not connected to anything she's done previously?

Personally I'd be interested regardless as I find it a fascinating thing and kind of surprised it's not done a bit more by artists in general. However I do think how Weird Al did it would be interesting, where different artists come together to interpret selected songs. I also think Al hand selected the artists as well. And if that were the case I'd love to see DC be the one she worked with just to have access to some of the exclusive artists they have like Jim Lee, Nicola Scott, Dan Mora, Ivan Reis, Todd Nauck...it'd be a fun project.

25078,"1. **Welcome To New York:** A co-write with OneRepublic's Ryan Tedder. This is the opening track because 1989 was a transformative era for Taylor. She cut her hair short, ditched the ""teardrops on my guitar"" country girl aesthetic and modernised her sound/image. She moved to New York, something she'd wanted to do for a while, even referenced it in Mean (""someday I'll be living in a big ol' city"" as a backdrop of NY appears behind her in the music video). The album, and this song, signifies change in sound, location and outlook. It was also significant because of the lyric ""you can want who you want/boys and boys and girls and girls"". It was still a big deal for celebrities to show LGBTQIA+ support at the time, if you can imagine! (Same sex marriage wasn't even legalised yet!) and there was some surprise she included the lyric, probably from the ongoing assumption that she was more conservative (and her country background).
2. **Blank Space:** This song tackles the media narrative of ""Careful, she'll write a song about you!"" and ""She intentionally destroys relationships for songs"". In 2012/2013, that narrative had quickly turned from a light in-joke she was okay with telling to legitimate backlash and a way for people to undermine or handwave her artistry. So she took the backlash and, in a similar move to adopting the snake imagery for Reputation, said ""Well let's see what that would look like if it were somehow true/the real me"". At the time, ""Darling I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream"" was considered an iconic lyric and the song was/is considered an example of her best songwriting.
3. **Style:** Yes, this song is about Harry *Style*s. She can be seen holding his paper airplane necklace at the beginning and end of the music video. She explained the song was about someone you're never truly done with, as she was still privately/casually seeing Harry during 2013-2014. A few songs on 1989 establish this (as does the album's secret message, I'll post that at the end).
4. **Out of the Woods:** This song marks the arrival of the Jack Antonoff/Taylor Swift musical chemistry we know and love today. Yes, they'd done Sweeter Than Fiction prior to this but this album is where Taylor and Jack solidified their musical bond/sound. This song is again about Harry, from the perspective of hindsight. Looking back at the fast paced relationship and noticing all the mistakes or things she needn't have worried about at the time (""the monsters turned out to be just trees""). Similar to All Too Well, she uses ""I remember"", ""I remember thinking"" as a storytelling device. This is also one of the first songs where fans began to emphasise how amazing her bridges were. Lyrically, she references the snowmobile crash she and Harry had, where he had to get stitches in his chin and is speculated by fans to be the ""ok fun is over"" point of the relationship where Harry began to drift away and things weren't quite the same again. There's a neat double meaning in ""Remember when we hit the brakes too soon?"" - both the literal snowmobile brakes that caused the crash, and Harry leaving seemingly at random while on holiday with her in January 2013, after a year of pining for each other in 2012, only to come back *again* some time later in 2013. The song was used in early promo for the album. She performed it many times in the lead-up to 1989's release, despite it not being an official single until the end of 2015. The music video is also one of the first times I can remember the easter eggs really becoming a thing, I remember her on Tumblr praising everyone for picking up on a number of things.
5. **All You Had To Do Was Stay:** Taylor has described how the song came to her because she had a dream that her voice was unusually high pitched and all she could say was ""stay!"". I think this song is again speaking to Harry about his initial hasty exit.
6. **Shake It Off:** Can you believe there was discourse around this music video? Shake It Off was an instant signature song/hit with the locals overnight. Again it works into the new outlook of ""I'm not that sad girl anymore!"" and tries to playfully address the talking points about her image/dating life/personality/awkwardness etc. Right when it was a huge inescapable radio hit, people began to take issue with the twerking in the video, saying Taylor was making fun of black culture, despite all the diversity present in the music video otherwise. This was one year after Miley's infamous VMA performance and right at the same time as Nicki Minaj's Anaconda was released). What's more likely to be the case is that Taylor was, up til that point, always seen as very ""safe"" and decidedly ""non-sexual"" (which made the slut shaming all the more nonsensical) and the presence of twerking dancers, as well as Taylor in an outfit she never would've been caught dead in prior, was a way of addressing that part of her image as gone now (or on the way out). Specifically [the part here](https://youtu.be/nfWlot6h_JM?t=93) where she is literally pointing to her hips and making a shocked expression. This era was all about changing minds and making people see her differently, so those scenes were much more likely to be saying ""bet you never thought you'd see me this way!"" than anything else.
7. **I Wish You Would:** Not a lot of lore around this one except the secret message and I think something Taylor said in a Secret Session suggests it's about Harry. Or is what she hoped he was doing at that point in time (pining for her and driving past her house).
8. **Bad Blood:** Taylor clarified early on that this song was addressing a woman, not a man (again, the ""I'm different now"" outlook, she didn't want to be defined solely by relationships or breakup songs). She explained that, in the past, she never fully knew where she stood with Katy Perry, basically got ""fake friend"" vibes from her. That seemed to be confirmed when Katy hired Red Tour dancers for her own upcoming tour, before the Red Tour was finished. A lot of people expressed confusion as to why this would cause a rift but my general theory is that a tour is so timed and choreographed to perfection, that losing a number of dancers at random could potentially throw timing and set/costuming changes into disarray. Which is perhaps why Taylor view it as a move of deliberate sabotage. Some have also speculated that Katy dating John Mayer around this time might've contributed to the ongoing tension. Despite its success, the song has always been one of Taylor's least popular and most criticised. The music video, featuring dozens of famous women preparing to fight with Taylor against an enemy, was also criticised for playing into ""girl fight"" stereotypes and pitting women against each other. The music video and surrounding hype is probably where a lot of what went down in 2016 began to bubble under the surface.
9. **Wildest Dreams:** Even today, speculation runs wild (ha) about who this song is about, if anyone. Guesses range from Harry, to Alexander Skarsgaard to Matthew Gray Gubler (?). Skarsgaard is a convincing guess considering they'd just starred in The Giver together, he is incredibly tall (and Taylor is tall too, so if she points it out, he must be very tall!), and they filmed in Africa where the music video takes place. There was discourse aimed at this music video too, this time for not featuring any actors of colour despite taking place in Africa (even though it's a Hollywood film crew in the 50s.........). Lyrically, Taylor continues taking her usual stance/the usual assumptions about her and flipping it. No more starry eyed enchantment, she knows they're going to break up at some point. She's not going in thinking ""He might be the one"", she's thinking ""He'll be fun while it lasts"". A year or so before this, no one would've expected her to write this way. The music video features Scott Eastwood, son of iconic actor Clint Eastwood.
10. **How You Get The Girl:** This continues the general storyline of ""Guy who walked out is now back, what should I do"" and Taylor aimed for it to be a step by step manual for men to use!
11. **This Love:** This song was written back in 2012, originally as a poem that she one day ended up turning into a song. The common assumption is she wrote it when she realised she and Harry had a real shot at dating in October 2012, after first meeting in March 2012 then their schedules and other relationships occupied them for most of the year.
12. **I Know Places:** The second Ryan Tedder co-write on the album. This one was written in response to her current life status, being a huge star and having people hounding/stalking her constantly. She was asking herself ""Who would want this?"" and wrote a song expressing to a lover that she does in fact know how to keep things private. Again, this album is all about perception and changing minds. It's interesting (but understandable) how much this theme has come up in her work since. ""Who could leave/who could stay?"" in The Archer, ""Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?"" in Peace and ""Your love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep"" on King of My Heart.
13. **Clean:** I actually believe this song to be a cleverly placed, hidden in plain sight ode to the Red era and specifically a final goodbye to her feelings for Jake. She has completed her transformation, changed all the minds, changed her outlook and her actual look, and now feels like she's finally moved on from that whole time. The assumption is the song would be about Harry because it's on the ""Harry album"" but the date on the [polaroid for the song's recording session](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fjlep1pvshzf41.jpg%3Fwidth%3D640%26crop%3Dsmart%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D9406b50f4a64317827d8752914d3332455323969) shows Feb 9 2014. She was still very much ""on"" with Harry at that point, she would record Style just ten days later. ""10 months older"" as the lyrics suggest, would go back to April 2013, possibly earlier depending on when she began the song. The ""months and months of back and forth"", the ""wine stained dress"",""lost the war"", framing going back to an ex as a type of addiction, never wanting to end up in that type of situation again - it all suggests the Jake dynamic much more than the Harry one.

**Bonus Tracks:**

* **Wonderland:** This is widely accepted to be another song detailing the late 2012 chaos of dating Harry, along the lines of the anxiety/chaos in Out of the Woods.
* **You Are In Love:** Taylor was inspired by Jack's relationship with Lena Dunham because she wanted to write about a deep type of love she believed she hadn't experienced yet. Lena discourse aside, what intrigues me the most is how Taylor was adamant in clarifying she had not been in love like this before.
* **New Romantics:** The fan favourite actually doesn't have any lore behind it! Really the only noteworthy things would be the highlight lyric: ""we show off our different scarlet letters/trust me, mine is better"" - that's basically Blank Space summarised in a single line! And the song eventually becoming the second song on the 1989 Tour setlist, which isn't typical for bonus tracks but goes to show how popular it was.

**Album Cover:**

There's been some talk about the change from the serious, almost anonymous original photo to the bright, happy smiling Taylor's Version. The Lover diaries revealed when Taylor was preparing the album, she did originally choose a smiling photo as the cover. But in a dream, she saw the cover she ended up choosing and immediately changed it when she woke up. She also [mentioned on Tumblr](https://www.pinterest.com.au/pin/184718022200340807/) that the chosen cover was ""all about the mystery"" which really goes in line with everything I've said here about leaving behind all previous assumptions/images/anything remotely recognisable and starting fresh with new ideas and no assumptions. So I think it's a lovely full circle moment that she is now smiling brightly on her version because IMO it means she's left behind the ""run away from yourself/change everything about yourself"" mentality and is fine being herself. I also wonder if the bonus tracks might contextualise the change as well.

**The album's secret message:**

1. ‚ÄúWelcome to New York‚Äù: We begin our story in New York.
2. ‚ÄúBlank Space‚Äù: There once was a girl known by everyone and no one.
3. ‚ÄúStyle‚Äù: Her heart belonged to someone who couldn‚Äôt stay.
4. ‚ÄúOut of the Woods‚Äù: They loved each other recklessly.
5. ‚ÄúAll You Had to Do Was Stay‚Äù: They paid the price.
6. ‚ÄúShake It Off‚Äù: She danced to forget him.
7. ‚ÄúI Wish You Would‚Äù: He drove past her street each night.
8. ‚ÄúBad Blood‚Äù: She made friends and enemies.
9. ‚ÄúWildest Dreams‚Äù: He only saw her in his dreams.
10. ‚ÄúHow You Get the Girl‚Äù: Then one day he came back.
11. ‚ÄúThis Love‚Äù: Timing is a funny thing.
12. ‚ÄúI Know Places‚Äù: And everyone was watching.
13. ‚ÄúClean‚Äù: She lost him but she found herself and somehow that was everything.

The final line can be seen at the start and end of the Out of the Woods music video, and was also shown on the big screens at the end of the 1989 Tour.

I am a public librarian and since Taylor Swift is so popular right now, a lot of public libraries have been running ‚Äúeras‚Äù events. With 1989 TV coming out recently (probably tied for my favorite album with Lover,) I thought it would be the perfect opportunity to host one!! I‚Äôm super excited!! 

I have a lot of ideas already but I want to represent all of the eras with a craft or activity to do. 

This list I‚Äôve attached isn‚Äôt the most accurate - I have something for debut, Fearless, and Midnights‚Ä¶ however, I don‚Äôt have a craft for my favorite, Lover, or Speak Now! I was thinking I could do snow globes with purple glitter to rep Speak Now - maybe even a ‚Äúback to December‚Äù tie in? But I would welcome any craft ideas or activities you‚Äôve heard of or have even done during a Taylor swift event you‚Äôve attended or hosted. I‚Äôve also included the event flyer just for reference of what it‚Äôs supposed to be.

2758,"Cool With You is exactly what I imagined their new and improved sound would be. The UK garage, the ""Ditto-esque"" visuals, the singing; this is everything I imagined NewJeans would do. 
When I heard Hyein's voice, it reminded me that NewJeans doesn't miss. Every song is a hit. 
Them doing the ""UK"" sound was SUCH A GOOD CHOICE, because it's soft but yet powerful, it's calm yet it hits like a tidal wave. 
This album, so far, is showing why NewJeans is the future of Kpop, and maybe the future of music in general. 
Their music can be loved, not just by Koreans, but by people in other countries. 
Love is universal, and they really know how to use it as a tool for their music.

15461,"**My new favorite activity has been matching up Taylor Swift music videos with songs from albums that I think partially inspired that era.** 

# Through some trial and error, I have found some that match up pretty much perfectly.

**For all of these, you will want to play the song on your phone using Spotify (or another music platform) and watch the music video (muted) on a computer or TV.**

Taylor described being inspired by Paul McCartney and the Beatles while writing *Lover*. I also found [quite a few Easter eggs](https://www.reddit.com/r/GaylorSwift/comments/104i1ct/allusions_to_other_musicians_work_in_the_lover/) alluding to the Beatles in the Lover house and she had a *Lover* clothing collab with Stella McCartney. **So, I figured the Beatles were a good place to start. They even have a compilation album titled** ***Love.***

# Songs that match up with the music videos from Lover:

**Strawberry Fields Forever/Lover:** Use the version of ""Strawberry Fields"" from *Magical Mystery Tour.* Start both songs at the same time (with the ""Lover"" mv muted). It is going to seem like ""Strawberry Fields"" ends before ""Lover"" but ***keep going because it picks back up at the perfect time!***

* **I highly recommend that you at least try this one.** *The male lead even hangs up the cat portrait during the lyric ‚ÄúAnd nothing to get hung about‚Äù.* Most of these were probably not on purpose. Except for this first one. ***I actually feel quite confident that this was not a fluke.***
* *‚ÄúLiving is easy with eyes closed, misunderstanding all you see.‚Äù, ""Let me take you down 'cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields, nothing is real.""*

**All You Need is Love/Me!:** Start ‚ÄúAll You Need is Love‚Äù right when Taylor slams the door after the argument (0:46). ***This one is so beautiful together!*** (If you are one of the people who think ""Me!"" is too cringe/camp, you might even like it more after watching it this way.)

* *‚ÄúHey, kids! Spelling is fun!‚Äù*

**‚ÄúCome Together‚Äù/‚ÄùCalm Down‚Äù:** Start them at the same time and it matches up all the way through to the end of ‚ÄúCome Together‚Äù. The version on The Beatles *Love* is a medley and a bit of ‚ÄúDear Prudence‚Äù will begin to play after the ""Calm Down"" video ends.

* *‚ÄúCome together, right now‚Ä¶over me.‚Äù*

https://preview.redd.it/lx2ah0a8sbfa1.png?width=1204&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=291acb4299fb0cd46e11080f99a9329f71f04d3f

I had a bit more trouble matching up a song by the Beatles with ‚ÄúThe Man‚Äù, I thought maybe it would be ‚ÄúI am the Walrus‚Äù but it didn‚Äôt quite fit. Then, I thought about the album titles on *the wall*‚Ä¶

https://preview.redd.it/x6jep32bsbfa1.png?width=689&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4745d6174d8f3b235bccaa829496d23d5495adea

**Another Brick in the Wall Pt.2/ The Man:** It works so well. **‚ÄúThe Man‚Äù even pees on the wall at the perfect time.** *(Pink Floyd‚Äôs music basically inspired this kind of thing.)* The fade out/dialogue (‚ÄúWrong! Do it again!‚Äù) begins when the scene cuts and the actor walks over to Director Taylor.

# Folklore/Evermore: I have to admit that I only tried one song because I felt like the Lover house provided a pretty good clue‚Ä¶

**Stairway to Heaven/Cardigan+Willow:** Start ""Cardigan"" and ""Stairway"" at the same time. *Pause ""Stairway"" at 4:13* (about the time the last line of credits rolls onto the screen). *Play ""Willow"" and ""Stairway to Heaven""* (from 4:13) at the same time. **This song goes so well with the folklorian world Taylor created for these videos and the ending is** ***glorious!***

* Fun Fact: Led Zeppelin actually have a song titled ""The Battle of Evermore"", which features the mandolin!

# Since the Midnights era is about vinyl records and 70s vibes, I stuck with Pink Floyd:

**Have a Cigar/Anti-Hero:** Start both songs at the same time. There are many actions that sink up throughout. ‚ÄúHave a Cigar‚Äù is basically a critique of the music industry and record labels/corporations.

* *‚ÄúWe're just knocked out, we heard about the sell-out. You gotta get an album out, you owe it to the people. We're so happy we can hardly count. Everybody else is just green, have you seen the chart? It's a hell of a start,* ***it could be made into a monster*** *if we all pull together as a team‚Äù*

**Shine on You Crazy Diamond (pts. 6-9)/Bejeweled+Lavender Haze:** Start ‚ÄúSOYCD‚Äù and ‚ÄúBejeweled‚Äù at the same time. You are going to have to push through at the beginning because the first part is a bit boring **but I promise that it will continue to line up and it gets more exciting**. *Pause ""SOYCD"" at 5:40.* Play ‚ÄúLavender Haze‚Äù and ‚ÄúSOYCD‚Äù (from 5:40) at the same time. ‚ÄúLavender Haze‚Äù will end at the same time as part 8 (Part 9 will still be left).

* *""Nobody knows where you are, how near or how far. Shine on you crazy diamond.""*

As I mentioned, I‚Äôm not really under the impression that this was done on purpose *(except maybe for Lover because that one is too good).* Any separate video and song will have some moments of synchronicity, especially if they have similar BPMs. *(‚ÄúI‚Äôm Coming Out‚Äù by Diana Ross is actually a very fun one to play with the ‚ÄúCalm Down‚Äù mv).*

**However, it‚Äôs a unique and enjoyable way to appreciate and compare art! I'm looking forward to hearing if anyone else tries them out!**

UPDATED: To add that the music videos for ""Delicate"" and ""Iguana Bird"" by Pete Yorn and Scarlett Johansson are such a wonderful sync-up. If you play the ""Iguana Bird"" music video 3 seconds into the video for ""Delicate"" (with ""Delicate"" muted), it feels like two different sides of the same story. So cool!

SECOND AND FINAL UPDATE: After a bit of reworking, I created a [new post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GaylorSwift/comments/10r9cs4/every_music_video_from_lover_perfectly_syncs_up/) with syncs that work EVEN BETTER than these ones.

Apple Music description:

> ‚ÄúReal life is a funny thing, you know,‚Äù Taylor Swift wrote in the liner notes of 2010‚Äôs Speak Now, her third album and the third she‚Äôs rerecorded as part of a sweeping effort to regain her master tapes. ‚ÄúThere is a time for silence. There is a time for waiting your turn. But if you know how you feel, and you so clearly know what you need to say, you‚Äôll know it.‚Äù

> Swift was in her early twenties when she wrote Speak Now, still finding her voice as an artist and as an adult. But she‚Äôs faithful to her originals here‚Äîall of them written on her own, on tour, without co-writers‚Äîand faithful to a much younger version of herself. She pays tribute to early influences like Fall Out Boy and Paramore‚Äôs Hayley Williams, teaming up with them on the reimagined ‚Äúfrom the vault‚Äù tracks ‚ÄúElectric Touch‚Äù and ‚ÄúCastles Crumbling,‚Äù respectively. And though she swaps Nashville producer Nathan Chapman for more recent collaborators Jack Antonoff and Aaron Dessner, the arrangements are still warm and clear‚Äîminus a coat of varnish or two‚Äîwith an eye towards the sort of all-encompassing pop she‚Äôd inevitably, wholeheartedly embrace. We all know what came next for Swift with 2012‚Äôs Red, but, looking back, you can easily see and hear what‚Äôs on the horizon in these songs. 

> The grace of Speak Now is in how it makes simple work out of feelings that are anything but. Swift is vulnerable here, but she‚Äôs also self-empowered (‚ÄúMean‚Äù). She‚Äôs innocent, but knows when to take responsibility (‚ÄúDear John‚Äù). She‚Äôs wise enough to regret her mistakes (‚ÄúBack to December‚Äù), but not too jaded see the best in people (‚ÄúInnocent‚Äù). Does she want to grow up? Yes, if that means more agency and independence (‚ÄúSpeak Now‚Äù). But when you‚Äôre all alone in that new apartment, you still might cry‚Äînot just for the childhood home you left, but for the knowledge that you can never go back (‚ÄúNever Grow Up‚Äù).

> The sound is big, but the details are extremely specific‚Äîat one point, Swift says her rival thinks she‚Äôs crazy because Swift likes to rhyme her name with things (pop-punk blowout ‚ÄúBetter Than Revenge‚Äù). It‚Äôs that balance‚Äîthe universal and the specific, the accessible and the obscure‚Äîthat not only sets Swift apart from most contemporary pop songwriters, but makes her a guide for anyone trying to sort out the impossible avalanche of feelings early adulthood brings.

> Not that you have to be a teenager to resonate with her. If anything, what makes Swift special is her hunch that everyone has had their turn at the heartache she writes about, whether they‚Äôre ready to admit it or not. In her liner notes for Fearless, she described the power of believing in Prince Charmings and happily-ever-afters. On Speak Now, most of the Prince Charmings turn out to be duds, and the real happily-ever-after is the wisdom and resilience you find in falling for them anyway.",https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/14svux1/taylor_swift_speak_now_taylors_version/,Taylor Swift - Speak Now (Taylor's Version),popheads,t3_14svux1,/r/popheads/comments/14svux1/taylor_swift_speak_now_taylors_version/,2023-07-07 03:59:59,Taylor Swift

At the risk of sounding like an overbearing parent, your mods ask that you PLEASE use your own discretion when scheduling a meetup. Vegas is a very busy city with lots of wild characters. Tips to stay safe:

1. Meet in a public place.
2. Do not give out your hotel or room number.
3. Be cautious of who you add on some social media. Some social media (like Snapchat's Snapmap) can share your location to friends.
4. Always keep your drink(s) in your line-of-sight and don't take drinks (or anything else-- it's Vegas after all) from someone you just met, unless you see them get it from the bar.

1. No covers of Taylor's songs from other artists.
2. All genres/artists are welcome, as long as they are AT LEAST relatively known. No obscures, please.
3. The songs you are suggesting must fit somehow the theme or vibe of the Taylor song. Track titles don't matter.

We had a backyard viewing of the Reputation Tour on a large screen.  There were decorations, people made signs, themed cake, lights, bubble machine, homemade remote controlled confetti cannons (red for the first cue, multi-colored to match the Shake it Off confetti), a polaroid photo booth, confetti blower (leaf blower with attachment), colored smoke balls for Getaway Car intro, light up foam sticks, glow bracelets, etc.  I had an absolute blast planning and executing the party, and she loved it.  I watched the Rep movie nightly for several months trying to make it as enjoyable as I could for my daughter and ran around like a crazy person with a cue sheet during the party.

5373,"I think Taylor fleeced everyone here and she will continue to allow narratives to exist that make her money. Everyone in this sub got tricked because she is nothing but a capitalist who wants money at all costs.

That‚Äôs why she didn‚Äôt shut this shit down sooner‚Ä¶she wanted more people to buy shit. She‚Äôs always been this way. You see it in the way she‚Äôs desperate for an EGOT, which she isn‚Äôt getting. She so badly wants to be the center at attention ALWAYS. She never lets shit go and I believe she knowingly went along with the Gaylor shit so that the LGBTQIA+ world would spend more money on her.

I‚Äôve been done for a while. Just look at how she churns out a ‚Äúnew special release version‚Äù of some shit every other day. She‚Äôs milking her fans dry.

Today, we are ranking track that start with **the letter L**.

Note: For this section, I've decided that any song that starts with the word ""the"" will be treated as if ""the"" is not there. Taylor has a LOT of songs that start with ""T"" so this will help the spread a little. 

* Check the comments section for past polls, they stay open.
* Place your highest ranking at the top, and your lowest at the bottom.
* You can rank based off of which are your own personal favorites, or which tracks you consider to be objectively ""best"". Whatever you prefer.
* Results are available **immediately after voting.** You can view results at any time.
* Feel free to discuss in the comments, but be nice! There are no wrong answers here.

It hasn‚Äôt even been a month since Taylor announced Speak Now (Taylor‚Äôs Version), and we don‚Äôt have any information about it beyond the number of tracks it has and the fact that it‚Äôs 100% self-written.

I‚Äôve already felt like Speak Now is living in the shadow of Midnights with 4 new songs and a music video coming out after it‚Äôs announced. I think announcing and releasing 1989 before and/or immediately after Speak Now would be doing a disservice to an album Taylor worked so hard on. Fearless and Red both got there time to shine (yes Red was announced soon after Fearless, but there was such a long time between announcement and release that fearless still had its time in the spotlight).

DISCLAIMER: This is all just for fun, I love Taylor, Travis seems like a great dude, this is nothing but speculation to satisfy my hyperfixation with Gaylor! Nothing I say is me pushing a narrative about two peoples sexualities, it‚Äôs JUST. FOR. FUN. We‚Äôre all here for the same reason, please keep rude/negative comments to yourself. 

I copied all of this from texts I sent my fianc√©e, so please be aware that‚Äôs who this was voiced to in case anything comes off weird to say to the people of Reddit üòÇ I also made an Olivia Rodrigo reference to my fianc√©e, please be aware we both really love Taylor and Olivia, we don‚Äôt need anyone yelling at us about that whole thing. At the end of the day, these are celebrities who we can love whether any of their issues with each other are true or not. Now that all of that‚Äôs said, TO THE THEORY!! 


Facts: 

1. I‚Äôve seen a couple of old blind items implying he‚Äôs gay but they say that about everyone lol! I absolutely believe there are soooooo many closeted gay people, but blinds are like Wikipedia. Anyone can write what they want, some people think calling others gay can hurt their career so you have to weed through those. But I can believe most of these. Anyway, I‚Äôm not here to say Travis is gay, I‚Äôm just saying I saw some implication blind items from a year or so ago with his old gf. BUT I am here to say I read an article that implied he was bi and I‚Äôm more prone to believe that one‚Äôs accurate. And I think the same about Taylor. Just a disclaimer in case it wasn‚Äôt clear

2. I saw a random article on my Google suggested that he had signed with the CAA.

3. I have no idea what the CAA is, I looked it up. Creative Arts Alliance. Oh WOW just read this so adding it in, but the cochairman is from New Iberia and he‚Äôs‚Ä¶. Wait for it‚Ä¶. Gay. So this proves my theory more üòÇüòÇ So the CAA is obv an arts organization that allies all the arts and artists together to help everyone‚Äôs career. I guess like a union? Anyway, blind items about the CAA that are unrelated to my research now talk a lot about how celebs ‚Äúbeard shop‚Äù the CAA to help everyone‚Äôs careers and keep them in the closet and looking straight for the mainstream. Who do we know loves to help further careers? Unless your Olivia Rodrigo üòÇ Mrs. Swift. She‚Äôs IMO bi, and needs to keep that hidden as we theorize. And there‚Äôs 00000000 doubt in my mind that she would look for a man who needs to look 100% straight for his career so it‚Äôs not ruined. Likeeee a conservative state football player who is rising in the game AND is trying to get into tv/film. He‚Äôs had a couple of shows that have flopped and he‚Äôs said that himself. So who better to pair him with than America‚Äôs princess to help him get some recognition???? And they know us Swifties are nosey as hell and love a good parasocial relationship, I say that in the best way üòÇ So who better to use to get that man‚Äôs name out to all kinds of different people!


Observations:

1. The whole fucking world is going crazy over them. EVERYONE. They know anyone Taylor is around will blow uppppp. And the NFL sure seemed to get on this relationship QUICK. Even changed their bios to something Taylor related.  And that‚Äôs not really their thing to be in such drama. Yes it‚Äôs Taylor, but I‚Äôm js everything happened very quickly. 

2. Speaking of, she was seen wearing an unreleased (according to the website) a RED NEW ERA CHIEFS WINDBREAKER. It‚Äôs unreleased, she has it? She‚Äôs Taylor, he‚Äôs Travis, ofc it makes sense he could have access to it. But you‚Äôre telling me they‚Äôre not even official yet and there‚Äôs a whole ass windbreaker already being pushed that‚Äôs called NEW ERA???????????? Now what?????? Tell me that‚Äôs not weird. And everyone‚Äôs already talking about buying them, you know they‚Äôre gonna fucking fly like‚Ä¶ the wind üòè 

3. Travis signed with the CAA it looks like back in Mayish? Theyve struggled with getting Travis known outside of the football world and now he‚Äôs been tied to Taylor, so he‚Äôs ofc gonna be WORLDWIDE now. And those bi rumors that we‚Äôre going around can be squashed down so the conservative football fans don‚Äôt get ahold of them. We know how well that would go. Hmm funny al this comes right around the time they‚Äôre trying to release another movie of the Kelce boys that they‚Äôre having a hard time promoting ü§î 

4. He was wearing that 1989 inspired outfit‚Ä¶. But they supposedly hadnt even met yet?? Make it make sense.

Would‚Äôve, Could‚Äôve, Should‚Äôve and Holy Ground are the Wednesday and Enid of Taylor‚Äôs catalog.

Guardian readers share their experience of the box-office topping three-hour extravaganza, from screaming along to All Too Well to having a brief nap


‚ÄòI wasn‚Äôt looking forward to it ‚Äì but it was wholesome and sweet‚Äô
I took my child, who is a fan, and wasn‚Äôt particularly looking forward to it ‚Äì mainly because it was so long. That said, I enjoyed the campy outfit changes, ambitious staging and marvelled at Swift‚Äôs stamina. My favourite part of the show was during the mystical Folklore section, when the tweenage Swifties standing at the front grabbed each others‚Äô hands and formed a circle, slowly dancing round and round. It was all very wholesome and sweet. Melanie Seddon, West Sussex

‚ÄòA perfect summary of Taylor‚Äôs career across genres‚Äô
It really feels like you‚Äôre at the concert, thanks to cinemas waiving the rules against singing and dancing and the enthusiasm of the audience. I was surprised at how overwhelmed I was to be in a cinema full of people who love Taylor as much as I do. Swifties have in-jokes that the whole crowd says or sings, which they did throughout the film perfectly in sync. As a lifelong fan, there‚Äôs a sense of nostalgia and even pride as you watch her work through the decades of her discography. A highlight was Illicit Affairs ‚Äì it‚Äôs completely different to the studio version and she just sings the bridge. It shows her vocal talent but also a depth of emotion. Everyone was standing singing along for that small bit ‚Äì it‚Äôs definitely a fan favourite. Arabella, 25, London

‚ÄòWe screamed every word to All Too Well‚Äô
I went with pals who I used to work in a record shop with. Whenever a Taylor Swift album came out, it would make the day fly by and we would play it over and over. The concert film was a blend of hits and deep cuts for the fans. We stood, we sang and even though our showing wasn‚Äôt overly busy, we had a whale of a time. A group of young girls next to us were having fun, but considering they were the target market, didn‚Äôt seem to know some of the non-singles ‚Äì unlike the four 30-year-old indie rock fans in the corner, screaming every word to All Too Well (the 10-minute version). The strongest moments seemed to be when Taylor paused to let the crowd sing along. The closeups on her face at those points were those of a human being in the midst of it all ‚Äì it‚Äôs easy to forget she‚Äôs a person too. As concert films go, it was one of the more epic, but would it change a non-fan‚Äôs opinion of her? Probably not. It‚Äôs the strength of the fandom, us Swifties, that made the film what it was and Taylor would probably agree. Matthew, 30, London

‚ÄòI nodded off‚Äô
I‚Äôm not a Swiftie, but the recording and transitions were done well and she put on a hell of a show. I did also nod off at one point. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm not a big concert person, but I don‚Äôt understand people paying through the nose to attend such an experience live. $20 a ticket was acceptable to me for a night out, though, and my wife enjoyed it. It was a savvy move by Swift‚Äôs promoters to get this into theaters so quickly when there was such demand. I‚Äôve certainly paid more for less entertaining shows. Anonymous, 47, Chicago, IL

‚ÄòThe show is bitty, but full of great moments‚Äô
Maybe Taylor-mania hasn‚Äôt quite reached every corner of the planet. I had the whole auditorium to myself to watch the 11.15pm opening night screening at Vue cinema in Birkenhead. It was great for me, sat in the middle of the back row. The show is rather bitty by its nature and doesn‚Äôt have the flow or staging aesthetic of the 1989 or Reputation tour films. It is full of great moments, though. The standout was an utterly compelling performance of All Too Well. She sings with complete conviction; all of the myriad sets and the sheer scale of the concert evaporate. You are confronted by 10 minutes of emotional clarity and honesty, the camera almost exclusively on her face. The stage set for the Evermore songs was also vivid and memorable. So was the wild fun and colour of the concert closer Karma, where everyone on the stage can let loose a little. I‚Äôll be keeping an eye out for resale tickets so I can see the show live at Anfield next year, if the prices ever become accessible. John Keogh, Birkenhead

‚ÄòA surreal cinema experience‚Äô
I bought tickets with my friend who I‚Äôm going to the concert with next year. We didn‚Äôt buy into the encouragement to dress up or hand out friendship bracelets ‚Äì which we‚Äôll save for the actual concert. There was an announcement at the start that we could sing, dance and be as loud as we wanted. It was impossible not to get into the swing of it, and it turned out to be emotional. Taylor Swift was entwined into many of our upbringings for the past 15 years, which made this a unique experience. The film was almost three hours, but it flew by. When Tolerate It started some people were crying singing along; each song meant something different to different people, so with every transition someone else would be standing up. We had a family ‚Äì a mum, dad and older daughter in front of us ‚Äì all holding hands for some of her older songs from the Fearless album. Sophie, 25, London

You are swept along‚Äô
I saw this at the Cineworld Imax in Leicester Square with my 15-year-old son. I thought the film was magnificent. Although this concert does not overtly tell a story, there is a gorgeous flow of mood, rhythm and theme with no jarring moments. Despite the film‚Äôs length, you are swept along. Crucially, the live version of some songs transforms them into something new ‚Äì Champagne Problems reveals new glories here, and the rendition of August is so stunning it feels like it was designed to be a centrepiece. Like many concert films, it probably will not fare well on the small screen, but at the cinema it is tremendous.

My interpretation of this quote is that she's discussing the Rep. **stage** during the Eras tour? Not that she is describing the original album, but the ""moment"" she's referring to is the Rep. stage & performance during this tour? 

Curious to hear other interpretations since I've seen so many people discussing her sorta rewriting history of what the the ablum is, but I don't see that at all here. 

From the article: 

[She tells me about revisiting Reputation, which is perhaps the most charged era in the tour. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a goth-punk moment of female rage at being gaslit by an entire social structure,‚Äù she says, laughing. ‚ÄúI think a lot of people see it and they‚Äôre just like, Sick snakes and strobe lights.‚Äù] 

Follow-up discussion - she's obviously switched the focus and general vibe of various Taylor's Versions, ex: Red to a sad girl autumn album & 1989 to a summsd beachy album. What are your various thoughts on what we can expect with Reputation? Do you think she'll lean into this feminist rage vibe (which I'm absolutely here for)?",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/18dwqv3/gothpunk_moment_of_female_rage/,"""Goth-punk moment of female rage.""",TaylorSwift,t3_18dwqv3,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/18dwqv3/gothpunk_moment_of_female_rage/,2023-12-08 21:08:41,Taylor Swift

7449,"I learned a lot from this group, and I am so grateful that I was able to get a ticket with all the info I learned from this group. Just want to share my experience and hopefully can help someone going for the last weekend. 


Thursday
             
I reached Vegas on Thursday, after checking into the hotel(Harrah's-about 5 min walk from the colosseum) I went to the box office at around 7:20, was told it was closed at 7:10. But later I was told by Mike(who works at box office no tickets were released on Thursday)

Friday
            
I went there at around 6:30 am, and brought my laptop and everything so I could do some work while inline. There were no lines but some people were sitting at the slot machine in front of the box office. Talked to them and learned we all trying to get tickets for Friday. I was the 5th person that reached there. They also told me that the reason they didn't form a line was because at 6am the security told them they can't stand in line until 9 am. So we all just sat at the slot machines. At 9 am we all stand in the line based on how early we reached box office and as the time get closer to 12pm, the line was getting bigger. I think at 12 there were 20-25 ppl in line already. When they open, they will announce no tickets today and ask everyone to not stand in line(cause they are selling tickets to other shows as well).But they will also tell ppl to feel free to come back and ask them. This is super important cause you should really be interacting with them and let them see you hanging around, so when a ticket comes out, they will be able to identify you. 

I left for the boutique at 12:30 and then left for lunch, went back, took a shower and come back at around 3:30. When I came back only 4 ppl were hanging around and they told me someone got their tickets before I came. 

I was offered a ticket at around 4 pm. They had 2 tickets at section 204 row C for $865(lodge seats with couches) and the person standing in line behind me and I shared the 2 tickets together. Also a side note, if you got a seat in the lodge section, you don't need to wait in line to get your drinks, a server will come to you at the beginning and throughout the show to take your orders. 


Saturday 
            
Since I didn't plan anything for Vegas and was giving myself two days to try to get a ticket. After the show, on Saturday I was pretty free. Was hanging around, went to the boutique couple more times and got the merch that was originally out of my size. Thinking of getting another ticket but didn't really put much effort in it. Was able to talk to Mike again and he said Friday they had 11 tickets in total and Saturday they had 8 by the time I last talked to him(5 pm). I didn't end up getting a ticket on Saturday and I saw there were ppl waiting until the last minute. 

The conclusions from my experience:

1. Go early, but not too early because your position in line is not directly related to how likely you will get a ticket. 

2. Talk to ppl around you, and make friends, I got lucky that I left for lunch and came back and still got a ticket. I talked to a lot of ppl in the line and we kinda all know each other. I didn't ask them to hold me a place, but I think it's definitely helpful(I shared a pair tickets with someone I met in the morning).

3. be consistent, don't feel shy to bother them, talk to them, ask them questions,s and let them know your dedication(lol sounds crazy but true, they will notice and acknowledge your effort)

4. go to the boutique in the afternoon or after the show start, they will restock during that time

5. Go on Friday if possible

6. Be nice to everyone, there was a couple who came at 8am trying to claim they were the first in line and had an argument with the rest of the group(the guy was calling all of us scalpers). I saw them on Saturday waiting again, not sure if they got tickets 

7. trivia questions can be hard, mine as what's Adele's bf's job(lol I only know it's some kind of manager) but if you are nice to them they will be nice to you as well 

8. Be early to the show, if your hotel is far, bring your outfit with you, change in the bathroom, and check your luggage at Ceasars",https://www.reddit.com/r/adele/comments/11y520c/my_experience_of_box_office_fri_317/,My experience of box office Fri 3/17,adele,t3_11y520c,/r/adele/comments/11y520c/my_experience_of_box_office_fri_317/,2023-03-22 03:14:57,Adele

29380,"*He was tryna skip rocks on the ocean*


Skipping rocks is beautiful. When tossed at a certain angle, the rock pushes the water down and bounces up, creating a ripple. It‚Äôs best done on lakes and calm rivers. Oceans are hard to skip rocks on, it can be done when the waters are flat, but waves are typically present. Taylor says that Bobby tried to skip rocks on the ocean, calling attention to his playfulness and optimism. He dreams impossible things, like a rock skipping on wavy waters, and bigger dreams.

17686,"This is for the rerecording of Debut-Red (since Jack is one of OG producers for 1989 and rep so it would makes sense for him to do some vault songs for these two albums obviously)

I always wondered ever since she released Fearless TV and now after hearing Forever Winter demo.

I think most of vault songs already have a demo version and they would've turned out better if she just asked Christopher Rowe to copy the demo production like he does for the standard tracks. I don't get why she wants to change the production. we are excited for these vault songs not just as some random new Taylor songs but because we are happy to be getting a few songs with the same sound and vibes of our favourite albums. (which fans of most artists don't get to experience)

I don't want to be overly negative but I was so excited for Speak Now TV before but now I don't know. Cause I was excited for the possibility of songs like Haunted, TSOU, Back To December etc. Songs with real drums, electric guitars, strings, violins etc and it just won't be the same when she makes them with Jack and they sound like Babe tv or Don't you. (There's nothing wrong with them they're good songs , just have different production like she put a synth pop song on Fearless?! I still don't get it) 

I know ultimately Taylor decides how they will sound but I feel like she just gives Jack too much freedom and let's him do his thing for the most part and he makes them sound more pop instead of country/pop country. I just wish she worked with country producers for the vault songs of her first 4 albums. They had a certain charm that Jack can't recreate üíî

Anyway what do you guys think?


Edit: by the way I'm not talking about her bringing back the original producer Nathan Chapman. I know that's probably not possible cause he's signed to Big Machine Records.

I am wanting to do a Taylor event the week before the closest concert to our campus (mostly to hype myself up lol). I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôd do Taylor karaoke, make her chai cookies, and have friendship bracelet making supplies available. We have the karaoke machine and everything else would be very affordable, and I won‚Äôt have a big budget that month (May/June) because most residents will already be gone. Is this lame?

23708,"Hi folks! This is going to be a long one... but I wanted to at least open a discussion on ""Thug Story."" I included sections to summarize what it is, why it is important, and some of my thoughts on the matter. Looking forward (kind of, kind of concerned) to reading your thoughts.

What is ""Thug Story"":

* June 16, 2009
   * Taylor Swift and T-Pain debut ""Thug Story"" the 2009 CMT Music Awards as a parody of ""Love Story."" The video features a cameo from Andrea Swift. ([Source](https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-thug-story-lyrics) w/ Lyrics).
   * Taylor Swift wins *Video of the Year* and *Female Video of the Year* for ""Love Story"" ([Source](http://www.cmtpress.com/program/2009-cmt-music-awards/page/nominees-recipients/)).
* November 14, 2017
   * In an interview with Desus & Mero: T-Pain, reflecting on collaborating with Swift, notes """"I just realized I only collaborated with her to make fun of hip-hop""  (Time: 15:39).

Why this discussion is important:

* ""Thug Story"" is often **used as an indicator of tenure**, such as in previous posts, to signal the length or depth of the user's time as a fan.
* With the **Eras Tour and rerecording** comes renewed interest in Taylor Swift's complete catalogue and past projects.
* **Taylor Swift has referenced ""Thug Story"" during the Eras Tour**, mouthing ""You don't wanna fight me"" in her Cincinnati, OH show outside of her regular programming.

My thoughts:

First and foremost, this is a criticism of the fanbase's reaction and use of ""Thug Story."" After all, I don't know or speak for Taylor personally, have not seen much discussion on her behalf, and am doubtful she would ever read this. However, how the fanbase contextualizes and discusses her body of work creates precedence for how the many current and future viewers pass down her artwork and understand what is acceptable and what is not.

Just like I don't foresee her rerecording her 2013 SNL Monologue, I don't actually foresee her rerecording ""Thug Story."" However, I am uncomfortable by how many fans are willing to tolerate, celebrate, memorize, and memorialize ""Thug Story"" by sharing the videos, begging for a rerecording, dressing up as ""Thug Story"" caricatures, or using screenshots of her videos across platforms as punchlines.

Watching ""Thug Story,"" the punchline is drawn from comparing the stereotypes of ""thugs"" or ""gangsters"" to how the public imagined the then-country-music-star Taylor Swift. The song plays on humor from irony and preconceptions - just as you would not stereotype a ""thug"" ""baking cookies at night,"" you would also not likely stereotype America's sweetheart in a club or with a firearm, or rapping.

As in the Desus & Mero interview with T-Pain, just as the term hip-hop and ""urban"" are often used to denote black people, [the word ""thug"" has its own racially charged history](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7179289) as a ""pejorative term describing young, black men who are considered criminals."" Part of the ""Thug Story"" punchline is Taylor Swift being white herself, being a country-music star, and placing herself in a position of ""baking cookies"" and ""\[knitting\] sweaters."" This is in stark comparison and in then-mockery to the hip-hop and the stereotype of the ""thug"" - the young, black man ""out clubbing"" with a firearm, diamond grills, and a demeanor you don't want to fight.

As other critics online such as wonderfuckedinthehead and brookeg28 on TikTok have noted, stereotypes used against the black community are perpetrated by ""Thug Story."" The caricature itself depicts a [much larger harm on black lives and livelihoods](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/stereotypes-harm-black-lives-and-livelihoods-but-research-suggests-ways-to-improve-things/) that is only echoed by current fans dressing in caricature or poking fun at the idea of being a ""thug."" I do not admit to never finding amusement in the skit since it was release in 2009, but I find ""Thug Story"" a strange and racist topic for fans to build community around after all this time.

This discussion would be remiss without mentioning *reputation* where she uses elements of R&B and trap to create the album's sound (not to forget ""Don't Blame Me"" with hints of soul), genres popularized and largely voiced by black artists. This is notably in an album that mentions themes of crime (""Getaway Car""), drugs (""Don't Blame Me""), drinking (""Delicate"") - the latter two not being inherently negative.

I use *reputation* as an example because whereas the themes are stereotypes are used in full force against black people, *reputation* is consistently branded as a complex dive into her life, encapsulated into an era. Don't get me wrong - understanding her music and life as multi-dimensional is great, and being able to evolve is a wonderful ability. However, this is the very luxury that is not afforded or granted towards black people - not in ""Thug Story"" and not in any of the ways ""Thug Story"" is celebrated.

I am by no means here to censure any fans or encourage harassment towards anyone. As a fan myself, I believe if you are able to study and dissect the crazy numbers of songs or Easter eggs Taylor Swift puts out there, you can analyze her projects as a subset of an intricate culture rooted in history. As members of a community of fans, it is everybody's responsibility to call out past and present racism, call out unwelcoming behaviors, and educate others on how to be knowledgeable and actionable community members.

Other than the creators I mentioned above, there are many voices out there with similar and different critiques by POC fans and by black fans, and I implore you to listen to them. In order to call ourselves a good community we need to not only be mindful of current community members, but also towards the community we want to build.

Note: I realize this may have the supposed Streisand effect for some, but I also realize the discussion would likely come sooner than later. I also want to note I did not discuss this with any of the creators I mentioned in this post, and am not directing harassment.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/155g0ci/lets_discuss_thug_story/,"Let's Discuss ""Thug Story""",TaylorSwift,t3_155g0ci,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/155g0ci/lets_discuss_thug_story/,2023-07-21 06:50:25,Taylor Swift

I‚Äôve come to the unfortunate realization that the Wonderland pullover I‚Äôve ordered as a Christmas gift for my cousin is expected to ship ‚Äúon or around December 29th.‚Äù I‚Äôd also ordered the 1989 cardigan for myself, which shipped way early on October 31st and is now in Ferndale, MI. Happy to see the cardigan shipping so much earlier than the expected December 15th shipping date ‚Äî but now I‚Äôm worried that the pullover won‚Äôt make it here before Christmas.

Any thoughts on the likelihood of receiving these late-December products before Christmas? Has anyone received 1989 apparel other than the cardigan yet? It seems that the cardigan might be exception for early shipping bc most of the merch lists shipping dates past the holidays.

18576,"My wife went with one of her friends to see Taylor in Arlington this past Friday and she was obviously in absolute awe. But a big part of what she told me of the concert was how nice everyone was. She made friends with people she sat next to. People complimented her outfit. People offered to take pictures/videos on her phone. She even forgot her phone at a merch table and when she went back to find it, it was right where she had left it. 

I tend to be a pretty anxious person, so dropping her off at the concert where there was going to be so many people packed into that stadium, it made me pretty nervous. But she had nothing bad to say about her time. She just had a safe space to dance and sing (and cry, a shocking amount of crying) while seeing her absolute favorite artist. Anyone rude enough could have easily thrown a wet blanket on the night and she was just on cloud nine when she got out. 

So, from the bottom of my heart, thank you for being a good fandom. Keep up the good work.

3818,"We all know the line ""family that I chose now that I see your brother as my brother"" and how confident Hetlors are that the lyric cements the song peace to be about Joe, because he has brothers, and Karlie only has sisters. However...

Joe has two brothers, so is Taylor calling out that she only has a relationship with one of them? I doubt she'd put that kind of in-law drama into a song forever. 

And then Karlie posts this Instagram photo today, celebrating Derek Blasberg's birthday! Captioned: ""happiest of birthdays to my big brother üíú love you @derekblasberg""

So of course I took to Google and found tons & tons of photos of Karlie with Derek at awards shows and out on the town, especially in 2014 and 2015. Who else was in these photos? Our girlie girl, Miss Taylor Alison Swift of course! The best of these? The selfie of Taylor and Derek posted to Twitter from the 2014 Met gala captioned: ""me & @Taylorswift trying to make @karliekloss jealous"" This has so many implications, but at the bare minimum it shows us that Taylor was introduced to Derek by Karlie. Also of note- Derek is gay.

Interesting too is the use of ""chosen family"" in this same line. We know that the queer community created the concept of a found/chosen family as a way to have accepting community and close bonded family relationships with people who are not blood bound. So why would Taylor use this term specifically in a song about not being able to give her partner peace in life, asking if her love would be enough to overcome the difficulties of being in a private, but publicly scrutinized relationship? Would it be because she wanted to hint at the reason why they would never find true peace together? 

There are lots of other symbols/lyrics in peace that tie to Karlie, and I believe that folklore was Taylor's raw emotional processing of their breakup, put into an escapist storyline where she could wander the folklorian forest but the album is fueled by her emotions (followed by evermore in which she starts to find her joy and closure again as she gets back into writing music and creating, finding her happiness in her craft again). 

What do you think? Karlie's Instagram and socials have been flooded with Kaylors lately and she knows we're watching. The decision to post Derek with this caption right now... Seems sus to me!! (She posted similarly for Derek's birthday in 2021, with a brother caption, but not 2022 or 2019. Derek's birthday being in April, folklore came out in June 2020, so 2021 was the first year after the song was released tha Karlie could've posted his birthday post.)

What other lyrics in peace do you think are obviously about Kaylor's breakup?",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/12w99t7,"Karlie's ""brother"" & peace",Gaylor_Swift,t3_12w99t7,/r/Gaylor_Swift/comments/12w99t7/karlies_brother_peace/,2023-04-23 13:47:38,Taylor Swift

11204,"Devastated when the lover ornament sold out so quickly on the US site that i then successfully purchased on the canada website last week. A couple days ago, (again with the devastation of the wonderland blanket being sold out), the canada store restocked the blanket and i ran to buy it, however it would not ship to the US. They locked the US region and lots of other people were complaining about the same thing on here. 

Im moving to another state 12/21 so these drops have been making me anxious knowing how unpredictable the shipping is. 

After i ordered i messaged them saying i put my future address but may have to change my address if it ships sooner. They told me not to worry, the ornaments will ship out starting 12/22.

Then i realized i forgot to add my apartmebt number! So i sent anogher message and got this back: 


""Unfortunately, the address you provided is coming up as invalid in our system.   In order to ship your item, please provide us with an updated address or P.O. box. You can also verify if your address is deliverable with USPS using the link below. Additionally, if the shipping destination you selected at check-out does not return any available shipping rates, or your country is not listed, we do not ship to that country at this time. Our apologies for any inconvenience.""



I dont know if they are putting this becuase they are trying to change my address with the apartment number and it wont let them becuase my country is now locked, but now i am so worried they are going to cancel my order and i will not be buying from resellers. I already had to do that with the lover snowglobe i missed out last tuesday... but there was no way i wasnt going to get that as i am certain there will be no restocks outside of cancelled orders and returns. (AlSO! There was only 13k that were available to buy in the US site! That is INSANELY insane. I mean i know they made more speak now and all too well snowglobes... but seriously only 13k LOVER snowglobes? They could sell 100k! There was only 13k released on the US site for the lover live in paris vinyl as well for reference. Vinyl has never been more popular so extremely odd how they pick these things to be limited.

2229,"It's just absolutely flawless.
The way it sets the tone for the rest of the song, it's pretty iconic.

I know a lot of fans overlook her because of her age, but I honestly believe that Hyein is WAAAAAY more talented than what people think. 

Starting a career in the industry at such a young age, around 8 or 9, she's done MODELING, TV, COMMERCIALS, COMEDY, MUSIC, and she's only 14!

I always tell people, she has what it takes to be a TOP High fashion runway model, being 5'7 at 14, she probably still will grow a couple inches, even if she doesn't grow, her model walk is already A+. 

Her part in Ditto has sooo much emotion, her voice really captures you in. 
Watching the ""behind the scenes"", her voice barely needs any auto tune, like she's great. 

Hopefully she shows us more of her singing during her next comeback! 

I remember when DITTO first came out, and people kept saying the ""Wooo"" is maybe Danielle or Hanni, and all the line distribution videos on YouTube had to remake their videos once they found out it was hyein. 

Like when you hear Ditto, her part is literally the first thing any one listens to. 

I just wanted to take this time, to show some appreciation on how talented our little Maknae really is!

Don't SLEEP ON HYEIN!

She's only 14, imagine her voice at 18-19. 
She'll be unstoppable!

17251," I was cleaning for several hours and I had Would've, Could've, Should've on repeat for hours and I couldn't stop thinking about some references of the past which Taylor had referenced from Red (2012 era). I've seen some people suggest that IKYWT and Treacherous is about Jake Gyllenhaal (some lyrics could still apply), or Harry Styles but Would've, Could've, Should've makes it even **more crystal clear** she's referring to John Mayer. Which got me confused why people think it's about Harry or Jake?:

***

*Some discussion evidence (important pre-context):*

In the I Knew You Were Trouble music video, Taylor has opening dialogue before the track sets and one of her quotes is the following:

&gt; ""I think part of me knew the second I saw him that this would happen. It's not really anything he said or anything he did, **it was the feeling that came along with it** and the crazy thing is I don't know if I'm ever going to feel that way again, **but I don't know if I should.....**"" 

(Heads up, in Dear John she references her mother also telling Taylor she was ""losing her mind"" which also can connect to Would've, Should've, Could've in the same feeling she is describes...) 

&gt;""How could **the devil** be pulling you toward someone who looks so much like an angel when he smiles at you?"" *Maybe he knew that when* **he saw me**

***

Now in Would've, Could've, Should've a lot of these references make there way again: 

&gt; If you would've blinked, then I would've
Looked away at the first glance /

&gt; Ooh, all I used to do was pray
Would've, could've, should've
If you'd never looked my way

In the I Knew You Were Trouble music video, it starts with a look, which she references in the first verse &amp; pre-chorus. The I Knew You Were Trouble secret message is also: ""WHEN YOU SAW ME DANCING"" as he caught Taylor first which she speaks of in Would've, Could've, Should've.


Now the same devil reference comes again in Would've, Could've, Should've where Taylor tends to link this person as very bad by referring them as the devil:

&gt; **And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil**
At nineteen...

Looking back at our IKYWT context quote:

&gt; How could **the devil** be pulling you toward someone who looks so much like an angel...

""The devil"" nickname referring to this certain somebody also pops up again in ""Dear Reader"" 

&gt; ""When you aim at the devil make sure you don't miss""

Which once circles back to Would've, Could've, Should've *again* as she acknowledges ""hitting him where it hurts"" in revenge:

&gt; Living for the thrill of hitting you where it hurts 


***

&gt; *And the God's honest truth is that the pain was heaven*

She once again makes a similar reference in I Knew You Were Trouble (pain = 'the feeling that came along with it' and warning herself she shouldn't be enjoying feeling pain from this relationship which correlates to the 'heaven' feeling in Would've, Should've, Could've... ):

**It was the feeling that came along with it** and the crazy thing is I don't know if I'm ever going to feel that way again, but I don't know if I should.....""

***

Now Treacherous also comes into play in all of this because Treacherous has been stated by Taylor to be the first part of a story and I Knew You Were Trouble the 2nd.

Treacherous has a Mayer reference in the first lines:

&gt; 'Til the gravity's too much
And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands

But once again Taylor also acknowledges how bad this person is (devil, trouble, quicksand) all three tracks notes how she knew he was bad news. Each of these songs constantly have Taylor from the beginning acknowledging they're *bad.*

&gt; But you're quicksand
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I, I, I like it


***

Other than the songs all coming together, more obvious signs:

* Guy in music video is portrayed as a musician, with tattoos, has a smilar look to Mayer with the hat, longer hair, necklace, etc. [example](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/54xffP3-DrQ/maxresdefault.jpg) / [music video](http://images.summitmedia-digital.com/candy/images/articles/lifestyle/entertainment/201302/big/201302-trouble2_cover.jpg)

&gt; ""Flew me to places I've never been"" 

Makes sense to be in context about John, considering Taylor was 19 in this relationship and just starting out her career. John had more accessibility and Taylor at that point obviously hadn't been *everywhere* like she has now. 

&gt; ""I heard you moved on from whispers on the street...""

Is referring to John Mayer beginning to date Katy Perry at the time (as this song was written late 2012) and the ""whispers"" is tabloids and the public talking about them going out. She makes a similar reference about herself in [Would've, Could've, Should've with the tabloids talking about herself and Mayer going out and him seeing her dance](https://www.laineygossip.com/Taylor-Swift-crushing-on-John-Mayer-at-Crossroads-performance-with-Keith-Urban-27jan10/15786)

* &gt; And if you never saved me from boredom (Would've, Could've, Should've)

This gets more acknowledged in I Knew You Were Trouble and Treacherous.

15915,"I think Suburban Legends and Hits Different might be about the same storyline, and here's some reasons why.
 
First but least, they're sonically similar, being fast-paced major songs with a strong sense of momentum. (SL also sounds a lot like Mastermind but that's another discussion) 

Some lyrical parallels - 

Both refer to idolising and admiring the subject intensely.
SL: 'so magnetic it was almost obnoxious'
HD: 'dreams of your hair and your stare'

Both contain the central idea of one-time momentous, special romance that there is no recovery from:
SL: 'you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever'
HD: 'moving on was always easy for me to do, it hits different 'cause it's you'

Both paint a scene of waiting and walking impatiently (maybe in a shared neighbourhood?):
SL: 'Tick tock on the clock, I pace down your block'
HD: 'like waiting for a bus that never shows, you just start walking on'

Both have beach imagery (are the new 1989 beachy visuals related to HD, then?) 
SL: 'waves crash to the shore' 
HD: 'the sun burns my heart and the sand hurts my feelings'

This is where it gets a bit interpretive - the line 'you don't knock anymore' (SL) at face value means the person doesn't visit anymore, but when I first heard it I interpreted it as the person is so familiar they don't NEED to knock - similar to 'I heard your key turn in the door... is it ok, is it you?' (HD) 

Lastly, the theme of fiction/storytelling: 
SL: 'We were born to be suburban legends' 
HD: 'This is why they shouldn't kill off the main guy'

70,"Hi all, I'm hoping someone's had a similar experience or can help shed some light on this for me.

Last night I decided to finally order evermore on Amazon Germany to get (what I hope will be) the opaque green variant of the vinyl. I've been holding off for a while now... so I was happy to get it ordered (despite the shipping cost).

This morning I got a sketchy-looking email from DHL about an order from Amazon, and that I had the option to authorize delivery without signature. I tried researching a bit, then decided to ignore the email.

But then I decided to check my evermore order again, and sure enough, that email specified my order would be shipped via DHL and the tracking numbers matched. So then I decide to look a little bit into DHL.

I've never used them before, so I'm pretty confused about what I should do.

It says my order should be delivered on March 31 (this Friday), which is extremely surprising for me since I barely ordered it yesterday and the confirmation email said April 10 (two weeks from yesterday).

I guess I'm confused about if I should authorize delivery without signature or not. I will most likely not be home that day, and although there is someone that will be, I don't want them to wait around all day for me and I don't yet know if they even could. So I've been leaning towards opting for delivery without signature, but I get anxious a little too easily, and I'm a little nervous about that option.

I'm also wondering if there are going to be any other fees or whatever I will need to pay. I already winced a bit at paying $50 for the vinyl + shipping, so I'd hate to get any messages saying I need to pay for other customs fees or this and that ... I'd also hate for there to be any other issues such as with the delivery itself and I'd be out $50. (Though, I ordered this through Amazon; but I don't know if returns from U.S. to Germany (?) are as ""forgiving"" and flexible as it seems to be for U.S. Amazon.

TLDR: Ordered evermore on vinyl through Amazon Germany, I was not expecting to have the vinyl shipped through DHL (I'd never heard of them before today), I don't know if I should opt out of the signature or not (even though I likely won't be there to sign / have someone sign for me), and I'm a little nervous about any other fees that may come up.

Thank you so much in advance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwiftVinyl/comments/124xv55/located_in_us_ordered_evermore_on_amazon_germany/,"Located in U.S., ordered evermore on Amazon Germany, confused about DHL On Demand Delivery...",TaylorSwiftVinyl,t3_124xv55,/r/TaylorSwiftVinyl/comments/124xv55/located_in_us_ordered_evermore_on_amazon_germany/,2023-03-28 18:33:23,Taylor Swift

For playlist purposes, I just have All of the Girls and Need, and You‚Äôre Losing Me at the end of their respective albums, but for me, both Daylight and Dear Reader are actually the perfect endings to their albums and I almost feel they deserve to remain that way, so I was wondering if anyone had any specific placements for certain songs.

In the case of Fearless and Red TV, I‚Äôve grown used to the fact the Vault Tracks are at the end of the album, but a part of me also feels this means both albums suddenly lack a cohesive ‚Äòalbum closer.‚Äô Technically All Too Well (10 Minute Version) works as an album closer, but feels to grand, and Bye Bye Baby despite its title just doesn‚Äôt say closing track for me.

The cussing feels very much like me in middle school, adding in cuss words for no reason just to seem cool, edgy, and adult. I asked Siri to play this album and it chose the clean version for me. Usually, I get irrationally angry and immediately switch over to the explicit version.

21151,"It doesn‚Äôt need to be said that most swifties understand her incredible artistic abilities and that she truly is up there with the greatest in music.

Yet, whenever she gets compared to Bob Dylan or Joni Mitchell, or just mentioned as a ‚Äúgreat songwriter‚Äù, it‚Äôs met with mysogynistic dismissal of her as ‚Äújust a pop star‚Äù and undermining the importance of writing about a nuanced woman‚Äôs experience. Even excusing away her records and awards because ‚Äúshe just makes music for young girls‚Äù (or other nonsense).

However, I think eventually the way it‚Äôs ‚Äúpopular‚Äù now to dunk on her credibility, the tides will change. I think there will be, in a way, a race for people to say things along the lines of ‚ÄúI always knew she was going to be in the history books‚Äù. 

One side similar-ish example, when Lana‚Äôs Born to Die album was released, Pitchfork rated it super low, and then many years later came back and said ‚Äúoops we were wrong, this had huge cultural impact‚Äù and literally *\*re-rated\** it at much higher. 

**So, do you think the women‚Äôs narrative will ever be accepted as legend status like some of the other biggest names in history?**

So tell us your very most unhinged Swiftie moments and theories. No judgement, just shared fun and unhinged Swiftieness.

I'll go first! (you definitely don't have to read this unless you really want to) 

Unhinged moment- losing it completely to illicit affairs at the Eras Tour Movie. I got out of my seat and ran all the way to the front during august, then hyperventilated once it ended with my friend smacking my back to make me breathe normally. I abused my vocal cords worse than the Don't Blame Me high note and barely looked at the screen the whole time, just screaming at my theater. There were definitely concerned faces in the crowd. One of my biggest regrets is not filming that, I would love to be able to go back to being that feral :))))

Unhinged theory- I'll have you know that my February 16th Reputation Taylor's Version theory is perfectly respectable. But I did this random bit of numerology for it that makes little to no sense. You see, 1989 was Taylor's 5th album, and it's the rerelease before Reputation Taylor's Version. So if you add 5 to 13, it's 18. And you can break down 18 into 2 + 16: 2 for February and 16 for the 16th! And 1989 Taylor's Version is technically Taylor's 14th album, and if you get the 2 from February and add it to 14, it makes 16.

Anyways, I was a third-gen KPOP fan (Blackpink, Twice, Red Velvet: heck, even iKon and DAY6), and usually the first thing I do when I stan a new group is watching all of their variety-show contents. I just love seeing the group dynamics and their individual personalities.

For NJs, it is awesome that they make their own contents on their Youtube channel, as the girls wouldn‚Äôt be as shy compared to when they appeared on other shows, but they are just so many videos to watch, hahaha.

I watched all of their Jeans‚Äô ZINE already as well as their Idol‚Äôs Physical Test episode and New Zips. I‚Äôm also aware of their appearances in NJ in Busan, Yoo Quiz, IU‚Äôs show and Myung Soo‚Äôs show, and I plan to watch all of them next.

5124,"I was reading the Castles Crumbling lyrics and started thinking it potentially could be interpreted in a gaylor way. This is a little unhinged and ü§°, I'm aware. 

So this song has been said to be about your reputation falling and people turning on you. And some have interpreted that to mean the song is about the kanye 2009 vmas thing. Which I suppose is definitely possible, however I think a lot of lines don't really fit that.

Anyways, my unhinged hypothesis is that she's imagining a future where she's come out and it goes really badly and she's abandoned by her now-angry fans. Basically outlining the worst case scenario and her fears about it.

&#x200B;

>*Once, I had an empire in a golden age*  
*I was held up so high, I used to be great*  
*They used to cheer when they saw my face*  
*Now, I fear I have fallen from grace*

Her career was kicking ass in the past and now that she's come out, she's ""fallen from grace"".

&#x200B;

>*And I feel like my castle's crumbling down*  
*And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground*  
*And you don't want to know me*  
*I will just let you down*  
*You don't wanna know me now*

Coming out resulted in her career falling apart and fans leaving her. She imagines that now they don't want to know her and aren't interested in her music now that they know it's queer. 

&#x200B;

>*Once, I was the great hope for a dynasty*

Dynasty could potentially refer to the way she changed country and paved the way for a bunch of new female country artists. Or, conversely, that the country artists before her were the dynasty (dixie chicks, shania) and taylor was reviving it and bringing lots of new young female listeners to country. 

&#x200B;

>*Crowds would hang on my words, and they trusted me*

I think this one is obvious. Interesting that she draws attention to the trust aspect. 

&#x200B;

>*Their faith was strong, but I pushed it too far*

Perhaps she's saying the fans had so much faith and love for her, but it turns out she went farther than that faith extended.

&#x200B;

>*I held that grudge 'til it tore me apart*

Not exactly sure what grudge is being referred to here, but maybe this could be interpreted as her desire to come out -- saying that she wanted it very badly and perhaps she was jealous of other artists that were out. And then in the end she had to come out because it was tearing her apart.

&#x200B;

>*Power went to my head, and I couldn't stop*  
*Ones I loved tried to help, so I ran them off*

Not sure how to interpret these lines. Any ideas?

&#x200B;

>*And here I sit alone, behind walls of regret*  
*Falling down like promises that I never kept*

Now she regrets coming out because of how it turned out. The promises line is hazy to me but one interpretation could be that her ""confessional, authentic songwriting"" that fans have believed is now revealed to not be fully truthful, i.e. hiding behind bearding. Other interpretations?

&#x200B;

>*My foes and friends watch my reign end*  
*I don't know how it could've ended this way*  
*Smoke billows from my ships in the harbor*  
*People look at me like I'm a monster*  
*Now they're screaming at the palace front gates, used to chant my name*  
*Now they're screaming that they hate me*  
*Never wanted you to hate me*

As she said in the documentary, being liked and thought of as good drove her. So the idea that someone hated her likely really upset her. This is her worst fear, all her fans turning on her and now hating her because she's come out, and her career goes down in flames on top of that.

Even though this song was written in the SN era, it seems like she was still grappling with this idea a decade later in The Archer, so I think it's conceivable that she could have been thinking this early on about what it would be like if she came out.

What do you think? Is this a ridiculous theory? This is my first lyric analysis so idk how good a job I did, pls be gentle lol.

""Impressive. Most Impressive"". Self-explanatory. 

""I find your lack of faith disturbing""--When music media figures, the wider industry, or the general public underestimates Taylor Swift (either success-related, as an artist, as a songwriter, etc.)

""Love is more than a candle. Love can ignite the stars."" (Revenge of the Sith Novelization). Love has always been what carried Taylor Swift forwards--and her love has shaped her discography which is now compared to the Beatles or William Shakespeare... 

 ""You know, no matter how much we fought, I always hated watching you leave.‚Äù **(The Force Awakens).** This seems very similar to ""Last Kiss"" or ""The Way I Loved You"" where watching someone leave is even worse than the fighting.

24039,"so i have seen here on reddit that many people are still discussing and speculating which person a specific song was written about, but speculating about anything else is apparently off limits.

i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs okay to speculate about her personal life, but i think that should also include discussing which person a specific taylor song is written about. 

also people get weirdly defensive about their interpretations about songs, cause that‚Äôs what it is. it‚Äôs weird to assume these things as if we know her.

I think doing this dismisses her creativity as a writer cause she is an amazing storyteller.
As a writer i can say none of my work is 100% fact or fiction. fictional work draws from reality and factual work usually has things changed to fit a narrative. There is evidence in older songs like ‚Äòspeak now‚Äô that she also hasn‚Äôt ever been 100% truthful in her writing.

But people still assume all too well is 100% objective fact and bully who they think it‚Äôs written about. when in actuality it‚Äôs only her side of the story and may not even be completely about jake.

I listened to Foolish One and realized that even though it's based on a romantic relationship, a lot of the same ideas apply: waiting for someone to come around and recognize you're worth the effort, hanging around in hopes they'll change. It finally clicked for me that I was doing the same thing to myself by staying in an unsupportive work environment, and that was part of the reason I started looking for alternatives.

But what I want to ask is, why is ""Christmas Tree Farm"" not as hyped as Ariana Grande's ""Santa Tell Me"" or Kelly Clarkson's ""Underneath the Tree"" outside the online Swiftie bubble? Ideally, if you consider Taylor's fame, ""Christmas Tree Farm"" would've had at least a week at the top of the Holiday Hot 100, like Justin Bieber's ""Mistletoe"" or ""Santa Tell Me"".

20329,"So I've been listening to the setlist in preparation for the show I'm going to in July.  And while I think the setlist is pretty great, I've been thinking about what I'd change.

So I thought it would be fun to try it out here with a couple rules I came up with.  Those rules being:

1.  Each era can only have the amount of songs that Taylor already put into the setlist.  So Speak Now only gets one song.  1989 gets five.  

2.  Hard mode (optional):  You can only change one song per era.

Anyway, here's mine:

Lover:  my only change is The Archer (it's boring!  Im sorry!) for Cornelia Street.

Fearless:  You're perfect, we aren't changing anything.

Evermore:  Tolerate It is out.  Dorothea is in.

Rep:  Delicate, baby, I'm so sorry.  But I *need* Getaway Car.

Speak Now:  Enchanted is out, Long Live is in.

Red:  I want to hear Babe so bad, but I don't think you can change those four.

Folklore:  Adios Illicit Affairs.  I don't like you.  Let's have The Lakes.

1989:  I actually think these are the right songs, but I'd still sub Clean for Bad Blood (and I'd also want Wonderland)

Midnights:  Midnight Rain goes.  You're On Your Own Kid is added.

33247,"Reposted cause apparently I need 30 karmas to be able to post here.

Hanni appeared in my dream last last week and now I can't just stop being obsessed with her.

This is definitely silly on my part and I find my situation funny at the same. Here's a background about me, I'm a metalhead, so you can get the idea that I listen to a lot of music and bands associated with metal and occasionally rock.

Having said that, k-pop is a genre that I rarely listen to as I don't really connect with it at all. I know some k-pop songs and groups, most notably Blackpink and Twice as my friend who is also a metalhead keeps on telling me about Twice and who is his bias.

Honestly, I also do jam to some of k-pop songs, but they're just mainstream or what was popular at that time.

Anyway, last January was the time OMG by NewJeans got popular, especially on TikTok. That Capcut edit really got me and it kinda hooked me into it. Idk, at that time I really didn't think I would enjoy a k-pop song that much like how I'm in love with OMG.

And with that I get to know the members of the group and instantly just chose Hanni as my bias. We probably all know why, her talents and also charm can attest to that. But honestly, I didn't really think much of it as I'm not really into k-pop.

And then I just knew Le Sserrafim and Gi-dle because apparently liking NewJeans content lets me see them on my FYP. Searched them on Youtube, listened to their songs, and my Youtube is now full of them three.

Moving on, last last week, for some reason, I dreamt of Hanni. After I woke up, I just thought that wtf why am I dreaming of her. And the rest of that day, I just can't stop thinking about her. I became obsessed, like I wanna see her pictures and what's happening with the band. I visit their Tiktok account to check, and I was actually waiting for their EP to get released sooner lmao.

So yeah, I actually don't know what happened to me. I listen to my playlist in Spotify, I listen to some Cannibal Corpse, and the next song is Attention.

21813," I'm counting down the days until my 13th birthday on July 14th, and I've made an exciting decision: I want my party to be an unforgettable Taylor Swift-themed extravaganza (for obvious reasons)! Being a die-hard Swiftie who fell in love with Taylor's music during the fearless (TV) era, this celebration feels like the perfect way to honor her incredible artistry. Now, I'm reaching out to you, my fellow Swifties, for your incredible Swiftie wisdom and creative ideas to make this party truly Taylor-themed.

Here's what I've come up with so far:

1. Invitations: I've planned to design online polaroids featuring my initials and birthdate. Flipping them will reveal the party details. What do you think of this idea? Any additional suggestions to make the invitations even more Taylor-inspired?
2. Cake: Inspired by u/sweetlikeciinnamonn's fantastic cake, I'm thinking of having a similar one at my party. I could also make my cake the lover  Any specific design ideas or suggestions to make it truly stand out?
3. Party favors: I've always been captivated by the friendship bracelets Swifties traded during Taylor's tours. As an international Swiftie, I'm not sure when Taylor will come to my country, so I thought it would be awesome to create customized friendship bracelets for my friends. I can even tailor them to match their favorite album, era, or aesthetic. What do you think of this idea? Any additional suggestions for unique and personalized party favors.

I genuinely appreciate your help in turning this birthday party into an extraordinary Taylor Swift dream come true! From d√©cor, activities and invitations to party favors, cake and food, your incredible ideas, suggestions, and Swiftie wisdom will make all the difference in creating an unforgettable experience.

Taylor really doesn‚Äôt write negatively about someone unless they were once close. She writes positively about people she doesn‚Äôt know (Enchanted, for example), but her sass & vengeance are reserved for people who she used to be tight with.

&#x200B;

**ISO:**

All ISO related posts should be commented in this megathread from now on. *Individual ISO posts will be removed.*

&#x200B;

**SELLING & TRADING:**

Please review the [selling](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwiftMerch/wiki/selling) & [trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwiftMerch/wiki/trading) rules before commenting. As a reminder, your Reddit account should be at least one month old if you want to sell or trade.

The *basic* rules are (but PLEASE review the full rules):

* **You MUST upload a photo of the items you are trading or selling** \- No stock images or images that are not yours. You can upload images to Imgur and share the link in a comment on this post. **THIS ALSO APPLIES TO TRADE OFFERS. Comment with a photo of your item you are offering to trade before private messaging.**
   * Any very RARE items should have a photo with a handwritten timestamp (your Reddit username and the date handwritten on a piece of paper).
   * i.e. ""Record Store Days"" Vinyl Records, 'Lover' Snow Globe, Signed Items, and Lithographs
* If you are interested in a sale or trade, comment ""Sent a private message to you. I accept your listed price or I have X item to trade"" so the moderator(s) know who is reaching out to who.
* No ""Taking offers"" comments - **Items being sold must have a clear price**. If anyone tries to sell something to you ABOVE their listed price - please let the moderators know.
   * If you want to negotiate a lower price or offer something else that is not an ISO, please do so in the comments first.
   * Insane price gouging is not allowed.
   * If you are unsure about the value of an item, feel free to make a post with the ""Fair Trade/Value Question"" flair.
* ***Please edit your comment once you've accepted an offer and tag the user you are selling or trading to.***
* **No trade or sale sniping** \- If an offer is accepted, other members should wait 24 hours before commenting to ask if the transaction went through. If two users make the same offer, the person who offered first gets priority.

There are a lot of scammers out there or bad sellers so these rules are in place to help protect the members of this subreddit. There are new members joining every day and some people are completely new to Reddit. No worries if you make some mistakes. PLEASE be wary about selling or trading to *ANYONE* who does not want to follow these rules (i.e. not uploading a photo and listing a clear price).",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwiftMerch/comments/13an30p/5723_iso_selling_and_trading_megathread/,"5/7/23 - ISO, Selling, and Trading Megathread",TaylorSwiftMerch,t3_13an30p,/r/TaylorSwiftMerch/comments/13an30p/5723_iso_selling_and_trading_megathread/,2023-05-07 13:01:35,Taylor Swift
