My hope is that all these different pockets will be compiled into somewhat of a narrative structure; ideally, he will be able to condense the narrative structure that spanned out in the trajectory from CLB, HNM, to HL; but this time, rather than over the course of three albums, he might be able to find a way to incorporate the different moods so that they hold narrative tension sonically; and, rather than each song proceeding the next in arbitrary manner, they might be arranged so as to exhibit the different transformations of a character in way that draws closer to causality; that is, a continuous unfolding of actions and reactions.",https://i.redd.it/utogxdfkhwrb1.jpg,Do y‚Äôall want this version of Drake on FATD?,Drizzy,t3_16ygdjp,/r/Drizzy/comments/16ygdjp/do_yall_want_this_version_of_drake_on_fatd/,2023-10-03 02:42:08,Drake

15223,"Personally, I won't say that it's a bad song, and by no means are the artists jks collaborating with untalented. But, I just feel like looking back at them & Jack Harlow + Latto, I'm a little underwhelmed by these features/collabs. Like I'm sure there are strategic reasonings for why he chose them, but they're kinda just...there for me. Versus like if he had done a collab with someone like the weeknd, doja cat, ariana etc. or other notorious idols I feel like that would've been a bit more of a serve.

He looks great in the video, and the song is a pretty easy listen so I like it for that. I also think his pronunciation has gotten so much better so it's clear he's been working on it which is admirable. Great vocals from him as always as well. Nothing extravagant, but I don't think all music needs to be. Overall a decent song for me, but nothing phenomenal. And I say this because I KNOW jk is capable of phenomenal.

14789,"Help, I (F15) have this girl, M(F15) who I dated 1 1/2 years ago and have been in love with this whole time. She‚Äôs an amazing person who can genuinely make me smile no matter the situation. A mutual friend said that she was getting tired of waiting around for me and wasn‚Äôt sure how much longer she can play cat and mouse with me.
 
She‚Äôs saved my life more times than I can count, all my firsts have been with her and I can‚Äôt see myself loving anyone else but her. 

We initially broke up because my parents were uncomfortable and I was worried about the consequences. They still are tense whenever I mention her too.

The tricky part is I go to a catholic school, while not having and strict rules about lgbtq. I get ridiculed and made fun of by peers and girl who I play sport with as well. I‚Äôve gotten a lot more used to this over the passed few years but it still bothers me. And I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôll get worse if I get back together with M.

My Dad is catholic and is against gay marriage as it isn‚Äôt what the bible ways (clich√© I know). My mother is supportive of everyone else but doesn‚Äôt understand where I ‚Äúwent wrong‚Äù. I talked about it previously but she wants me to explain why I‚Äôm gay. I can‚Äôt, there isn‚Äôt a reason. We live somewhat rural so anything I do has to go through them. I‚Äôve been laying low lately so it hasn‚Äôt really been an issue. They support me in every other way though, but this is the one part they can‚Äôt. 

I‚Äôve spoken with my mum about it and she says she won‚Äôt be comfortable with it, and most likely won‚Äôt support me. The closest to supportive was when she had a few wines and said it was my choice.

I‚Äôm stuck on what to do. I really don‚Äôt want to loose M, they mean a-lot to me but its hell having my parents uncomfortable and unsupportive towards me. I don‚Äôt know what to do. M asked me today what the hell we are and whats going on between us. I just need somebody‚Äôs perspective.

4960,"It was a seemingly regular day for Drake and his old man, they were walking through the mall, looking at everything that caught Drake's eye. ""Hey, Pops! Can we go look in the Lego store?""

""Not right now, Aubrey.""

""Pleeeeease?""

""I said no!""

""Pretty please with sugar on toooooop???""

Mr. Graham sighed ""...Alright, fine."" 

Drake was incredibly excited to look at all the Lego sets. He sprinted into the store with a wide grin on his face.

""Wowza! Look at all these cool Lego sets, Pops!"" 

Suddenly, a man charged into the store and pointed a gun at an employee, ""Put the money in the bag!"" Drake turned around and his jaw dropped to the floor ""Holy moly! Is that a real gun?!""

""Stay right here Aubrey."" Mr. Graham said in a serious tone, and he walked to the robber and started trying to reason with him. Drake, seeing this as an opportunity to finally get a cool Lego set, grabbed a box and started walking out.
A loud gunshot was heard, and the thief ran right past Drake. Drake turned around to see his old man lying on the floor in a pool of blood, ""NOOOOO!!! POPS!!!!"" Drake dropped the set and rushed to his father's side. ""NOOO DADDY!! DONT DIE ON ME!!"" Drake started sobbing uncontrollably. Mr. Graham let out a brief groan, ""Au-Aubrey, I'm sorry. I-I thought I could s-stop the criminal... Always remember, with great power, comes great responsibility."" And with those words, Mr. Graham let out one final breath.
""NOOOOO DADDY!!!!! DONT LEAVE ME DADDY!!!!""
After a couple minutes of sitting by his father's side, Drake left the mall. He cried the entire walk home.

After Drake got home, he rested in his bed for a while, reflecting on his experiences with his father. After a few sad weeks, Drake decided to hunt down his father's killer.

So Drake started training, he ran 2 miles everyday and spent 20 hours a week at the gym. In a couple months Drake was already incredibly strong, but he wanted to be stronger.

Drake decided to boost his strength with steroids.

Now Drake was really strong. He started investigating the criminal, he spent weeks trying to hunt him down. His work eventually payed off when he found the criminal trying to rob a Walmart.

""STOP! STOP IN THE NAME OF THE LAW!"" Drake squealed as he ran towards the robber and tackled him. Drake started punching the man in the face, over and over and over and over and over again, until the man was dead.

Drake sat there, speechless, he just beat a man to death. He sprinted out of the Walmart and his behind his bicycle.
""What have I become?"" Drake squealed, looking at his bloodied hands ""I'm a monster...""

He thought he would feel better after avenging his old man, but he felt sick. After a bit of pondering, Drake discovered that revenge isn't the answer.

After hours of thinking, Drake realized that he could try fighting crime like a superhero. So he started designing his own superhero costume. 

Fatherless, and with a new found sense of purpose, Drake now fights crime as ...SUPER DRIZZY",https://www.reddit.com/r/DrakeTheType/comments/18jmvjc/drake_the_type_of_violent_vigilante_to_start/,Drake the type of violent vigilante to start fighting crime after his dad dies.,DrakeTheType,t3_18jmvjc,/r/DrakeTheType/comments/18jmvjc/drake_the_type_of_violent_vigilante_to_start/,2023-12-16 08:30:00,Drake

So I listened to it over and over again. The more I listened the more I felt like the song sounded familiar. I was racking my brain trying to figure out which song it reminded me of. Then it hit me BTS's Black Swan. It's the rhythm of Taeyang's verse and BTS'S chorus are similar. Also after listening to both songs back to back I felt that the two songs have a similar vibe. Black Swan is actual, fully formed song while white night's intro was just a idea of the direction of the album. 

I just want people to listen to them and see if I'm crazy.

This rank took me a bit to write up since I didn't know how to order the releases from least favorite to favorite, but after listening and thinking about it, I figured out where to put everything. So now let's jump into all the things J-hope has done in his career and see where his songs rank.*¬†

**8.** [Chicken Noodle Soup (Feat Becky G)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_cNjeCrkKU)

*My Least favorite solo goes to Chicken Noodle Soup, which I only listen to when I'm in the mood. The bouncy instrumental works well with the rapping that J-hope brings to the table, sounding like something you expect from the artist. The chorus gets repetitive, but that doesn't take anything away. I'm not a Becky G fan, but she does a decent job adding to the overall vibe. Becky has a decent Spanish rap that works with the instrumental. After I listen to this song, I tend not to return to it for a while. This is a good solo, but not one that I see myself returning to or being impacted by.*¬†

**7.**[Intro: Boy Meets Evil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYmKrd5U_kg)

*The next solo is the intro J-hope did for the Wings album. I like this intro way more than Chicken Noodle Soup, which is way more interesting. Again, j-hope puts on a killer rap performance blending well with the instrumentation. Some of the vocal effects didn't need to be added. The drop is a little dry for me, but it doesn't take away from the overall vibe. Again, I find J-hope putting on a better performance than he did with Becky G. The way he delivers his rap is perfect as it starts off soft before he goes all-force. This solo is one I come back to more than Chicken Noodle Soup, but not as much as others.*¬†

**6.**[Trivia Ëµ∑: Just Dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xjZtbeKd4E)

*The next J-hope solo comes from Love yourself: Answer one that reminds me of something he could've put on Hope World. But, instead, j-hope goes for a more poppy vibe with hip-hop and dance elements. I remember loving this one when it first dropped, and I still love it. The hook is catchy, with a drop that could've been better, but I'm not bothered by it. This dance-pop sound blends well with the performance J-hope brings to the table. This is my least favorite of the trivia songs, but it's my favorite for a J-hope solo. I return to this song often since it works well for J-hope and occasionally gets stuck in my head.*¬†

**5.** [Mama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5BMmuwcGtg)

*We return to Wings album with another solo called Mama that J-hope brought to the table. An old film camera sound effect opens the track before J-hope spits fire. The bouncy backing track works well with his performance. The chorus has grown on me over the years, as I've seen myself return to this tune several times. I love the turntable scratching effects you can hear on the backing track. The second verse is one of my favorite sections, as so much fire is being brought to the table. This solo is one of the best from J-hope, but not my all-time favorite.*¬†

**4.** [Outro : Ego](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RagrKAFbkw0)

*J-Hope delivers an outro for Map the soul:7 one I often return to. RM has a small vocal part in the beginning before the bouncy rap from J-hope comes into the mix. I love his flow; he has so much fun putting on this performance. The hook is super catchy, as it always gets stuck in my head. I remember when they released the video for this track, and I wanted it on streaming immediately. J-Hope's rap in the second verse goes hard as it blends well with this bright vibe. The final chorus, with everyone singing, makes this the fourth-best solo from J-hope.*¬†

**3.** [Hope World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt-yOFYSxbs)

*In 2018 J-Hope released his long-awaited Mixtape, which hit hard as my 8th favorite album to release in 2018. Hope World opens up with the bright pop tune Hope world. J-hope's rapping on this project blends so well with the instrumentation as it sounds like something J-Hope would do. I love how the songs on this project flow together, making this an excellent record. P.O.P (Piece Of Peace) pt.1 is my favorite song on the album as it adds a steal drum to the mix, adding to the overall vibe. The crisp production still hits hard whenever I return to this project. Ìï≠ÏÉÅ (HANGSANG) Feat. Supreme Boi and Baseline are the two stand-out tunes as they hit harder than anything on this project. Airplane is another of my favorites, as it helps span the BTS sequel version. Blue side is an excellent outro, with a longer version released in 2021. After so many years, I still find this project to be a great album.*¬†

**2.** [1 Verse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUUDHykELoM)

*In 2015 J-hope dropped a short solo song that hit so hard it made me want more from him. 1 Verse sample, The Game, and Skrillex El Cameno fit J-hope's performance wonderfully. The flow of his rap keeps bringing me back for more over the years. The beat hits hard as the performance from J-hope makes me want more from this hard-hitting sound we got on Jack in the box. Even though this is a short solo, I hope we see it on streaming since it's my second favorite thing J-hope delivered to the table.*¬†

**1.** [Jack In The Box](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KIoCkpSAQ8)

*Jack In the Box is my favorite and the best solo release from J-hope, as it shows him growing as an artist and rapper. Pandora's Box comes in after the intro with J-hope spitting fire, keeping me engaged with the performance. I find myself coming back to this album all the time since it has some of my favorite performances from J-hope. The pre-release single More excited me for this project as I would always have that on repeat. More has this rock vibe mixed with a hip-hop backdrop that blends well with the performance. What if samples Shimmy Shimmy Ya which was cool to see J-hopes take on it. This album does have some catchy moments, like equal sign and Safe zone both keep getting stuck in my head. You will still see my listening to Jack in the Box on repeat.*¬†

*Ourealgoat is back with another new single released one month after his last one. Ourealgoat goes for this acoustic R&B-type tune that works well with his vocal delivery. Some rock elements blend well with the overall vibe. Jayci yucca features in the track, but his feature is only one of my favorite features. I like this song from Ourealgoat, but it's not my overall favorite track that the rapper has released in his career, but it's still one I can return to occasionally.*¬†

*Newjeans is back with a new single that is in collaboration with Coca-cola. The production sounds like something you expect from the group, but it feels underwhelming this time. I like the vocals the group brings, but it feels like it's missing something. The chorus is decent, not impressing me that much, but it's not taking anything away from the overall vibe. I wish they added something to make this tune more interesting than what gets delivered.

*CRUCiAL STAR released a remix of the QM's show me the Money song Come to my stu. The acoustic-rap tune fits well with QM's rapping in the original, but in the remix, Crucial Star delivers some decent bars that work well with the overall vibe. In addition, Lellamarz does the chorus, which adds to the vibe. The overall song is laidback vibe kept bringing me back to this tune this week. I still like the original version with QM's rap verse much better, but this remix still works for me.*¬†

[**ÎπôÍ∏ÄÎπôÍ∏Ä (Prod. by R.Tee) - Heize**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46dmtAdLYq0)

*Heize is back with a new single that teams up with producer R.Tee. I've always preferred R.Tee as his production sounds like typical YG music. The backing track goes for this dance-pop guitar loop-driven tune, which differs from what we usually hear from Heize. I'm not the biggest fan of what this song brings, as it does bring anything new. I prefer the R&B-driven tunes that Heize does since they work better for her and suit her voice more. It feels like whatever R.Tee produces, he makes it sound bland and forgettable. Such a waste to give Heize something that could be more useful.*¬†

[**ÏÇ¨Îûå Pt.2 (Feat IU) - Augst D**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1n95b3C87I)

*Suga is back with a pre-release single for his upcoming album. This pre-release single called People is a sequel to the 2020 song of the same name Suga released. This mid-tempo hip-hop tune blends well with the vocals IU delivers during the hook sections. Suga's smooth rapping makes me feel relaxed as he rides the beat pretty well. Nothing too grand is happening in this track, but the vibe is nice that you could drive to or relax to. This pre-release single makes me interested in what the rest of the album will sound like.*¬†

And I feel like this lack of Jimin content is driving us to the point of starvation, because Jimin biased armys and PJMs are literally ready to have a meltdown over the slightest of crumbs...

One unconfirmed appearance in Taeyang's insta upload has us feasting off of crumbs for days. The level of detailed analysis I've seen over his hair colour, whether that Weverse photo showed dark hair, or was it the lighting, was it a recent photo? Does his follow up photo with a beanie show stray strands are they blonde.. 

And now we're getting closer, after receiving tiny little teasers for the latter half of last year from producers he worked with, the wait is feeling unbearable. Whereas before I could put it to the back of my mind, every day I'm expecting to hear something.
 
.. How are we going to cope with an actual comeback? 

And it's not even just the waiting, it's how Jimin has become so quiet and private in general. If we actually get promo activities, dare I say comeback shows.. I don't think I'll survive. 

This is flagged as a shitpost because I don't have much to say apart from I need to vent a little or else I'll combust.

He has shared over the years moments of vulnerablity that he has experienced, in face of uncertainty and insurmountable odds. I believe that courage is not the absence of fear but facing the situation head on in spite of it.

I'm utterly grateful how open he has been about what he has gone through and sharing with us these little morsels of courage in the form of music and wisdom that he has slipped through. These morsels has taken me by the hand in this mad marathon of life, both in warmth and comfort. But also fuel to march on in spite of achy legs and wilting will. In spite moments of self inflicted weakness.

9659,"This is *not* about BTS, this question is really about all of the rest of successful kpop, all of the other Korean talent out there ... 

Some people in the music industry consider a Grammy to be a pinnacle win; others think it is just another important award to round out a list of awards won. What do you think?

Should more kpop artists - groups or solos - be trying to grab a Grammy win to add to their other accomplishments? Even just a nomination? 

NCT? Red Velvet? Twice? Blackpink? EXO? Shinee? Solos? ... and so on.

If so, what should they be doing to secure a nomination, and then a win? 

It is common for music artists that haven't won a Grammy to create a song that is targeted at a Grammy win, even if it isn't typical of their other music. Throughout Grammy history many artists have done this successfully. Is that targeted effort worth it, do you think?

Or does winning a Grammy even matter?**",https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/10wkbct/do_you_think_that_any_of_the_kpop_groups_or_solos/,Do you think that any of the kpop groups or solos should be trying to win a Grammy? *Other than BTS* -- asking about all of the rest of kpop talent! :),kpopthoughts,t3_10wkbct,/r/kpopthoughts/comments/10wkbct/do_you_think_that_any_of_the_kpop_groups_or_solos/,2023-02-08 02:08:57,BTS

14418,"fyi he a sub lurker. this is to you, metro. read and learn our frank thoughts of the bullshittery you doing lately.

let me first start that im no hater, metro literally is my #1 on spotify wrapped 2023. but his moves lately might make me reconsider streaming his stuff, and reevaluate him as both an artist and person.

for out of the loopers, yesterday he tweeted summin and deleted later disrespectful to drake. simply butthurt that Her Loss nominated for awards while his Hoes & Villains didnt. he blames it on ‚Äúpolitics.‚Äù hes clearly acting childishly, an an insecure, sensitive and an arrogant wazzock. he disrespects drake clearly and not only him, even his atl homie, 21 savage ! does this man want no friends or what ?!

this isnt the first time he does this. justa few weeks ago he clowned his own fans urging for the pluto collab album, he captioned ‚ÄúmETro DrOp tHe aLbuM‚Äù. again, he *mocked* his own fans. 

let us not forget the kidzania moves he did, redropping thug‚Äôs last album with the ‚Äúog‚Äù playlist and relocates drake‚Äôs intro somewhere else. and removing drake from trance. and drake exposing his ass being a snake gossiper with literal thots on more m‚Äôs track.

he is an egotistical snake who thinks hes genius just because he made an orchestra perform his Hoes & Villains. i mean give me 60k and i could make this happen for any crappy album out there. nothing is revolutionary about this. it didnt even get the shine he wanted, simply because it was meh.

he is now dragging pluto to a rabbit hole. pluto used to drop classix yearly, max. this dude in the name of a collab is ‚Äúcooking‚Äù forever. and now his passive aggression towards drake & 21 could pull a nerve with pluto and make that whole collab squashed.

Things I remember for sure:
It's yoonmin
Yoongi dies at the end
There's (namjin?) In it 
Yoongi and namjoon are kind of brothers and they are involved in some shady stuff
They are in highschool 

Things I think I remember:
The 7 of them were spilt into two (gangs?) and they both hated each other. They were like school gang rivals (this might be from another fic)

There was a scene were yoongi is smoking at the beach, and he talks to jimin.

I started with 4th gen groups and worked my way back.

In my defense, it was partly because I also read she had mental health struggles and figured this was the cause. Then I heard recently about public opinion turning on Mina and couldn't believe that of her... and, well, I was right this time.

So, I was just wondering that if you guys were BTS producers for a day and had to advice them regarding their English titles as a group or as a solo artist - What would that be???

From the looks of it i feel you guys expected them to create an English version of BST or Spring Day or Fake love, etc... or an english hip-hop track...or I'm I completely wrong.

Please don't hate me for this I'm just a casual BTS listener and personally I really enjoyed their English tracks OT7 and Solo combined. It was light, fun, groovy and easy to digest music which i really like.

10402,"> For All the Dogs is the eighth studio album by Canadian rapper and singer Drake. It was released on October 6, 2023, by OVO Sound and Republic Records. Its production was handled by Drake and frequent collaborators 40, Boi-1da, Vinylz and Oz, as well as Bnyx, Southside, Gordo, Tay Keith, Lil Yachty, Teezo Touchdown, and DJ Screw, among others. It features guest appearances from Teezo Touchdown, 21 Savage, J. Cole, Yeat, SZA, PartyNextDoor, Chief Keef, Bad Bunny, Sexyy Red, and Lil Yachty. [Source: Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_All_the_Dogs)

The album debuted #1 and sold 410K units in its first week, but apparently received lukewarm reception from many. Still, a month later, it is #3 on the charts, and has multiple songs in the top 40 of Billboard‚Äôs Hot 100 list; *IDGAF* featuring Yeat is #8, *First Person Shooter* featuring J Cole is #13, *Rich Baby Daddy* featuring Sexyy Red and SZA is #15, *Virginia Beach* is #22, and *Slime You Out* featuring SZA is #39.

An admitted Drake Stan, DJ Akademiks had said of the album that it sounded like for the first time in his career Drake was following instead of leading the way. [On Halloween](https://i.redd.it/s4oov5n1gkxb1.jpg), however, DJ Akademiks [tweeted](https://twitter.com/Akademiks/status/1719389599636627539) ‚ÄúAlmost a month after its release ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúFor All The Dogs‚Äù sounding a wholeee lot better.

Its being said that Andrew Watt going to produce JB upcoming album. He has been producing tons of hits including JB hits like peaches.

I know alot of people dislike JB n scooter braun, but like it or not, you cant deny that JB is so huge and always have a hits. This gonna elevate another career high for Jungkook. Noticed that since BTS chapter 2, jungkook being taking only high profile gigs/collabs(world cup, charlie puth collab, calvin klein) n all turned out very successful.

What i know, high possibility we getting full pop song by this duo. If this collab so successful, this not gonna surprise if jungkook gonna get nominated for grammy whether on pop duo/group category n also major categories. Because JB has always get nominated for major awards.

So what you guys think?

BLACKPINK's Jennie has become the center of attention once again as she recently shared a photo on social media that coincidentally featured the same outfit she wore during the alleged date with BTS' V in Paris. The dating rumors between the two idols have resurfaced, sparking curiosity among fans and the public.

On the 12th, Jennie uploaded several photos on her social media account with the caption ""few weeks back."" The snapshots captured her wearing a stylish ensemble, consisting of a white bucket hat, cropped cardigan, and jeans. To add a touch of flair, she accessorized with a blue check scarf, mini chain cross bag, and sunglasses.

What caught everyone's attention was the fact that this outfit closely resembled the one she wore during the supposed rendezvous with V in France last May. Back then, a video of Jennie and V strolling hand in hand along the banks of the Seine River in Paris surfaced online, creating a buzz. While the two individuals in the video had their faces concealed by hats, many speculated that they were indeed Jennie and V. French freelance journalist Amar Tahualit even went as far as stating, ""This is a video taken in Paris with an iPhone. I definitely saw Jennie and V.""

At the time, V was attending a fashion event, while Jennie had traveled to France to participate in an international film festival. Despite the attention the dating rumors garnered last year, neither Big Hit Music, V's agency, nor YG Entertainment, Jennie's agency, released any official statements regarding the matter.

The reemergence of the dating speculation has left fans divided. Some are excited about the possibility of a romantic relationship between two K-pop powerhouses, while others express concern about the potential impact on their careers. It is no secret that dating within the entertainment industry can be a sensitive topic, as it may affect an idol's popularity and the fan base's perception.

In recent years, several idols have chosen to publicly address their relationships, signaling a shift in the industry's culture. However, there are still many who prefer to keep their personal lives private, avoiding potential scrutiny and maintaining a professional image.

As fans eagerly await an official statement from either Jennie or V's agency, it is important to remember that celebrities are entitled to their privacy. While the dating rumors may generate excitement and speculation, it is crucial to respect the personal boundaries of these artists and support them in their professional endeavors.

Whether the dating rumors turn out to be true or not, one thing remains certain: the undeniable talent and charisma of both Jennie and V continue to captivate audiences worldwide.

For Korea‚Äôs concert, I see many K-pop idols are spotted to attend concerts from different companies. I can‚Äôt speak for other group‚Äôs international concerts. Feel free to add your observations.

FiftyFifty is such a dark horse, of course it is not exactly the same, since ""Cupid"" is immensely successful outside S.Korea, than it is there.

7460,"Still pretty sad over what I ended up doing but in honor of Ed‚Äôs AMA tmr, I thought I‚Äôd share this for all the lucky people going to the Vegas show / future mathematics shows / other 360 degree stage shows in the future. I hesitated to share this before the tour was over because I didn‚Äôt want ppl to have a bad time based on my advice lol, so I think just take this with a grain of salt / confirm it again on your own haha

Basically as we prolly all know, even tho the stage is 360 and Ed does run the hell out of it, he does face one side for a lot of the songs. And if you look at my previous post, you can see I invested a lot of time looking into that hahah. Based on what he did at concerts in like Philly, Atlanta, Arlington, Houston, Tampa, etc, I formed the theory that he always faces the EAST SIDE of the stage. So it doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with where the walkway is, home / away sides, etc. It‚Äôs just literally the east. I think artists with 360 stages would do this because then the sun is always setting behind them, esp with outdoor stadiums

So I bought seated tickets for MetLife based on this theory, I was right and had an amazing time!! Unfortunately, my main excitement was on GA for SoFi, and while I marked the right side to stand ahead of time (see picture), I was so frazzled at the stadium that I stood on the wrong side. I had never been to SoFi before and read the numbers wrong. üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ I should‚Äôve just kept the walkway to my left, and I didn‚Äôt realize until the day after that it was on my right. So I had thought that my theory was wrong when the concert started, but now I think it‚Äôs right, and I was just an idiot in execution instead. 

So yeah, still had a pretty great night overall. Just stared at the back of his head a lot lol. And I got to go to the subtract show at the shrine which was amazing!!! But I‚Äôm just kicking myself cause idk when he‚Äôs coming back to America again, and I wish I hadn‚Äôt been so stupid that I missed seeing my favorites like castle on the hill and Bloodstream in front up close. Still kinda down about the whole thing tbh, since I tried so hard to get it right and almost, almost did. (But least some of my other fav songs like Give Me Love - my ALL TIME favorite - and end of youth were pretty much spun around the whole time.)  Hopefully I get to go to another mathematics show some time in the future, and he keeps some of the old fan favorites on the setlist ü§ûüèº

I've been waiting for updates on Joy regarding the tour as I know she's not well at the moment. I know it was announced she wouldn't take part in the Japan concert this week and also now Manila and Bangkok but I can't much about Europe. I've found sources say it's yet to be decided and others saying she's not continuing with the tour at all.

I'd like to know if anyone has a more reliable source with more information. Me and my friends are waitinf for UK tickets to be released, one of my friends is meant to coming over from Norway for the concert so we just want to know if Joy is going to be there, or if they are going to carry on without her. Or even just cancel the Europe leg as we haven't even had tickets released yet.

9396,"Tried posting this on kpopthoughts but they‚Äôre taking FOREVER to approve it because they think this belongs in the 3D megathread even though I don‚Äôt mention 3D once hereüò≠ANYWAYS

I know after Seven came out, it was revealed by a news outlet that his solo album would be a full English endeavor but it was never really confirmed. With the [Golden tracklist](https://x.com/bighit_music/status/1713570481612439557?s=46&t=dJQt5zu645R5lMOksIoJ1A) that was just released today, it‚Äôs pretty safe to say that the album will be fully on English with an all Western producing and songwriting team! 

I think with JK‚Äôs goals to become a big pop star, this is what is needed. A full English album with solid pop songs with great professional producers and songwriters. I know some fans are disappointed that he has no writing or producing credits but it‚Äôs really not a huge deal. I‚Äôm sure so many producers were sending him songs and I‚Äôm looking forward to the songs chosen because there‚Äôs A LOT of big names on this album. DJ Snake, Major Lazer, Diplo, Shawn Mendes, Ed Sheeran, Jon Bellion and more! With this I‚Äôm expecting some club bangers and also some slower, angstier stuff. The main track, Standing Next To You, is produced by Andrew Watt and Cirkut, the same producers for Seven so that‚Äôs exciting. We may have another mega hit incomingü§≠

To think that Seven was the song that inspired JK to get back into making music after almost a year long break is crazy to think about. Without Seven who knows if we would have Golden right now. Actually JK wasn‚Äôt even planning on releasing an album before his enlistment so thank you Andrew Watt and Cirkut lol. 

I‚Äôm glad that JK felt more motivated after releasing Seven and I hope that his dreams continue to become true!

6113,"I should warn you...a lengthy post incoming. I did not attend the show, these are just the ramblings of someone who's watched the bootleg phone recordings of the whole album from the NY gig and has many thoughts....

To all = fans, I am so sorry because that album is about to be a GLARING blotch on Ed's discography. While I suspect Subtract will be his least commercially successful work, the album will shine as Ed's best work to date. This could be initial hype, or recency bias, but I have a gut feeling about this record.

Ed shines in every aspect on this record. His lyricism has never been better, as we see him evoke vivid metaphors and imagery, against a backdrop of lush and atmospheric production. For example, the chorus of Saltwater uses words such as 'kiss' 'dream' 'free', beautiful words contrasted against a melancholic piano and the overall depressing subject matter of the song. On the studio version, you can hear some whistling(?) in the back which really drives home the extended metaphor of the sea throughout the record. Morevoer, his soothing and gentle vocal delivery on the track, once again, contrasted with the dark subject matter, adds to the somber mood of the song.


His vocals also shine in this record best. I have already mentioned their effective use on Saltwater(almost like a lullaby). Another stand out vocally is End Of Youth, where Ed's vocals in the chorus soar as he expresses his pent up frustration with how unfair it is that tragedy takes our child-like innocence away. It reminded me of the song When We Were Young by Adele which also focuses on what is lost with our youth, and how Adele's vocals soar in the final chorus. Life Goes On also stands out as you can hear his yearning, his confusion on how he is supposed to continue with the loss of his friend, as he demands the answers on how to cope with death moving forward. Borderline, a song about Cherry's sickness, has Ed singing in his head voice. Aaron says he gave Ed tracks that could help his voice stand out, and it shows.

The melodies are also...interesting coming from Ed. These aren't your standard Sheeran melodies. While there are some similarities such as the melodic progression in ""hanging out with the sandman"" being identical to ""elements to remind me"" on Boat, and Life Goes On having a similar delivery style as the verses on Visiting Hours, those are the only ones I can pinpoint (and Aberfeldy which hearkens back to Multiply days). Ed has never disappointed with choruses, and I'm glad to say it's the same on this record. Now to review the individual tracks:

1. Boat- stunning opener. It doesn't try to reach the heights of Tides, because it doesn't need to. It sets the overall tone of the record. The lyrics which compare the sea to turbulent times in life are a stand out in his discography. An overall mellow song compared to the heights in the rest of the record.

2. Saltwater- I have already said enough about this song,.but I figure it will be a track folks will visit less because of potentially triggering lyrics.
Stunning track nonetheless.

3. Eyes Closed- probably one of the weaker songs on the album, tbh, in almost every aspect. I understand however that it was the safest option as the lead single, due to the earwormy chorus, as a way to transition between = and -. I don't hate the song, but other tracks outshine it on almost every regard. An important song for Ed, but one for the charts tbh, and a middling success in that regard.

4. Life Goes On- I have already covered this one. Need I say more?

5. Dusty- I can tell this song will not be a fave among Sheerios. The song is unlike what we're used to Ed, something that could be found in his songs pre +. I adore the song. A lighter moment in a heavy record, whose place in the album cannot be understated. And the music video could never be cuterüòç. Ed's inner child was awake on this one.

6. End Of Youth- an immediate stand out...my biases want it to be the next single(should've been the lead single tbh) but I digress. I have already gushed about it enough. Also, its placement on the track list is interesting, given that it comes right after a song embracing Ed's inner child(and literal child too lol)

7. Colourblind- this song sounds like a hug...another attempt of Ed exploring metaphors, this time, using various colours to attribute to love.  Did I mention how cute and fluffy this piano ballad makes me feel? Has potential to be one of those first dance songs, or wedding songs tbh. We all know Ed can't shake off a corny, on- the- nose love song, but this one stands as one of his better love songs in recent memory, after the generic attempts on =

8. Curtains- The euphoric high that the chorus gives. The lead up from the verses...impeccable. Sounds a lot like a song that would be on √ó, with an unexpected lead up to the chorus.

9. Borderline- hello, head voice, upper register, the first Cherry song(which are surprisingly short compared to the others)...a stand out vocally.

10. Spark- has one of Ed's most interesting melodies as well. Not much to say on this one but could grow on me over time.

11. Vega- the lyric 'it hurts like hell to be Vega', on Ed's admission, makes zero sense, but I appreciate the effort lol. A good song, not great, at least not yet imo.

12. Sycamore- the famous 'Love in Love Out'...one of the better songs inspired by Cherry throughout his career. Once again, the vivid lyricism shines through...a hopeful song during turbulent times.

13. No Strings- Another stand out. We see Ed take on a new angle on love. Side note, I find it hilarious that the song is called 'No Strings' and is quite literally a piano ballad. 

14. The Hills Of Aberfeldy- excellent closer...while not tied to the rest of the album in any way, it embraces how far Subtract(and Ed) has come since the song was written more than a decade ago. It also opens up the door on exploring the original version of Subtract.


Minor gripes:

1. Some of the Cherry songs felt shorter compared to the rest of the album. I just wanted...more.

2. Eyes Closed as the lead single...the sonic palette of this record isn't one for the charts, so why even attempt at trying anyway. I DON'T HATE THE SONG BTW(I get the label needs its millions but come onü§î) End Of Youth is literally the undiscovered super model.

What I'm looking forward to:

The visual album. I have suspicions some of the songs will have more of visualizers (Vega just sees Ed walking around in a circle on a carving of the star...on loop so Idk)instead of literal music videos...but this is the most Ed has given us visually, and we should be grateful. Particularly excited for Borderline, Curtains, Boat and Saltwater music videos.

9623,"Many would probably forgive BTS if they would want to skip the smaller, local Korean awards after topping BB Hot 100 that many times, winning the AMA Artist of the Year and winning multiple Grammy nominations. And with how busy they must be, some would even have expected BTS to maybe not record a video (as is the case for some other ""global"" artists) since they have so many of these local accolades already anyways.

But as many of you may have just saw at the Golden Disc Award tonight, my boy JHope just freaking flew ***6 hours*** from Korea to Thailand (and another 6 hours back after this btw) just to accept the award ***in-person***, to give a very very personal and heartfelt speech to personally thank Army and each other. They have not taken local shows for granted and always take any chances to talk to and thank Army whenever, and now literally *wherever* ROFL, they can.

It‚Äôs 11:30 p.m. on October 12, and the Jos√© Miguel Agrelot Coliseum in San Juan, Puerto Rico, is packed. More than 16,000 Bad Bunny superfans have gathered to become the first people on the planet to hear their hometown hero‚Äôs new album. Nobody knows what to expect.

The boundary-defying artist whose previous four studio albums have spanned hip-hop, reggaeton, Latin pop, Puerto Rican trap and Mexican country music. Tonight‚Äôs crowd embodies that vast spectrum: Hundreds are dressed in the white T-shirts and flat-brimmed blue caps from his recent song ‚ÄúUn Preview.‚Äù Others sport the cowboy hats from ‚ÄúWhere She Goes.‚Äù Many simply wear bunny ears.

‚ÄúI listened to a lot of salsa on my dad‚Äôs side, lots of ballads and merengue on my mom‚Äôs side. But being a ‚Äô90s kid, reggaeton and rap too,‚Äù says Bad Bunny in an interview in his native Spanish. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs lots of artists from different genres, countries and times that I feel are within me.‚Äù

If there‚Äôs one constant about Bad Bunny, who is 29, it‚Äôs that whatever he creates becomes a world- wide hit. Over the last three years, the alumnus of the [2019 Forbes 30 Under 30 list](https://www.forbes.com/30-under-30/2019/music/#be69bfd4c40b) has been Spotify‚Äôs most-streamed artist, with 35.9 billion plays. His YouTube channel has attracted more than 32 billion views. He has won three Grammys and 11 Latin Grammys. In April, he made history as the first Latin artist to headline the Coachella music festival.

And he‚Äôs done it all while singing solely in Spanish. ‚ÄúSpanish is part of me, it‚Äôs in my DNA,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI like speaking it wherever I go‚Äînot to force it on people, but because it‚Äôs who I am.‚Äù

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mgeuig6udw2c1.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4f90caf56fe9f5d2a9d769487ba83aef56cb2a3b

It has made him extremely wealthy. Last year, Bad Bunny earned an estimated $88 million (pretax) from world tours, billions of streams and high-profile brand deals with the likes of Adidas and Corona. That performance was good enough for a debut in the No. 10 spot on [*Forbes‚Äô* Highest- Paid Entertainers](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisettevoytko/2023/02/13/the-worlds-top-10-highest-paid-entertainers-of-2022/?sh=5663032729a3) list.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about the money all the time,‚Äù he says about how he picks partners. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about how much I love the brand and how much they‚Äôre going to respect my creativity.‚Äù

Back in the arena, the audience explodes as Bad Bunny descends from the ceiling, perched atop a Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow.

Tonight, the musician is wearing a fitted burgundy suit with a white button-down shirt open halfway. His face is covered in a mask reminiscent of Spider-man‚Äôs, but black with glowing red eyes. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very shy about playing new songs that haven‚Äôt been released yet,‚Äù he says. He hits play on his iPhone and the listening party for his album *Nadie Sabe lo que va a Pasar Ma√±ana (No One Knows What Will Happen Tomorrow)* Berupts.

Despite not knowing any of the lyrics, the crowd screams and dances to the new tracks. Bad Bunny doesn‚Äôt sing, save for the two songs from the album that he released earlier in the year. His face remains shrouded until after the clock hits midnight, whereupon he pulls off his mask to re- veal his new buzz cut, which, like the new album, pays homage to the early trap-style music that first shot him to global fame.

Bad Bunny hasn‚Äôt limited himself to music. Earlier this year, he appeared in the Amazon Prime film *Cassandro.* In October, he did double duty as the host and musical guest of *Saturday Night Live.* A digital version of Bad Bunny is body-slamming opponents in the blockbuster wrestling video game *WWE 2k23.* All this in a year that he had declared a time of rest.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ttr22xwydw2c1.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6d745db483d096af88a06bf37b7b951785010976

His broad appeal allows him to move effortlessly from WWE cage matches to Italian couture. This fall, he appeared in Gucci ads, promoting its high-end Savoy luggage alongside supermodel Kendall Jenner*.* In the past he has partnered with Crocs, the cult rubber clog company, dropping a line of glow-in-the-dark shoes in 2020. They quickly sold out. Also sold out was his latest shoe with Adidas, the $160 ‚ÄúPaso Fino‚Äù trainer.

Before he was a worldwide superstar, Bad Bunny was simply Benito, an audiovisual communications student at the University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo. When he wasn‚Äôt in class, he bagged groceries at Econo stores and created Latin trap songs he‚Äôd upload to SoundCloud.

Everything changed in 2016, when his trap single ‚ÄúSoy Peor‚Äù (‚ÄúI‚Äôm Worse‚Äù) transformed Bad Bunny into a household name. Full-force fame came with the release of ‚ÄúDiles Remix‚Äù the same year. By 2018 he was collaborating with some of the biggest names in music, including Drake, Cardi B and J Balvin. 

‚Äú\[I\] can live off music,‚Äù he says. But he won‚Äôt settle for just that. There will be more surprising brand partnerships, acting gigs‚Äîand, down the road, his own fashion brand. All while never forgetting Puerto Rico.

His native island is central to his image‚Äîand his business. In 2021, he became co-owner of the Santurce Cangrejeros, a local pro basketball team. To support homegrown talent, he has started a sports management agency called Rimas Sports.

He‚Äôs building a charity arm, too. In 2018 he created the Good Bunny Foundation, a San Juan nonprofit that supports artistic and sports opportunities to children in Puerto Rico. It has given away roughly $2 million over the last two years. ‚ÄúIn the absence of the government, it is artists that end up fulfilling those roles,‚Äù he says.

Whether Bad Bunny has the multidecade staying power of Madonna or Prince remains to be seen. But don‚Äôt expect him to spend too much time chilling out poolside at one of his mansions. He feels his obligation to those millions of fans, online and off. ‚ÄúFame,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúpushes me to keep working.‚Äù

9782,"June 24 is a really special day for me, since 2 of the most fun and memorable songs were released simultaneously on the same day, and the artists happened to be my 2 biggest favorites!

Some fun facts about the songs:

**""Left and Right"" - Charlie Puth (ft. JungKook of BTS)**

Charlie Puth originally teased this song as a solo track in February via TikTok. Two months later however, he tweeted about a dream where BTS featured on the song (which was received by waves of excitement from fans). And while the the whole group wasn't part of the song, Charlie was able to collaborate with one of his long time admirers, Jungkook!

Jung Kook extended his record for having the biggest single debut by a South Korean soloist on Spotify with Left and Right. The song recorded 6.792 million streams in its first day of release, debuting at no. 3 on the Spotify Global chart. The song also debuted at #22 on the Billboard Hot 100.

  
**Pop - Nayeon**

I had heard someone say this about the song - ""Pop put the pop back in K-pop"", and i couldn't agree more! The song's sound was a throwback to TWICE's amazing bubblegum pop era and it created a viral dance trend its catchy hand choreography

Pop attained the #2 position on the Circle digital chart, #5 on the Billboard Japan Hot 100 and also achieved the prestigious triple crown at Inkigayo. Nayeon also became the first Korean soloist in history to debut in the top 10 of the Billboard 200 (at #7).

9930,"V is the most famous bts members, he is well known from GP about his visual and trended a lot. I expected his debut, as final member who be the final card and can hit many records. the only record he break is sales album, which is amazing. but when you looking at digital chart, it did poor, more worse than rapline which is suprising. He didn't debut in top 10 bugs, a chart where even 4th nugu bgs able to chart in top10. 

His fans might use 'he hasn't promoted it in big variety show, just wait' but one performance isn't going to make some extraordinary difference unless it goes viral which is not an easy task, plus it is not catchy like Seven. And he actually promoted  a lot than other members. 

And  I don't accept GP does not like his songs because of genres, which is ridiculous. He is bts members, he should be able to debut top 10 bugs but he didn't.

This was pretty difficult. Wikipedia was a big help on this as far as sequencing the Stoney tracks. I stuck to the order they were released as singles. Which makes more sense than the album order honestly. Feeling Whitney wasn't a single so I put it after the singles. For TCT I felt that it worked better in reverse so that's what I did. In general I kept features to a minimum. Also a good rule is if you have two similar sounding songs, go with the better of the two. That's why I removed take what you want. It's similar to Hollywood's Bleeding but not as good. Still a great song but not everything can make the cut. 

What are your thoughts? The good, the bad the ugly! What would you do differently?

And For people shocked I left certain tracks off... I can't fit them all. Which is both frustrating and exciting. It really forces you to prioritize and focus on the songs that mean the most to you.

9877,"On July 12th, 2013, the rookie group Bangtan Sonyeondan celebrated their 1 month debut anniversary. On this occasion, they would release a song that gave the world a true look on what the biggest group in K-Pop felt a month after their debut. The song was aptly named ""[Born Singer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XsP4I9ds4c)"".

Let's go through this masterpiece!

**\[Intro: Jung Kook, V\]**

The intro starts with group talking about how they feel like they are born singers, and how this fact doesn't feel like an illusion to them anymore after their debut

>*I'm a born singer, a little belated confession, I swear*  
*The mirage that was always far away is right in front of my eyes (it's here)*  
*I'm a born singer, maybe an early confession (early confession)*  
*Anyway,‚ÅüI'm‚Åüso‚Åühappy, I'm good,‚Åüwhoa, whoa, yeah-yeah*

**\[Verse 1: SUGA\]**

The first verse is sung by to Suga, where he looks back to where he started off from and where he is now. Here he confesses that even though there have been many struggles till now, being able to perform on stage, with people cheering him on have, make it bearable for him.

>*For the first time in my life, I stood on a stage under the name of Bangtan*  
*I reexamine the heart of the first stage three years ago*  
*I am still no different from a hillbilly rapper in Daegu*  
*But I overwrote the word pro over the word amateur.*  
*When I danced and rapped on the stage I wanted so much*  
*I feel that I am still alive*  
*It's bearable, 'cause my people are watching*  
*Even if my body hurts, I can endure it, because the cheers are pouring in*

The next part deals with the hate they had gotten in those early days, where people questioned the authenticity of their rap and told them they weren't real rappers since they were now idols. Through his powerful lyrics, Suga conveys that he is still a rapper, just like 3 years ago, and that nothing has changed for him in this regard.

>*The difference between before and after debut; On the border between idol and rapper*  
*Even though I live, my notebook is still full of rhymes*  
*Between the waiting room and the stage, take a pen and write lyrics*  
*What has changed in your eyes?*  
*Damn, shit, I'm still the same*  
*did I change? (What?) Go and tell*  
*I keep my essence without change, I'm still rapper, man*  
*I rap and sing like three years ago, I'm out*  


**\[Chorus: Jung Kook, Jin\]**

>*I'm a born singer, a little belated confession, I swear*  
*The mirage that was always far away is right in front of my eyes (it's here)*  
*I'm a born singer, maybe an early confession (early confession)*  
*But I'm so happy, I'm good, whoa, whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah*  


**\[Verse 2: RM\]**

The second verse starts with RM openly revealing his feelings and moments of self-doubt during the group's debut period. He talked about being afraid of not being able to live up to the claims he has made and letting down the people who believed in him. But even with these concerns in mind, he straightens himself and moves on to face his debut

>*I was afraid to be honest*  
*The fact that the kid who only knew pens and books is now surprising the world*  
*I don't know, I was afraid of being too asymmetrical with the world's expectations*  
*I'm afraid I'll betray everyone who believed in me*  
*But I straighten my shoulders and make my debut*  
*The moment of silence, get my breath back*  


He then gives us a vivid description of what the debut felt like to him, how 3 years to blood and sweat and fighting with the mic came to those 3 minutes on stage, and how it felt to have people who he watched watching him now.

>*The people I used to watch are watching me now*  
*The ones I always looked up on TV are now under me*  
*Uh, without a chance to pass like a kaleidoscope, the one-time play has begun*  
*Evaporated in three minutes, my three years of blood and sweat, fighting with the bloody mic*  
*It only lasted for a few tens of seconds, but I poured it out clearly, I'm f-king real*  
  
*Hey man, what's your dream? I'm going to be a rap star, can't you feel?*  
*And the moment it came down, that shout, yeah, I could read your mind (uh, yeah)*  
*I could read your mind, only a smile with a question mark (uh, yeah)*  
*Without a word, the members just tapped on my shoulder*  
*It seems like yesterday, but 20 nights have passed*  


And for a cherry on top, he ends the verse with a good-old fashioned callout to the haters!

>*And let the haters hate on me, what they always do*  
*I filled my dreams while you guys were playing the keyboard*  
*Sunglasses, hairstyle, I know what you're swearing at*  
*Anyway, I'm better than you at the age of 20, haha*  


**\[Chorus: V, Jimin\]**

**\[Verse 3: j-hope\]**

In the last verse, J-Hope gives us an heartfelt description of the times leading up to their debut and how their emotions welled up when they finally made it.

>*The days we ran, the days we went through together*  
*For three years, our hearts became one*

The last verse is sung as A Capella with handclaps, which invites ARMY to sing along with them, whenever they perform this song live

9965,"i just felt like i had to talk about this somewhere. for reference, this post is referring to  jungkook‚Äôs ‚Äúchapter 2‚Äù solo music (exclusively seven and 3D). 

i‚Äôve been a huge bts fan since 2018. i‚Äôve listened to their entire discography, they‚Äôve been my top artist on spotify for 5 straight years, and i‚Äôve spent my tween and teen years with them. speaking personally, i haven‚Äôt enjoyed bts‚Äô solo chapter 2 music as much as i hoped i would. besides like crazy and indigo nothing much has stood out to me. not because it‚Äôs bad (bts have yet to release a bad song and i don‚Äôt think they ever will), just because the music isn‚Äôt really for me.

i‚Äôm writing this post about jungkook because his solo work has achieved the most international success and is known best by the general public. as talented as that man is, seven and 3D both seem so hollow to me. i don‚Äôt like jack harlow or latto very much, and the western features just feel like a key to the hot 100. 

compared to jungkook‚Äôs bts solo music (euphoria, still with you, begin, my time) i just think these songs don‚Äôt have much of a spark. obviously a song doesn‚Äôt have to be super unique to be good, but seven and 3D just feel like every other american pop song. part of what drew me into bts was their unique music concepts, and in my opinion these songs just lack that.

at the end of the day, the most important thing is that jungkook is making the music that he wants to make. i‚Äôll always love him and bts.

6888,"It feels weird writing this out as I‚Äôd never care enough to send something to an artist and it feels personal to share.  I doubt he will see this so maybe this is more of a letter to myself.  I know he was nervous releasing his last album since it was so personal.  I wanted to thank him along with I‚Äôm assuming everyone else who has a story about dealing with loss.  This is my experience and how it helped.

My entire life I have feared the loss of my father, I watched for years as he declined and it was profoundly saddening.  Then his single F64 came out and shortly after Boat and Eyes closed released and I remember thinking this album will be helpful some day when I eventually deal with one of the worst moments of my life.  Twenty five days after his album released, I celebrated my birthday with him and he enjoyed his album but joked about being no Elton John (He loved him and also loved giving me shit).  Two days later he passed unexpectedly and I saw it happen.  The song saltwater played in my head during the initial phases of shock.  

The songs hit so differently now when you actually live through grief that is so heavy it feels like it has its own gravity.  Time moves so slowly and the grief hits you in waves like he described in boat.  Thank you for sharing what you did,  it is helpful to have things you had trouble describing put into words and the experience is relatable.

His celebration of life ended up getting scheduled for August 26th, I already had tickets for your show in Seattle and it will be helpful to attend afterwards.  Wasn't planned this way but it'll work itself out.  Will miss the openers but will be there for when he takes the stage.

6087,"Hey everyone. After all my ""Subtract information"" posts, I can finally say that I have heard the album, except the bonus tracks. Here is my reaction (could change my mind obviously). Some lyric references or quotes may not be the exact words, but paraphrases from his explanations or almost what he sang.  Can't check of course, so may have switched a word or misheard something, though I am fairly sure of most of it. And some things may have already been said. Here we go!

General
* It blew my socks off. Truly memorable record. Not pop. At all. Tiny hint of it in ""Eyed Closed"" I guess. I can't predict people's reactions, it could go all sorts of ways with these songs. But personally, I loved it with all my heart. This is ed baring his soul for everyone to see. Never been this open and vulnerable. 
* Ed was super nervous about the show
* Ed said Aaron understands him so well
* Aaron seems to perfectly understand what Ed needs in terms of arrangements, style, instrumentation, sound, etc.
* Arri Alexa LF mini cameras were used to capture the show (Camera guy told me)
* About 64 or 74 tracks of audio were used, which I think includes mics in the audience (sound guy told me, forgot the exact number of audio tracks)
* No phones policy was great, no distractions, more connections!
* Lewis Capaldi attended (sadly didn't see him...)
* Brenda and Tanisha Edwards also attended
* It seemed like talking about Cherry's illness was he hardest thing for Ed. He would cry mentioning Jamal, but could hardly say a word about Cherry's situation, except that he got sent some instrumentals by Aaron when he was driving Cherry to some experts, to see how she could get better. 
* It felt like Ed's 'coming out' as a singer-songwriter. He mentioned how he felt he may have been too young to be one after plus, but now that he is 32, he finally feels like he can be one. Maybe he thought he had to live some more. This is the Ed many have been waiting for. 
* There he was, the man, the myth, the legend, speaking from his soul. The darkest and brightest parts, all laid bare in 14 songs. That is Subtract. 
* Some music video previews were displayed above/behind him, looked amazing, strong visually. 
* It really is a record for himself, to sort of process it all, the ""worst month"" of his life. Now we have to truly listen, and support him in this, because we care about him, not just about the songs. Critics will always hate, whatever he does, though I guess there is a chance they'll suddenly turn and praise him, saying he finally convinced the naysayers or something stupid like that
* Looking at the comments here on reddit... Incredibly shocked by some of them. Lots of assumptions about the sound of the record, the lyrics maybe not being good, lot of folks seem to think it couldn't be great because they didn't like his recent output (which is fair of course, you don't have to love everything, every opinion is fair). I was super surprised by how many poetic lines there were in these songs.
* Acoustic record doesn't mean just acoustic guitar, it means stripped back, mostly 'live' instruments, not overproduced, no (or at least hardly any) effects on his vocals, etc. That's what Subtract is. I just feel like people need to be open, that is all. Of course it's been hyped up, mostly by Ed himself, but just keep an open mind. Don't take my word for it, just wait and see. If songs work well live, that proves to me that they are good. They did, and I think they are. They may not be as great on the record, which is true for quite a few of Ed's songs, but I am under the impression that they'll be pretty much the same on vinyl as what I heard live. I listened to all of Ed's EP's and albums again before the concert (from ""The Orange Room"" all the way till ""Equals""), and if anything, the album fits more into his pre-debut stuff. It felt like the mature version of stuff from ""Want Some?"" and all those records. Especially with his honesty in lyrics and the band arrangements, which is sonically what he used to do quite a bit before ""Plus"" (and the original ""You Need Me"" before he rerecorded it to change it from band sound to just his acoustic guitar). 
* The original plan for the sound/production of ""Subtract"" was to be heavily inspired by Damien Rice's ""O"". That is exactly what this 2023 version of ""Subtract"" feels like to me. Both have intimate acoustic songs, just vocals and guitar, maybe some strings. Both have very personal lyrics. Both have very big, heavy sounding moments production-wise (see the latter half of ""I Remember"" for example, super unexpected if you go in thinking the whole album will sound like ""Delicate"" or ""The Blower's Daughter"".
* Some people's feelings that these songs don't feel like Ed, could be because we're kind of hearing unfiltered Ed for the first time ever, or at least in a long time. We're used to 'filtered/perfectionist Ed', who tries to make the best songs he can, but now we hear him just vomit lyrics that encapsulate exactly how he felt at the time, which actually gives us a look at the 'true' Ed. 

""Boat‚Äù
* Very Damien Rice-ish
* The closest to what Ed said the original Subtract was supposed to be (just acoustic guitar, strings, his voice)

‚ÄúSalt Water‚Äù
* I got a ""Cold Water"" by Damien Rice vibe from it, could be because of the similar names haha

‚ÄúEyes Closed‚Äù
* Ed cried, explained that the last time he saw Jamal was at the Eventim Apollo (the venue of the Subtract show), when they sat together beside the stage at a comedy show
* He actually ""messed up too many times"", so had to start again before he got to the first chorus
* Best version I have heard of this song, powerful vocals and great arrangement, with extra emotional Ed, the live string section made it even better

""Life Goes On‚Äù
* Really good, about Ed wanting the world to stop for Jamal like it did for queen Elizabeth II.

‚ÄúDusty‚Äù
* Cross between ""You Need To Cut Your Hair"" and ""Sandman"", sounds similar to the opening bit of Paul McCartney's ""Take It Away"" 
* Sweet as honey, really cute and the most light song on the album, which fits
* Ed would go to bed crying, then be woken up by a ""ball of joyous energy"" (Lyra) who just wanted to have some fun with daddy. Lyra would pick a vinyl record, then they would listen to it together while having breakfast. This song is about that:
* ""Drop the needle on Dusty"" (Springfield), referring to ""Dusty in Memphis"", which is the album they listened to the day he wrote this song. I had never listened to Springfield before, so I listened to this album on the train back home. Really nice, and I can imagine how  the second song on the record (""So Much Love"") made him feel, the lyrics seem to match his feelings that morning he listened to this LP with Lyra. 

‚ÄúEnd of Youth‚Äù
* ""We are brought into the world with open hands and hearts, but when darkness creeps in, that's the end of youth"" (if I remember correctly)
* About how your youth ends and you become an adult when someone close to you passes away, which can happen at any age.

‚ÄúColourblind‚Äù
* ""Let's paint the night colourblind""
* Beautiful lyrics

‚ÄúCurtains‚Äù
* Introduced it too early, played it anyway, so almost the album order haha
* Epic, maybe the biggest song in terms of arrangement with the band, but it fits
* Stadium potential
* About having someone to open the curtains and ""let the sunshine in"" when you are very depressed

‚ÄúBorderline‚Äù
* Insanely high vocals, very unexpected, but incredible 
* Also about Cherry's ""predicament""

‚ÄúSpark‚Äù
* Completely unrelated to the original ""Spark"" from his self-titled EP. I love both.
* Some great lyrics about hoping that some of the spark is left after you end something (reminiscing isn't always a great thing he said, can't remember the entire story he told)

‚ÄúVega‚Äù
* He literally said how interesting it was that ""Vega is the brightest star in the Lyrian system"", but it isn't about Lyra, it was about ""Cherry' predicament"" as he put it.
* Amazing lyrics, very poetic bits, even he didn't know what the following line even meant, it just came out of him that day: 
* ""It burns like hell to be Vega"" (or hurts?)

‚ÄúSycamore‚Äù
* Also really liked it
* I think he was kinda wondering what would be left of him and his loved ones after they're gone? Can't remember exactly, but I think that was the comparison with a Sycamore tree that just remains?

‚ÄúNo Strings‚Äù
* First reaction was ""No Strings"" &gt; ""Perfect, could be his greatest love song, more mature, could not have written this before last year (he explained that his parents told him the bond in marriage gets stronger when real illness and death happens, which makes the bond truly unbreakable, which it did for Ed and Cherry)
* He said this is one of his favourite songs he has ever written, understandably so

‚ÄúThe Hills of Aberfeldy‚Äù
* It is indeed the November 2012 song written with Foy Vance about being on holiday in Aberfeldy, thinking of a girl. Was always supposed to end the album, now he wanted it to ease the listener toward the end of the record, not end it on a sad note, but more calm

It's time to announce the results of the GTA V Non-Stop Pop [r/mashups](https://www.reddit.com/r/mashups/) contest.

The use of modes and certain classics made for its own unique challenge. From listening to the entries, all have something to work on but many had some potential with a few strong ideas. Smalltown Boy (not a bonus track), West End Girls, and Pure Shores were common tracks used.

Tracks are not linked publicly at this time because the album project was restarted and is still ongoing. There were worries the album would be permanently cancelled, but once the organizers reached out to new management to help out and keep the project on track, it's much more likely the album will finish.

If you're still interested in the album, let me know and I can give you any info on submitting to it and any feedback as needed. Please continue to hold out on public track releases at this time if planning to submit. The target release date will be sometime in September to coincide with the anniversary of the GTA V game release.

While the Grammys haven't favored BTS in the past, Seven's achievements have been exceptional.

8097,"Hi guys, I created a visual novel for celebrating the release of Layover. I really like Rainy Days in this album so this game is about that you sneak around tae on every rainy days. But you already have a boyfriend Woo Yunho!  
Yessss, I really want tae to be a secret lover lol   
Here's some part of the visual novel ‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è

  
You hate rainy days, and you hate getting wet. These feelings became even more pronounced after your breakup with Kim Taehyung. He knew you disliked the rain, so he'd come over to your apartment on every rainy day to keep you company indoors, and you would have sex continuously. He jokingly said it was to make sure your moans drowned out the sound of the rain, so you wouldn't realize it was raining outside.  
After you broke up, you pitifully felt like Pavlov's dog - every time it rained, you would think of Kim Taehyung. Each raindrop was like a mirror reflecting your lust-filled face during your passionate nights together.  
""Damn‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"" You felt very irritable.  
It rained continuously in Seoul for several days. You stayed holed up in your company's studio, but eventually your current boyfriend Woo Yunho's incessant texts and calls wore you down. He was eager to see you.  
""....If he really wanted to see me so badly, why doesn't he just come to my studio?"" You whisper to yourself.  
The damp, oppressive heat mixing with the earthy concrete smelled stale. An uncomfortable tightness grew in your chest and you felt like you was suffocating.  
**Option 1: Call** **Woo Yunho**  
**Option 2: Keep waiting**

9450,"I follow an organization called Everytown (a non-profit fighting against gun violence) on twitter, and I just found out Harry Styles is their biggest celebrity partner and[just donated 1 million $](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/harry-styles-everytown-for-gun-safety) from his tour to them, plus an [extra 100,000 when he was in Texas](https://www.kvue.com/article/news/local/everytown-donation-harry-styles-austin-moody/269-99a14f38-cbdf-466e-a2a1-55177977ce05) after the Uvalde shooting.  at least this makes his whole Treat People With Kindness thing a little less corny (not completely tho).

Anyways, this plus that thing where he [registered \~54,000 people](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/harry-styles-helped-register-new-voters-1234621494/) who attended concerts in the US to vote, I'm kinda surprised about how active he is in USA-specific social justice?

(also, he's apparently been on tour for a billion years.  Like wtf?)

**tldr**; is usual for non-US celebs to be so active in US-centric non-profits/charities? I feel weird for questioning a net-good like this but I can't help it.

5868,"so first of all he looks great but what i came here to say is:

harry styles doesn't exist to be attractive to you or anyone - NO human being exists to be attractive. i don't understand the mindset that some people have where they feel like they have the right to be disappointed or whatever when another human being's appearance changes

he's not an object to look at, he's a real person. if he wanted to tattoo a dick and balls on his forehead (lmaoüò≠) he can, he's a grown adult, it's no one else's business but his

not to make this too serious but it honestly upsets me to think what would happen if, for an example, his body drastically changed, if he went through a medical issue or had his appearance change in any other way that wouldn't ""please"" people. or if that would happen to any other celebrity that gets objectified in this way

to be honest, it already happens with so many celebrities - especially women - who are aging. it happens with so many celebrities who gain weight or muscle or start balding or get acne or go through plastic surgery etc. people talk about them like they are objects to look at, and discuss what they should or shouldn't look like

it is such a self-centered mindset, and i think it's dangerous

the reason i'm talking about this is not because i think this harry styles buzzcut situation alone is super serious. i'm talking about this and i want everyone to talk about this because i think this is an example of a large issue

it's sometimes hard to have a ""pity party"" for celebrities because they hold so much power and money that it can feel unimportant to focus on things like this so much BUT i think this whole mindset i've described bleeds into real life and social media everywhere and i think it's genuinely harmful and dangerous for a LOT of people (not just celebrities)

also: i'm so happy to see that there are a lot of positive comments out there as well and i've seen other people talking about this too! i think this is a really important conversation related to celebrity and social media culture and i wanted to bring it here

also also: yes you are allowed to feel one way or another about someone else's appearance. but there is a BIG difference between thinking ""i don't like how they look"" AND saying it aloud AND ESPECIALLY posting it online where MILLIONS of people can see what you've said. i think talking about harry's hair or whatever is honestly way less harmful if you do it with your friends, instead of commenting about it online

but what do you guys think?",https://www.reddit.com/r/harrystyles/comments/17yggym/about_the_negativity_around_his_haircut/,about the negativity around his haircut,harrystyles,t3_17yggym,/r/harrystyles/comments/17yggym/about_the_negativity_around_his_haircut/,2023-11-18 21:25:34,Harry Styles

Yoongi mentions in a recent interview how fans have waited for a tour for a long time and that just reminded me of what could have been the MOTS tour. 

I still remember when the MOTS tour was first announced. I was so so excited. And so ready to see them üò≠üò≠üò≠. It was going to be an insane tour with the announced dates being 16 US stadium dates, 7 European dates (when BH remembered europe lol), 12 japan dome dates (and that was pre dynamite) and 4 Korean dates. As well as that mystery ? Dates around their anniversary üò≠üò≠ and that‚Äôs just what was announced they‚Äôd probs have added on SEA, South America, Australia. We know they were gonna add india which would have been so so amazing for Indian ARMYs, + their finale dates in Korea. God it would have been insane. 

I also remember it being said their production team for their stage was the people who worked with Beyonc√© for her stage production üò≠üò≠ like I wish we could have gotten to see how insane the stage production would have been. Especially for the songs like ON and Black Swan which we got a taste off through PTD on stage. But would have loved to see all the MOTS solos live like can you imagine, persona, ego, shadow, filter, my time, inner child, moon. üò≠. Hopefully yoongi adds shadow to his tour set list üëÄ. 

and the last thing that I remember is that the stage was the shape of a 7. A FCKIN SEVEN. LIKE imagine them performing WE ARE BULLERPROOF: THE ETERNAL on a seven shaped stage while I ball my eyes out üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠.

I highly doubt that two will happen performing at the Super Bowl, they both have good fanbases. 

What good things that can come out is that they both put on a good show performance some of their songs.

From a Financial standpoint, Drake is bringing in relatively similar gross figures per show to Beyonc√©‚Äôs stadium tour.

Will they bring in the same gross total by the end of their respective tours? No. But at the end of the day Drake is still able to charge premium prices for Tickets while not sacrificing his performance and artistic integrity just to say he is doing stadium.

15538,"Ok, so, first time ever making a post because I've serached everywhere and can't seem to find any specific answer ... 

I've purchased the JPFC membership last year (On Weverse Shop) and with all the photocard events that have (and maybe will) come up this time I decided to try and purchase V's LayoVer album directly for a chance to win that photocard. 

The JPFC is correctly linked to the membership - all good until I decided to actually BUY something.

Decided to try [tenso.com](https://tenso.com) as a forwarding service, added the address, confirmed with them, all good. Silly me that I thought there would be zero issues with my payment cards. I tried every single one of them and NONE went through. 

I would just like to know if someone has purchased albums from there and if there's any ""secret"" for using the credit cards. I've tried my physical cards (credit and debit), Revolut, Wise - nothing :( 

I also put the info that the ""Billing address is different from the shipping address"" - put my own address. Nada. Put ""Same address"". Again, nothing. Eventually gave up.

I know there's always the option to try and find someone there that can go to a convenience store and make the payment, but I would like to do the payment myself or some reliable proxy that would do that service (with a cost ofc) - given that the order would have to be made with my account. 

Sorry for the rant and maybe I didn't search deep enough but I couldn't find that much info about this kind of issue....

I told my wife I only bought lawn seats so she's in for a treat when she realizes we are going into the pit. Also...what is the pit like? Is it crowded, does it vary on location? I'll be in Tampa.

8494,"Hey everyone, I‚Äôve got a theory to share. Remember those Spotify billboards, posts, and the cover of the reggaeton playlist? All the content related to ‚ÄúNadie Sabe‚Äù coming from Spotify is predominantly white or beige with black text. It seems to match the album cover‚Äôs beige color and its simple yet artistic style. Now, when we shift our attention to Apple Music promotions, it‚Äôs a completely different story. They use bold red with black, and the presence of the Rolls Royce is consistent in every promo. This creates a more intense and aggressive vibe compared to the calm and minimalistic look of the Spotify promos.

So, here‚Äôs my theory: this contrast in promotions is a nod to the two different styles within the album, Bad Bunny and Benito. The beige-colored album cover and the simple white and black aesthetics on Spotify represent Benito, symbolizing those 11 tracks in the newer style. On the other hand, the bold black and red aesthetic with the Rolls Royce exudes an exuberant vibe, reminiscent of the old Bad Bunny, which we can expect in the other 11 tracks.

9543,"Hi all! I wanted to share my Good Morning America experience as a general admission ticket holder from last Friday because I don‚Äôt see others talking about it. 

TLDR: probably half of ticketed fans actually got to see it after delays and eventual cancellation of the show

Fans were told by GMA that the performance would be held rain or shine, even with the predicted thunderstorms. Seemed to be delays and slow bag check because at 7:30am (show is supposed to start at 7am), I was still waiting in line. From my spot in line, we could hear soundcheck and it sounded like the actual performance (JK singing every lyric really well and even the GMA announcers saying things), but GMA security and officials said nothing to us. 

At close to 7:45am, the security suddenly told us to evacuate because of lightning risk and that there would be no performance. I was very close to bag check and about the halfway mark in the line, meaning half of the fans lined up didn‚Äôt get in. The ‚Äúsoundcheck‚Äù I heard from line was aired as the actual performance.

9753,"It recently came out that on the 9th of July, they're releasing a [book](https://twitter.com/PopBase/status/1656775798563704832) about their journey as artists. Are there any specific topics or sections of the book you're looking forward to?  Personally I wanna read about 2018, and why they almost broke up, but then decided to stay together, especially when I look at how some of the members have talked about that period of time. I feel like it's really gonna be a rollercoaster. What about you guys, what're you looking forward to?

edit just to add: I'm aware that the book likely isn't going to be fuck the company, fuck the government, fuck everyone, and is likely going to focus on their own ups and downs, and that's mainly what I was referring to. I cannot imagine the media shit storm that would follow if they were extremely frank about the negative external forces which have been at play the last few years.

9825,"I'm a huge BTS fan and have followed and supported all their solo endeavours closely, so when Seven was announced and released I was super excited. Although the tempo of the song was a bit too fast for my personal taste, I still enjoyed the track. The MV was super fun and the explicit version was a fun surprise as well. So overall, I really enjoyed the debut and have been supporting it as well.

But the industry push (e.g., more promotion in the West, Western artists promoting the song) behind the song has sort of left a bad taste in my mouth. It's just so interesting (annoying) that the one song being embraced by the Western music industry is the song with almost no behind-the-scenes involvement from the Korean side. The news about Jungkook releasing a full English album has not made me feel any better about this and brings up a number of concerns for me.

One of them is related to BTS' future. HYBE is currently doing a lot of pandering to the West, which seems in direct contradiction to what BTS have said about their music previously. Instead of having more freedom with their music, I feel like they will have less - especially with recent releases following the trend of short songs. Following the success of Seven, I fear that future singles by BTS will more than likely be full English and generic pop tracks more often than not. I don't understand why HYBE is not treating BTS like the established artists they are, that does not need to follow trends and pander to the West.

Another concern I have is in relation to the motive from the West, with regard to all their involvement (I presume) in Jungkook's debut album. Of course they see this as an opportunity to make a lot of money from the BTS brand, but they may also see this as an opportunity to drive a wedge within the band because taking down / chewing up an artist for all their worth then dropping them is much easier with a solo artist with major involvement from them than a group unit with established coordination from their home base.

I'm still supporting the solo effort, and trying to maintain my trust in Jungkook, the group, and ARMY, but it has left me in a space where I can't purely enjoy the song anymore, and I'm also avoiding discussions related to it on social media. I hope once the hype dies down I can actually revisit the song and enjoy it the way I did before this Western hype/push.",https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/152tl1j/conflicted_feelings_about_jungkooks_solo_debut/,Conflicted feelings about Jungkook's solo debut and future,kpopthoughts,t3_152tl1j,/r/kpopthoughts/comments/152tl1j/conflicted_feelings_about_jungkooks_solo_debut/,2023-07-18 09:29:03,BTS

9452,"I follow a few Spanish gossip blogs, and it amazes me how different they are from American gossip blogs. 

A few months ago (at some point last year) Bad Bunny went live and said Gabriela was his best friend, they weren‚Äôt together. At the time, I had plenty of reasons to believe they were poly or open and he was just trying to get attention off of her so she could live her life/in case either of them were seen with other people. Regardless, they were together for years and posted each other. I wonder now if they actually had broken up then but were still casually seeing each other.

I‚Äôm blown away by how easily people accepted what he said in the live and basically forgot Gabriela lol. None of the blogs I‚Äôve seen have really questioned it, and after that I have barely seen her name at all. A few places DID post about the tattoo he has on his forearm after the grammy‚Äôs (looks like Gabriela‚Äôs eyes‚Ä¶.Ojitos Lindos üëÄ). American blogs still mention exes from years ago with other celebs, and people do these insane deep dives into blinds, posts, etc. and it‚Äôs so interesting to see the difference with Bad Bunny.

Anyway, now that he‚Äôs supposedly dating Kendall Jenner, I‚Äôm curious what everyone else thinks about it all. I think the timing of their ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù getting leaked was interesting, considering he did James Cordon, the Hispanic community hates her, and he was just on the first all Spanish Time cover.

9773,"BTS came from a small company, they started with nothing. Jin who was casted just because of his looks, Suga who left his family and gambled his education just to do what he really wanted to be, Namjoon who was never have been supported by his parents, Jimin who thought himself as ugly and fat, Taehyung whose always been part of BTS but was never shown in any promotions- not until they debut, Hoseok who seemed to always laugh but never felt as an accomplishment to his father, And Jungkook who was very shy and have saved his parents at a young age by auditioning to companies. Remember the days when they were struggling? They even have to sacrifice and work hard just so they could eat? They were squeezing themselves into one small apartment and have to take responsibilities- the reason why they wrote the song 'Move'. Those times when Jimin has to starve himself just because people calls him fat and ugly. That one interview where Yoongi said that; it was nice that people listens to their music because Taehyung and Jungkook are good looking. And he thought that it was at least enough. Do you remember when Hoseok was supposed to be the vocalist and Taehyung is the rapper, but he chose to rap instead and learn it because Taehyung wants to be a Vocalist. It was Taehyung's dream and Hoseok loves his dongsaeng that much he would sacrifice. Other fan base were accusing them for plagiarism just because they had the smallest detail whose the same with other big K-pop group which is actually just a coincidence. There was a time when Yoongi packed 300 gifts and letters just to give to their 300 fans who will attend at their mini fan meetings. So why do people judge them so quickly? Did you know that Jimin came all the way to Seoul from Busan just to persuade his dreams? Did you know that Taehyung lived with his grandma gor almost half of his life making him innocent from what else is out there in our world? Did you know that Jungkook set aside his embarrassment just to meet the others expectations? Yes, he is the golden maknae, but he suffers too when he see his hyungs having a hard time, he cries. And there was a time when Jimin caught him crying and the reason is because he misses his family. Jungkook often cry secretly so that his hyungs wouldn't worry. Did you know that Jin auditioned to make his mother proud of him and so that his mom would have something to brag off to those judgmental neighbors they have. He worked hard on his vocals yet people called him talentless. Did you know that Namjoon worked hard just to produce songs yet there was a time when his mom ruined his computer and broke his mike so he could focus on studying? Did you know that Hoseok auditioned because he wanted his father to be proud of him? Because he felt like he was a disappointment? Those rookie days where they only listen to the awardings and be amazed by their seniors. They can't do anything but to watch those idols who receives the awards. The days when they were happy with just 300 views on YouTube, mini fangatherings, small numbers of followers, and one Daesang award. They were contented. And now they've reached to the top and became more successful. From 150 fans to 16M and counting, From a small practice room to a bigger one, From cramped dorm with roommates to big dorm with each of them having a room, From one daesang award to more awards and they've even won on BBMAs.

**Bullet points**

1. This is Ed's first standard album since + to feature explicit tracks: **Plastic Bag**, **That's On Me** and **The Day I Was Born**

2. This is Ed's first standard album where every song is co-written. 

3. This is Ed's first album featuring only 1 producer. (Eyes Closed, unlike the rest of Subtract, had production/writing credits of Max Martin, Shellback and Fred Again)

4. As per the Rolling Stone article, **Magical** has Bruce Springsteen influences while **England** is an airy ballad that has a **Solsbury Hill** feel.

5. Aaron Dessner describes the album as a ""wilder, eccentric autumnal cousin"" to Subtract. (which kinda ties into what Ed said about this being a ""happier album"".

I don't know what it is with Drake, he can always do more but he does the minimum. This album is full of lazy bars, boring flows, trap beats, no instrumentation or musically range.

15034,"(ENGLISH IS NOTTT MY FIRST LENGUAGE, SORRY IN ADVANCE)

I, a high schooler, have many friends, all of them in different classrooms, so we only meet during recess and the 5-minute break we have between every hour. I could say I have two groups of friends, one, I talk with most, and the second one, we have been friends for 4 years.

  
I'm much closer to my first group of friends, I sometimes go to the movies or for ice cream after school with them, if our schedule makes it possible ofc, and since my two groups of friends aren't friends with each other, I don't have the chance to invite the other one with us, since it'd be awkward, so I send them a message instead ''hey I'm (I'll be) at x place if you want to come! I'll invite you!'' (I'll pay for them). I have also asked them many times physically, they say no. Or If in a message, ignore me. 

  
I'll admit I'm a very introverted, and not a very talkative person, and don't like when people touch me, my second friend group is filled to the brim with very extroverted bubbly, and friendly people, I don't know, that's probably relevant. They also frequently ignore my messages LMAO.

  
To the matter, I was walking out of school, In the distance, I saw my friends, walking out of the ice cream store, without me, you see I told one of them that I was free at x and that I would be at school doing nothing for another hour after that, maybe they didn't listen, or weren't paying attention. They could have easily invited me like I always do. It hurt, if felt like I just witnessed a crime scene, it probably wasn't a big deal.  
I am overthinking, they were together and one of them probably said ''let's get some ice cream'' and didn't think about it too much.

  
There are also other cases where they weirdly exclude me or ignore me, I try and talk to them.. the thing is, they try too, they hug me hello and goodbye, and yesterday one of those friends called me in the middle of my class to see if I was free! 

  
This is not a big deal, but for me, it is, I am a very hormonal teenager after all, They probably just messed up didn't they? Am I taking this too hard? What should I do?? How about the constant ignoring of my messages? 

  
I already confronted them, a very dry exchange, over the message, at the end I said, ''When I invite you guys, you don't go'', one of them said ''No you don't invite us'' (I LITERALLY DO, I ALSO HAVE PROOF AND WITNESSES LMAO) ''I always send a message saying that I'm at the ice cream store and you can come but you leave me on read'', seen, then they change the topic, this made me so MAD. There are so many other minor things that put me off, I mean just the fact that they Ignore me so much through messenger. This has been going on for 3 years, the ignoring me, and I haven't complained, my bad..

Like truly, this is the littlest thing in the world, but it makes me feel SOO sad like no way

9704,"disclaimer: i am NOT hating on the other idols i would mention. i believe these groups deserve the push they get, same things bts members as solo artists should also get. 

it's so tiring to see the fandom get sucked dry and expect the fans to hard carry streams and sales but they don't even bother with playlisting (and maybe even ads) which helps with longevity and to reach a wider audience.

set me free pt 2 isn't even on Kpop On while newjeans have 3 songs in it and lessera has 2. NONE of the songs from face is on this is bts playlist yet, not even smf and it's almost _two_ weeks now. 

for years, i've seen armys blame columbia records for the lack of playlisting but when they left and signed with umg, nothing happened. then, newjeans, a rookie, gets playlisted, even le ssera's yunjin got her unpromoted song on kpop on. bh who _never_ uses ads for bts except for run bts dance challenge gave txt ads on youtube and tiktok.

**some** armys will claim that playlists, radio spins and ads aren't organic but same fans looping the same songs aren't too. bts as soloist aren't bts, the group. their solos will always be anticipated but to reach wider audience outside the fandom and the kpop bubble, the members need push too. 

bts' sns team and the ones who handle their spotify and yt accounts are all over the place. from the lack of tweets about some members' solo gigs/achievements, and as recent as last year, there were times english subs were late,, to their spotify taking WEEKS before some songs get added to the main bts playlist, happened to vibe and happening to smf. you'll think these things are as basic as it gets, but yeah this is happening to the biggest kpop group from one of the biggest kpop companies to ever exists.

jimin just achieved one of the biggest streams in kpop and bh couldn't afford 2 spots on kpop on, not a single spot on tth and other playlists like new music in different platforms, like apple music is so insulting to how big bts is, how massive their streams are, how well they sell, and how long bts had been single-handedly carried that company on their backs.

and don't tell me the members have to ask the company first or maybe the members don't want this, who the fuck doesn't want their music to get promo? and WHY, just why do the members have to ask for promo when they built that company from the ground so things like playlisting, competent sns team should've been given.

i feel like i'm gonna get downvoted to hell but i DO appreciate the things bh does right. i'm not an ""anti"" but i needed to get this out of my chest.

edit: i think armys as a fandom need to discuss about bts being against playlisting or not playing with spotify's ""dirty"" game. when they have group songs that had great playlisting AND solo songs that are literally on tth (on the street for 2 weeks) you cannot say bts doesn't want it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/124uae3/its_frustrating_how_bhhybe_never_bothers_to/,it's frustrating how bh/hybe never bothers to playlist any of bts solos no matter how many streams they get,kpopthoughts,t3_124uae3,/r/kpopthoughts/comments/124uae3/its_frustrating_how_bhhybe_never_bothers_to/,2023-03-28 16:26:48,BTS

9758,"First things first: this is a discussion about title tracks. If you think Run BTS was a better track from a musical perspective, I have no desire to argue with you. 

The opinion that Run BTS would have made for a better title track for Proof, over the actual title track, Yet To Come, is one I‚Äôve seen several times over the past months. It seems like many ARMYs hold this sentiment - Run BTS was more popular, we/I preferred Run BTS, therefore it‚Äôs the better choice. I respectfully disagree. 

Yet To Come makes sense as a title track because it accomplishes so much in just one song. Proof is an anthology album that celebrates BTS‚Äôs past releases and closes the door on chapter one of their careers, and Yet To Come celebrates BTS‚Äôs pasts by visually referencing BTS eras in the music video and lyrically promising that ‚Äúthe best is yet to come.‚Äù The song says ‚Äúwait for us, because there are great things to come‚Äù (not an actual lyric). 

I‚Äôve also seen some claims that BTS made a mistake in making Yet To Come a ballad. Whilst I have my own opinions on the ballad genre, I think BTS have reached a stage where they are no longer held by the whims of the general public. I don‚Äôt think they need to write to cater to a specific demographic anymore. If they want to write a ballad, a trot song, folk music, hiphop, etc. I think they have every right to make music for the sake of making music.",https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/13oz1cs/yet_to_come_was_a_good_title_track_and_im_tired/,Yet To Come was a good title track and I‚Äôm tired of people pushing Run BTS as the superior option,kpopthoughts,t3_13oz1cs,/r/kpopthoughts/comments/13oz1cs/yet_to_come_was_a_good_title_track_and_im_tired/,2023-05-22 18:32:15,BTS

Like maybe play more from AUSTIN and even TCT I‚Äôm sure some fans who haven‚Äôt been to his previous tours  are bloody stoked with the setlists but I think we can lose some of these hits and play some deepcuts or even like cooped up and enough is enough.

Listened to 8am in Charlotte like 5 times and realized something‚Ä¶ Drake has been sounding the same for 10 years‚ùóÔ∏è Yeah it‚Äôs god, Drake is great but when is comes to Aubrey‚Ä¶I look at him like APPLE, JORDANS shoes.

What I mean by that as we get the SAME product over and over again and the media and fans eat it up.

Why Ye my favorite artist is every album rollout, every time period was like a movie. An experience. It‚Äôs always different and Ye is always trying out new sounds and taking risks.

‚Äú8am in Charlotte‚Äù could definitely pass for a song on CLB, Her loss, maybe scorpion.

For Ye, based on the song we hear, we can easily distinguish if it was DONDA, Dark Fantasy, YEEZUS, JIK, 808‚Äôs, etc

Our beloved u/chesari \- who serves as our Book Club facilitator - has some family obligations this weekend, so I‚Äôll be pinch-hitting for her this week.

This week we'll be discussing chapter 5 (focusing on the Love Yourself Era) of our seven favorite guys' new band biography, Beyond The Story: 10-Year Record of BTS. Comments below will include spoilers through the end of chapter 5! So if you don't want to be spoiled, please wait until you've finished the chapter before reading the comments.

If anyone has read ahead and wants to comment something related to future chapters, two things: 1) use spoiler tags to protect anything you say that might spoil the content of chapters 5 and beyond for others, and 2) your comment should also be related to the chapter we're currently discussing, not just a future chapter.

Here are a few questions as food for thought:

‚Ä¢	Was there anything in this chapter that you found surprising?

‚Ä¢	If you were to sum up this chapter with one word, what word would you choose and why?

‚Ä¢	What part of this chapter had the most emotional impact for you?

13123,"Before I start, I want to add context that I‚Äôm a drake fan. Like most, I undersell my fandom to others. First Drake song I remember hearing was his A Milli freestyle on YouTube (good times). I purchased Thank Me Later the day it came out at a Best Buy in Atlanta. Numerous concerts attended before the price tag became astronomical.

With that said, I have some feedback for Drake. I think after the air clears after his release for FATD, he needs to do two things:

1. Immerse himself in one genre (hip-hop, R&B, soul, pop, Dance, etc.). Whatever he decides is up to him but focusing on one will give him clear direction into a new challenge to overcome.

2. AVOID promotion of his next career project at all costs. Drake is super talented and very calculated. I would like to see those skills combined with an element on surprise. I truly believe this step is what took Beyonc√© into an ethereal position within music and culture after she dropped her self titled album. The current cycle in the most simplified terms is ‚ÄúDrake gives us notice when he will deliver, and then he delivers when that time arrives‚Äù. While this in itself is an extremely hard skill to master, I think it‚Äôs clear he‚Äôs right there in terms of the best with this planned, external approach. In order for him to keep core fans on their toes and bring in the outside, he needs to create a ‚Äúbang‚Äù within this current system of music and I think one of the only ways to do that at this phase for him is to hone in on the element of surprise.

Since DLDT, I feel like I‚Äôve been on a Drake loop of receiving an album but only being able to live long with select songs. To be clear, I still think this is a huge success because no one else in these genres is making anything I can feel these days. I‚Äôm just saying, there‚Äôs another level he can get to and as a long time supporter, I would like to witness it. 

Comments are welcome. Let‚Äôs discuss",https://www.reddit.com/r/Drizzy/comments/16wn9fe/honest_feedback_for_aubrey/,Honest feedback for Aubrey,Drizzy,t3_16wn9fe,/r/Drizzy/comments/16wn9fe/honest_feedback_for_aubrey/,2023-10-01 00:52:51,Drake

Basically, you'll be presented with two of his albums and then just click which one is better. This will increase/decrease each album's ""score,"" and once a lot of people play it, there will be a ranking of Drake albums that reflects his fans. 

This also lets you create your own personal ranking, which becomes more accurate the longer you play.

6162,"Hello.

I am a huge fan of Ed Sheeran. I decided to review his tracks 1 by 1. While Eyes Closed was the first track, I'm going to do it based off track list so I'll begin with Boat. Please note this is my opinion, you are welcome to share yours! Please respect mine, as I will respect yours. Thanks!

""Boat"" is the title track off Ed's fifth and final installment of the mathematics series of albums, *Subtract*. The track is a stark contrast musically and lyrically to his previous album opener, ""Tides"" from *Equals.* With ""Tides"" opening with roaring drums and upbeat melody, ""Boat"" throws you immediately into Ed's current state of mind - with a single guitar strum. Truly confirming the statement that *Subtract* is a ""trapdoor"" into the mind of Ed Sheeran.

""Boat"" is a beautiful, yet haunting ballad about the struggles of depression and overcoming consistent challenges through resilience. 'The waves won't break my boat' have Ed relating waves to problems in life that are constantly thrashing and crashing into an individual (represented by the boat.) It is a beautiful representation of struggles we face as individuals that can arise out of no where. Rough waves are relentless, unpredictable, and will continue to crash into you even when you have fallen down. It is a beautiful way to express turbulence in life.

The production by Aaron Dessner gives the song an ""authentic Ed Sheeran"" feel by allowing Ed's signature instrument, the guitar, to take the spotlight and lead the melody. Combining this instrumental with Dessner's famous atmospheric strings and pad production, the dynamics of the song are best described as beautifully minimal.

Overall, the song ""Boat"" is a wonderful introduction into the album *Subtract* and perfectly finds that balance between the old Ed Sheeran and the new Ed Sheeran styles. I think this song is going to hit those who have felt turbulence in their life very hard. It may not resonate at all with those who haven't felt that turbulence.

&#x200B;

My favorite aspect about this track: The similar effect used in ""Tides"" where the music cuts out for a slow, haunting chorus. ""The waves won't break my boat."" Makes you, as the listener, feel ""frozen in time"". This is even better paired with the music video when the waves are in slow motion hitting Ed during the chorus. It reminds me of, even when the worst is happening, by reassuring yourself that you will overcome challenges, it temporarily mutes their impact.

My least favorite aspect about this track: It sort of feels like Ed held back vocally at the outro when he should've belted the one unique ""The waves won't break my boat"" dynamic into the riff.

All the sudden he‚Äôs a shitty person and performer and y‚Äôall don‚Äôt want the album anymore? Are y‚Äôall stupid? Y'all we‚Äôre shitting on him for not dropping the album exactly 2 weeks he first talked about dropping. Y‚Äôall were just shitting on him for not dropping the album on August 25th even tho that date was never confirmed. Y‚Äôall shit on him so much he had to address y‚Äôall at a show and say he never said it was dropping so y‚Äôall would get off his ass. Pause. Then he gives a date for the 22nd and y‚Äôall shit on him for having to wait a few more weeks. Then he pushes the album back so he doesn‚Äôt have to cancel shows and y‚Äôall shit on him for making y‚Äôall wait. Now he‚Äôs postponing shows to give y‚Äôall the album and y‚Äôall are shitting on him for dropping the album. Wtf do y‚Äôall want? He doesn‚Äôt care about his fans? No his fans suck. Y‚Äôall suck. At least with other fanbases like Carti, Travis, Kanye etc. they still support the artist no matter what. How many times has Kanye pushed an album back or flat out lied and never released? How many times has he said and done terrible unforgivable things? How many times has Carti done his fans wrong? How long has he made his fans wait while never addressing them? What if Drake let his fans die in the crowd and still kept performing. What if he made y‚Äôall wait 5 years for another release? Y‚Äôall have no perspective on how great and consistent Drake really is. He hasn‚Äôt done anything as bad as his contemporaries yet y‚Äôall still shit on him every chance you get.

""I was born to raise hell,
I was born to take pills...
...
I was born to fuck up,
I was born, what a shame""

9425,"(Some) people cry and act like they are going to disband/disappear, when really they will be back eventually. The time to serve in the military has decreased from 30 months to 21-18 months too so that's good.

I admit. If they disbanded, I would also become really sad, but 2 years pass by quick, especially to us adult ARMYS who are busy w adulting....  

Some members will be back before, such as Jin and J-hope who will give us content to look into and support (especially Jin, he needs more solo content/may even do acting which I'd love to see. I think he has the least fans/attention so that's awesome for him ‚ú®).

BTS in my opinion have also reached their peak already.... It's sad, but they have left us w so much content to catch up on in many ways... They themselves have also expressed they WANT to serve for their country, and have overall been a strong group for 10+ years already... 

Their music has changed, so I doubt they will be able to release songs w lyrics about youth such as ""No More Dream,"" ""Young Singer,"" or ""War or Hormone"" in the year 2025, when K-pop has changed, and most of the members will now be in their 30s...

They r no longer young boys who are interested in girls, or singing about breaking away from what society wants them to be as adults... I actually have no idea what they will sing about now too, lol... 

Military or not, BTS are growing up, and will eventually marry and probably have no idea what to sing about now either, compared to what they wanted to sing  when they had started w exitement of their group....

* Would you rather have BTS *finally* perform Paradise or Louder Than Bombs?
* Would you rather go for a bicycle ride on a super hot and humid day with Namjoon or have a 3 hour gym session with Jungkook where he goes all out?
* Would you rather metal concept Bangtan or country concept Bangtan?
* Would you rather have a sneak peak into the Genius Lab and listen to unreleased songs or have a sneak peak at Hopefilm and see pictures from over the years?

Jungkook is not very liked anymore in kpop spaces such as twt or tiktok so i deleted my twt cause of all the vile hate he would get i would barely see anything positive about him there.. also deleted my kpop tiktok account and made a new one. 

I think I've detached myself from him and kpop now i find him a bit cringe not as good looking as before and i feel bad about it.. but when i hear my coworkers mention him i still act like a fan and i get happy when i hear his songs in public and sometimes when I'm bored i look him up on tiktok to see what he's been up to.. 

I'm thinking about stanning a western artist cause they don't get as much hate but i just can't fo it for some reason it's not the same.. I also feel kind of dumb for stanning someone in a group i know jk loves his members and won't ever leave bts and it makes me sad because i wish he would just leave kpop and make silly pop music so that mean bts and kpop stans leave him alone but it's obvious he doesn't want that..

9778,"*I'm prepared to be downvoted to hell but oh well. I hope the admins allow this to be posted. I just want to address my fellow ARMYs because twitter won't work.*

This isn't a post for haters of BTS to spread even more hate for the boys or the fandom. I want to address ARMYs and ARMYs alone. Perhaps majority of the sub's members are ARMYs too, hence I hope this isn't taken too negatively. I know many of you would disagree. Afterall, many people know that ARMYs are one of the main reasons why BTS has achieved what they have now. And that the toxic side of the fandom isn't something exclusive but is widespread in the kpop industry as a whole. Surely, the toxicity of ARMYs, which some don't admit to, is just the norm. Some ARMYs might even say it's not toxicity when it's only looking out for BTS.

Even I myself would disagree had my younger self be the one reading that title. But with BTS now in hiatus, the fandom's attitude has become more and more unbearable for me.

We all know the underdog story of BTS and why ARMY is so protective of them.

For a few years, show hosts would mistreat them on variety shows, cut them off from broadcast, and at one point a fandom accused them of something they had to be sent to court over. All because BTS had shown potential to overtake their faves. Eventually, they did surpass them. 

Even now when they're at the top, they still face racism, xenophobia, and unwarranted hate overall. The difference is that they are now above those opinions. They have become the gods of Kpop. They now have ARMYs behind them.

At the time of me joining the fandom, the fanwars were at an all time high. BTS just got their first daesang, and with it, the largest surge of hate towards them.

See, I understand ARMYs. I understand that they want the best for the boys. I myself have once been active in engaging with such fandom wars. Because BTS did deserve their success. 

BTS paved the way is practically every ARMYs motto. And they did. But what's sad is that ARMYS treat that path that BTS paved for, as something that *solely* belongs to BTS.

Anyone who tries, or even just dream, of walking the same path, is mocked and looked down upon.

*How dare you think you're as good as BTS? You'll never reach their level. Delusional pieces of cr/p* ‚Äî Familiar?

Ironically the same words from the bigger fandoms from before BTS took over Kpop by storm.

As someone who is still supportive of the boy's endeavors, I too, don't believe anyone can achieve what BTS did. At least not in the next few years. Which brings me to my next point.

Isn't the purpose of BTS in paving the way, for more music from the kpop industry to be introduced to a wider audience? Isn't that what we have prided ourselves for? That BTS, the underdogs, managed to overcome the adversaries and became pioneers of kpop in the global field?

What was once mocked is now slowly becoming mainstream in the west. And BTS, is there at the forefront.

Typically, when an artist paves the way, the path that they walked would then be followed by the youngsters who look up to them. They don't even dream of surpassing their seniors. They are simply treading the path BTS have worked hard to widen. 

Oftentimes, after becoming familiar with BTS, more people would branch out to discover other groups. Music has that effect on you, it makes you curious of other things that might be in store.

But everytime a reactor would react to BTS then eventually try to discover other groups, they would be accused of using BTS for clout. (Most reactors are trash though so just don't watch them. It's a waste of time).

And of course, the reason why I decided to post this: When young boys who can be considered BTS' younger brothers dared dream to achieve a placement in the hot 100, they are mocked left and right for simply having aspirations. The man, Bang PD (although I don't like him that much either), who had been with BTS since the start and have encouraged them, is now being accused of abandoning BTS to focus on his favorite.

A company that spent millions of dollars for a 10th year anniversary celebration that ARMYs could enjoy for free would never do that for a group they didn't care about. 

I hope ARMYs know that even BTS would be happy to see their juniors achieve what they did. They have already made their mark, and no one can take that away from them. 

Records are meant to be surpassed, and music is meant to be consumed without malice. It is not a competition, nor a challenge of gatekeeping certain achievements. Don't forget what BTS has been saying all those years. 

Don't be the very people who didn't believe in them who had nothing.


Ps. To address the issue of Jimin not being congratulated by the company when he got his #1 and the seemingly shady way a weverse article had downplayed his achievement (Agust D as well, but only Jimin's issue is being used in the fandom wars right now so I thought I'd remind you): I also believe that was done in poor taste. It is perfectly okay to criticize the action of that author or even Bang PD if you will. But to attack TXT (or any groups actually) for the wrong action made by other people is just proving the point of others that ARMYs have increasingly became toxic. 

And to the ARMYs who will say they didn't see any attacks towards txt and people are just calling out for Jimin: just because the hate isn't appearing on your tl doesn't mean they don't exist. TXT is getting dragged, and it should be stopped.

Tldr: ARMYs have become the very people who they said they'll protect BTS from in the past.",https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/14h49db/armys_are_just_as_bad_than_the_fandoms_that_used/,ARMYs are just as bad than the fandoms that used to mock BTS for aiming to win a daesang or sold out stadiums.,kpopthoughts,t3_14h49db,/r/kpopthoughts/comments/14h49db/armys_are_just_as_bad_than_the_fandoms_that_used/,2023-06-23 17:20:23,BTS

10063,"This is a VERY random thought but hey, that's what this sub is for lol.

So my favourite band of all time is Fall Out Boy. For those who don't know, they're an American rock band who had a very extended hiatus between their 4th and 5th albums. As promotion for their 5th album, [they released The Youngblood Chronicles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Young_Blood_Chronicles), a series of music videos for each song that formed an overarching story. The entire collection is viewable in order on YouTube as well*.

I would LOVE for BTS to do something similar once they're all back. I know they've done overarching storylines before, but I'd love for them to make a MV for each song to form a movie/storyline. I feel like it would be an awesome celebration moment for fans and I just think these kind of things are super cool in general. Obviously it doesn't have to have the same concept one-for-one, but I think a musical film consisting of MVs is a cool idea to do for an album's promotion.

So what do you all think? Do you have any ideas for what BTS should do when they come back as a group?

Yo fam,

I know we're all hyped for 'For The Dogs'‚Äîtrust me, I'm counting down the days too. But as we anticipate this drop, I've been thinking about how Drake's been blessing us with new music lately. From 'Certified Lover Boy,' 'Honestly Nevermind,' to 'Her Loss,' he's been keeping us fed with tracks, and no complaints there.

Still, it got me wondering: should Drake slow down a bit between albums? Give us some time to fully digest one project before moving on to the next? Or are y'all cool with this steady stream of heat?

And once 'For The Dogs' is out there, how long you reckon Drizzy should chill before dropping his next album? Is there such a thing as too much music, or should we just ride this wave while it lasts?

Can't wait to hear your thoughts. No matter what, we can all agree we're in for a treat with 'For The Dogs'.

850,"Hi fellow ARMYs! I‚Äôm an adult ARMY who buys a lot of merch and has an excess amount of stuff, some of which is doing me no good at the moment. I would love to find a new home for some of this stuff with someone who will appreciate it. 

With the holidays coming up, I would really like to surprise an ARMY with a box of gently used Bangtan goodies. The items include some earrings for pierced ears and potentially some size small clothes, just FYI. The stuff also skews cute and seem too young for some people‚Äôs taste. 

My target audience for this post is someone who has an ARMY in their life who would appreciate getting some gently used Bangtan merch (official and fan made) for Christmas (or an upcoming birthday or whatever holiday you celebrate). Maybe your kid or younger sibling? Maybe your best friend? I would love to be their ARMY secret Santa. 

 I grew up very poor and remember how much it sucked to fangirl but never be able to have a poster on my wall or a t shirt of my favorite band. I also remember being fortunate to get gently used donations for Christmas each year because my mother couldn‚Äôt afford to buy me Christmas gifts. I like to pay it forward now that I can afford to. I know money is tight right now for a lot of people and buying fun things is on the back burner for many, even for holidays. I did something similar to this a few years ago with Harry Styles merch and it went really well. 

I only have enough stuff for one to three people right now so I‚Äôll remove this post when I get to that number of interested responses. I also can only ship within the US. If you respond here that you‚Äôre interested, I‚Äôll DM you to connect.

üê∞ im saying this because i keep seeing comments about it, but i dont have a girlfriend ! i just want to work right now. i dont have a girlfriend ! i dont feel the need. 

üê∞ okay my girlfriend is ARMYs, i only have ARMYs


if anyone is out of the loop, there's a video going around of a man hugging his gf inside an apartment and some people are speculating that it was jungkook. i personally believe it's him but whether it was him or not, it's definitely one of the creepiest shit i've seen in my 100 years of being a kpop fan. seeing someone filming a couple inside the comfort of their apartment being intimate isn't in my bingo card this year or honestly any other year. 

now, i believe there were tons of comments asking him about it and i'm 100% sure it was because of the video. bh and him have not acknowledge the video yet and we'll see in the incoming weeks if bh ever would. if we see them say they will sue, then it's him definitely. 

i get that the fans have no business asking him about his private life but i honestly wish he didn't say armys are his girlfriend. he already does weverse lives that kinda play into the ""boyfriend"" delusions a lot of armys have. and i understand it's all for fun but i'm pretty sure idols, including him know the possible reactions of fans when they do this kind of fanservice.

i wish he would just set the record straight and say, no he is single and left it like that...no need to say your fans are your girlfriends. 

before anyone jumps at me, i love jk. i defend him here but i feel uncomfortable when he does things that could feed into fans delusions like this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/16xv3q3/jungkook_saying_armys_are_his_girlfriendafter/,jungkook saying armys are his girlfriend......after denying he has a girlfriend,kpopthoughts,t3_16xv3q3,/r/kpopthoughts/comments/16xv3q3/jungkook_saying_armys_are_his_girlfriendafter/,2023-10-02 12:15:17,BTS
9979,"ive seen so many people say that bts became westernized (because of their few english songs) and i just find that so absurd because MANY kpop groups have english songs or English versions of their songs and some even have english albums/eps.  
And its not just 3rd and 4th gen groups‚Ä¶ you can go all the way back to boa who had an English album and many groups and soloists in 2nd gen had english versions of their songs.  
so why are bts talked about as if they abandoned their roots/are sell outs because they released a few english songs which is a pretty common thing in kpop?  
this year alone there have been a multitude of english songs by kpop groups...  
english: TWICE- moonlight sunrise, \*G1DLE- hea+, SKZ- super bowl, youthful, (and social path is practically an English song), TXT- devil by the window, do it like that, back for more, AESPA- hold me tight, better things, (and zoom zoom is basically an english song), MONSTA X- swing, THE ROSE- dual (album), NEWJEANS- get up (but the whole ep is practically english), formis\_9- wishlist etc.  
english ver.: TWICE- set me free, FIFTY FIFTY- cupid, LESSERAFIM- eve psyche and bluebeard's wife, P1HARMONY- jump, etc.  
nothing wrong with having english songs, thats why no one gets berated for it...excluding bts that is.

13619,"I was at the Drake concert early, walking through the stadium with my head down in my phone when I felt my body bump into another persons. Startled, I looked up to find myself staring into the soft brown eyes of Drizzy himself. My heart raced as I stammered out an apology, cheeks flushing with embarrassment. ‚ÄúEmbarrasinggg‚Äù he said with a warm chuckle, his smile making my heart skip a beat. In that moment time seemed to stand still as I tried to find my words, utterly captivated by the unexpected encounter with the superstar I had idolized for years. As the concert's soundcheck echoed around us, Drake's laughter filled the air, creating a bubble of intimacy amidst the stadium's chaos. He leaned in closer, his hand gently tilting my chin upward. ""You know,"" he whispered, his voice sending shivers down my spine, ""sometimes the best moments happen when we least expect them."" Without another word, he closed the gap between us, his lips meeting mine in a tender, electrifying kiss.
The world around us faded into oblivion as the music played on, and we shared a stolen, passionate moment in the midst of the concert crowd. It was a memory I would carry with me forever, the night I bumped into destiny at a Drake
concert. 

It was 5 years later in Toronto and who would I run into besides Aubrey himself. Upon bumping into me again, he said ""fancy seeing you again"". I giggled remembering the moment we shared on that beautiful night. We embrace again. ""I needed this"" drake said. ""wait how old are you"" he asked. I responded with my age of 18 and he said ""oopsies.
3 years past my preference"" and skipped away.

9646,"I will sum up and talk a bit about his [interview](https://www.wkorea.com/2023/01/20/in-fullbloom-jimin/), which I was looking forward to. The last time we were able to have a bit of deep dive into his thoughts was during *Proof* album but it's been a long time since and new challenges are coming their way.

Jimin started by sharing how overjoyed he was to have become a global ambassador for Dior *(fyi, he is the first male Asian global ambassador for Dior, and the fourth man overall)*. He wants to use this opportunity to study fashion a bit and contribute to the brand.

He also talks a bit about his solo album - *which is rumored to be out in February* \- and explains how his mind works harder than his body these days, as he takes part in the direction and plan of his album.

He shares that this album was made in light of how he feels *now*, after announcing a new chapter for the group. He says he tries to write everything down, as precisely as possible because he's afraid he'll forget those feelings if he doesn't write them down. He also added :

&gt;*""In fact, BTS and I have gone through many changes in the past few years. Because we've made it through together strong, I thought writing down my feelings and ideas would help me overcome any obstacles the next time I encounter similar hurdles like In a word, it was a time of reflecting on how I feel ‚Äì especially on what made me happy or worn out in the past.""*

He talks about working with a lot of producers and asking them for their opinions, and that it was all fun and enjoyable the more he worked on it, he also added :

&gt;*""Now I know why the members told me to write songs. However, creating a piece based on the emotions from the past was another matter. That was not all easy and fun.""*

He also adds that he doesn't have a clear answer for what he ""wants the most"" and that his best answer is that he wants to do ""*what he does now, better, and for a long time*"".

Speaking of performance, he had said in the past that his ideal performance would be to display himself in his best version. The journalist asks if we push the limit, mentally and physically, if we gave our all, can we achieve the best version of ourselves. especially knowing that Jimin is a perfectionist. He has answered :

&gt;*""It may sound harsh, but I believe what's important here is the result. The result of giving your all and the feelings you earn from such results are truly on a different level. In order to achieve the best result possible, you really need to focus on just one thing and put in a lot of effort.""*

Mentioning his experiences, like working as a project manager on the *BE* album, or writing his few of his own songs in the past, if that helped him with his album. He replies that despite the fun aspect, it's not easy to write lyrics that touch people, and that he has a new bigger respect for his members because of that.

He also talks about his first encounter with dance, which is so associated with him today because of his ""beautiful performances"". He candidly recounts that in middle school, he joined a break dancing club with friends at first because he believed it would make him popular.

Speaking of artists whose music has opened his emotions, like ""a new world"", he names Michael Jackson, and also how much he would have liked to see him while he was still alive. Also that he had been astonished by Chris Brown and Usher, and by the performances of BIGBANG and other K-Pop artists.

He also talks about how he feels after a passionate performance, in their concerts, what comes to mind before going to bed, and he replied :

&gt;*""I constantly hear cheering from the moment I get off stage to when I return to the hotel and fall asleep that night‚Äîit replays in my ears. Sometimes I feel this unique thrill even after the performance. It isn't just the sole emotion like emptiness or a specific feeling but multiple emotions flooding in at once. I get overwhelmed by indescribable emotions but it goes away when I lie down on the bed. Actually, only good feelings are left with me so I really miss the stage. I really want to be on the stage with the members of a concert.""*

He also talks about his collaboration with Taeyang, that it was one of his goals since he was young, he also adds that having had the opportunity to work with him, he discovered that Taeyang is an ""even greater person then he thought he was"".

And I'll end by quoting some answers and questions that stuck out to me.

&gt;**If there is one thing that you would like to praise yourself for in 2022 ?**  
&gt;  
&gt;*I once went to talk to the members, telling them I was off the course for a while. They were generous with so many comforting words and advice and gave me the strength to work on the solo album. So, I want to take this opportunity to be proud of myself for going to the members when I felt lost for the first time (laughs).*  
&gt;  
&gt;**What do you think you need the most right now ?**  
&gt;  
&gt;*Time. I need time to well-finish my twenties, prepare for my thirties, and navigate the direction beyond that. Also, I would like some time to complete my album, and have fun with my friends. I really wish I had more time.*   
&gt;  
&gt;**When you take away global superstar BTS packaging, marketing, and the glitter of the entertainment industry, who are you at your core ?**  
&gt;  
&gt;*A goofy friend in sweatpants, who loves to have soju with friends at Pojangmacha (the street food carts)*. 

I really liked this interview, we had the chance to have more indications on his upcoming project, what it entails and the degree of his involvement. But also a lot of anecdotes and informations, whether about him or his inspirations, or even BTS. I invite the most curious to read the entire interview as I have only shared the questions most centered on his upcoming solo.

6321,"Haven't seen many mentions of this song just yet, but it's easily in my top 5 (might even be number 1 currently, but that fluctuates by the hour). I might be biased because I heard this live at the Apollo and his vocals on the chorus absolutely floored me. If it feels like he's belting it out in the track, live was a whole other level. Ed just went for it.

The songscape is peak Evermore, and the vocals are probably his best in any song (in my opinion), surpassing Dive. But also the bridge!

So I will pour another drink  
And try to drown the pain with salt along the rim  
And I'll shut off the things I think  
'Cause nothing good will ever come from worrying

>Ticketmaster will send Verified Fan emails usually by 8/9pm local time to all who registered confirming whether or not they will receive a code or if they have been waitlisted. 

When will I receive my code?

>You should receive your code by 11pm local time via text message to the number linked to your ticketmaster account (this should be the same number you registered with). If you do not receive a code by the morning of the sale (Wednesday, October 25th, reach out to Ticketmaster - fastest way is by phone or through [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TicketmasterCS))

Are codes transferable? Can I use someone else's code? Can I buy a code from someone else?

>No! Codes are tied to the account that was registered and confirmed to receive an access code. You cannot use someone else's code to purchase tickets from your account, do not attempt to purchase someone's code with this intention. 

How do I access the sale?

>Use the direct link received in the email confirming you've been selected to receive a code. You will be prompted to enter your code once you enter the queue. 

What is the maximum number of tickets I can buy?

>You can buy a maximum of 6 tickets. Purchasing more than the allowed amount will result in Ticketmaster voiding your entire order.   
>  
>*Do not purchase tickets with the intent of reselling your tickets, leave it for real fans to purchase. This sub will not support the resale of tickets for anything more than face value.* 

Best tips for getting tickets?

>Sign into Ticketmaster early, before the presale starts and make sure you are logged into the correct account and your payment information is up to date.   
>  
>Join the queue at least 30 minutes early, between 10-15 minutes before the sale starts, the waiting room will be open.   
>  
>Know what you want before you get in, have a set budget and number of tickets in mind before you enter the queue. This will help you purchase faster and ensure you get the number of tickets you want.

I think we all as fans have clocked onto his ingenious (even Cherry alludes to it in the doc), but I really don't think Ed has.

First Off, I believe that BTS and TWICE have no chance to perform the Super Bowl Halftime Show, but this is good ideas of the setlist 

Super Bowl is mostly 15 minutes so many songs will be short sang, plus it unknown how the stage will look like or what things that may do to attract the audience. 

BTS
-ON
-Idols 
-DNA
-Take Two 
-Dynamite 
-Butter 

TWICE 
-Set Me Free (English) 
-Go Hard 
-Feel Special 
-The Feels
-Fancy 
-TT

Cover (by both team or song the  the guest performers)

She had a trip planned to New Orleans to see him. That's postponed. No refund and she went through ticket master, so who knows what happens. She had to settle for a credit for the plane tickets. She didn't want to wait for the ""postponed"" date. She got tickets and re-planned the trip for Nashville. Flight and hotel booked. Outfit bought. The same BS happened. 

In my opinion, Drake doesn't care about his fans or what happens to their money/lives because he is ""finishing an album."" It's disrespectful.

His best work recently was Honestly, Nevermind because he actually pushed his artistic creativity to something completely fresh.

CLB artwork was painfully cringe worthy and though the record was *good*, it just sounded like the result of copy+pasting ‚Äúdrake music‚Äù again. 

Her Loss was good, again the artwork was trash, and it did nothing to push artistic creativity or even challenge Drake. Not to mention, 21 Savage literally admitted to Drake helping him write his bars and verses. His collaborating artist barely even collaborated successfully. 

Let‚Äôs go back to Scorpion, which was divisive among this community. A packed album of genres (give him credit for that), sold incredibly well, but even lacked inspiration and had some of his worst songs to date.

40 doesn‚Äôt even produce his music anymore consistently.

Look at hip hop communities in general. I‚Äôve been on Reddit for Drake releases since 2014, and although he had moments where he was the butt of the joke, he is now more than ever being clowned on. His Instagram is so cringeworthy.

9809,"A lot of people would argue that YouTube views numbers or Spotify streams can't be taken seriously to assert a K-pop group's popularity, and I tend to agree most of the time. But particularly, I think it means something that we are more than halfway through this year and only these 5 groups have reached these numbers on these platforms. 

BTS and BLACKPINK are definitely the two biggest groups in K-pop right now, and their numbers come as no surprise to anyone. What calls my attention the most are the numbers of the other three groups in question. 

TWICE has always been a huge name in the K-pop scene but it was never JYPE's intention to promote the group in the west. Its focus has always been the Asian markets. And even so, they conquered a huge audience in practically the whole world. 

Stray Kƒ±ds are quite the opposite, having started their career as a group that didn't get much attention in Korea. But things definitely changed from 2020 with God' Menu, which was when they really exploded in the West and established their fan base mainly in countries in that region, only to later conquer Asian markets, such as China and Japan. 

I don't know to what extent this is an accepted opinion among K-pop fans, but I truly believe that right now, after BTS and BLACKPINK, Stray Kids and TWICE are the most popular groups around the world right now. Having a considerable difference between them and the groups that are below. 

 NewJeans is an even more curious case. The group definitely drew attention since their debut, but I doubt anyone expected that in such a short time they would reach such high numbers, not only in Asia, but also in the West, especially in the US. 

But the question remains: will HYBE be able to capitalize on the success of NewJeans in the west. After all, we must remember that there is a difference between people knowing the group and people actually willing to spend money with the group. 

I believe that currently, BTS, BLACKPINK, Stray Kids and TWICE are the only K-pop groups able to perform as big in the West as they do in Asian countries. Would NewJeans eventually be able to do the same? 

Now, I want to ask you, what do you think about these 5 groups being the only ones to reach these numbers this year? Do you believe that really means anything about how popular they are? And what do you expect from these groups for the future? Do you think they can still grow even more or have they reached their peak?",https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/14wad5f/bts_blackpink_twice_newjeans_and_straykids_twice/,"BTS, BLACKPINK, TWICE, NewJeans and StrayKids TWICE are the only Korean groups to surpass 1B streams on either or both Spotify and Youtube this 2023.",kpopthoughts,t3_14wad5f,/r/kpopthoughts/comments/14wad5f/bts_blackpink_twice_newjeans_and_straykids_twice/,2023-07-10 23:41:11,BTS

9604,"# Introduction and objective

It's time for a special /r/mashups contest for an upcoming collaborative mashup album that is currently in the works.

This album celebrates the 10th anniversary of the release of Grand Theft Auto V through mashups of songs from the Non-Stop Pop radio station found in-game. Luckily for you, music theory experts have analyzed the songs for you and have provided keys and tempos to help you out.

**For this contest, create a mashup where at least one prominent source is a** [**song played on the in-game Grand Theft Auto V Non-Stop Pop radio station**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DGaJN7WbxcPx1Cwbxp1rChcSq91PDy4h5tVaw5JnzJg/edit?usp=sharing) **(see linked workbook for a list). Bonus points for songs that are modal (Dorian, Phrygian, Mixolydian, Melodic Minor, etc. as marked on the workbook in bold). Songs that are underused, and do not have volunteers or submissions for the album, are preferred (# of Volunteers should be blank for the given song in the workbook).**

**Please keep in mind that this album will most likely not be released for at least a couple months, so you will need to keep your submission unreleased.**

I want you to do your very best. Some resources:

* Can't find stems? Extract them here: [https://mvsep.com/](https://mvsep.com/)
* [I've power ranked the best extraction algorithms here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/mashups/comments/u6ghk6/comment/i586cty/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
* [Best key detection software and databases](https://www.reddit.com/r/mashups/comments/uu5fn1/resource_best_databasessoftware_for_finding_keys/) is also linked in case you need it.

# [Submit your mashups here!](https://u.pcloud.com/#page=puplink&code=fKlkZ25zUTqgIEYfAJtaWUUVkG0E6PtN7)

# Deadlines

* **Submissions are due on Wednesday, May 24, 2023 at 8 AM EDT/1 PM BST.**
* **Voting will then proceed, and must be completed by Saturday, May 27, 2023 at 12 noon EST/5 PM GMT.**

# Guidelines

* All entries must be submitted as high quality lossy (MP3) or lossless (WAV/FLAC/ALAC) files.
* If you run into trouble submitting, please let the contest organizer know sooner rather than later.
* **To make it easier to compile, please include the title of the mashup and the artists used in the file name and/or audio tags.**
* **All tracks must be unreleased. No public submissions. Entries that are made public within the submission and voting periods may be disqualified. Do not upload previously submitted tracks to the album; these should be new.** While demos can be created prior to the contest, demos and final releases should not be made public (ex. YouTube) during the contest and before the album is released.
* There will be a voting phase from the Reddit community and a judging phase by the contest organizer, with results weighted 50/50.
* **Because these tracks will be in the running for a mashup album,** **please do your best to pay attention to source quality, key, tempo, structure, and effects like reverb**. These elements can all affect overall quality. [If you use Audacity, version 3.2 now supports real-time effects.](https://support.audacityteam.org/audio-editing/using-realtime-effects)
* Please do your best to **save your projects** and **use non-destructive/real-time effects** so that when any feedback is given on your track, it's easier to make any changes suggested.
* If you're going to use any overused songs or songs that have volunteers, make sure the mashup is executed well. There may be a limit on the number of times a specific song appears on the album.
* While it's good to challenge yourself further, don't push yourself too hard. You may get bonus points from your peers, but I'll ultimately judge on quality starting from minimum criteria.
* Whoever wins the contest **will not pick the next theme. Prizes, if any, will be announced.**
* If there are additional questions, feel free to comment within this thread. If you need track feedback, please send messages over DMs.

# TL;DR

This week's theme for the contest is **Grand Theft Auto V Non-Stop Pop Album.** Prizes, if any, to be announced.

**For this contest, create a mashup where at least one prominent source is a** [**song played on the in-game Grand Theft Auto V Non-Stop Pop radio station**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DGaJN7WbxcPx1Cwbxp1rChcSq91PDy4h5tVaw5JnzJg/edit?usp=sharing) **(see linked workbook for a list).

Songs that are underused, and do not have volunteers or submissions for the album, are preferred (# of Volunteers should be blank for the given song in the workbook).**

**Please keep in mind that this album will most likely not be released for at least a couple months, so you will need to keep your submission unreleased.**

Submission link is given above.

Please keep your projects. If there are enough quality entries, the album may be a reality.

I consider myself a baby army, i only started to get to know BTS in February last year. Getting to know BTS was one of those things that happened unexpectedly to me but it was one of the best things that could have happen to me in a long time. With that being said, I just want to take off my chest the AMAZING performance Yoongi gave us last night. I was no there physically unfortunately, but I watched it online as I am sure many of you did. Man, I need to say how proud I felt of yoongi because of the success the tour had . Needless to say how emotional it was just for the fact of seokjin and hobi presence and the Namjoon performance as well. I am so happy he was able to perform an unreleased song. 

I also love how versatil and talented yoongi is an artist. He did an amazing job as usual on the rapping. But also being able to sing vocal parts and playing instruments along. The only thing on my mind at that moment was that he is sooo cool. 

Anyway. Just wanted to talk to you a little bit about some of the thoughts I had when watching the performance and just say how happy and proud I feel.

1650,"TCT released in june '22 and the vinyl came out in february '23. Before the release of TCT he had been away for almost 3 years. And it still took so long before it was possible to get the vinyl of the album. Now, in may '22, he announces Austin and like a week later you can pre-order the vinyl which will release the same day as the album, just 2 months later.

How is it possible that it took so long with TCT for the vinyl to release and for Austin it's all taken care of so soon even though there was much less time between the making off/anounnce of the album and the release date??

Now, Blackpink alongside BTS are undoubtedly the biggest kpop acts in the world and have reached mainstream relevance the way other kpop artists (except Psy) have been able to. Yet I haven't seen this phenomenon of kpop girl groups being mistaken by Blackpink.

My theory is that either BTS is significantly more known than Blackpink among non-kpop fans or Blackpink members' faces and small number makes them more recognizable and memorable so people can tell it's not them.

Well a parasocial relationship between any BTS member exists, but Jungkook is going live a lot with personal insight on him- eating, sleeping, he darn drawls, and more.

He‚Äôs a grown man let‚Äôs not forget, but he‚Äôs also a grown man with the largest fan base- in a genre known for fans to harass idols. I‚Äôm more concerned about his safety due to the parasocial behavior he could unintentionally enable. 

*I THINK* it could be because he‚Äôs getting older, and tired of people calling him a ‚Äúbaby‚Äù as a 25 year old grown man. It COULD also be that the members are enlisting into the military, and want to make memories with fans before it‚Äôs his time to leave. I don‚Äôt know just my thoughts.

But he‚Äôs already trending on Twitter (ifykyk), and I‚Äôm just hoping fans don‚Äôt think this gives them the right to cross boundaries with Jungkook.",https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/15bjxsm/anyone_else_a_wee_bit_concerned_about_the/,Anyone else a wee bit concerned about the parasocial relationship jungkook could be brewing?,kpopthoughts,t3_15bjxsm,/r/kpopthoughts/comments/15bjxsm/anyone_else_a_wee_bit_concerned_about_the/,2023-07-28 01:41:47,BTS

At this point I was getting snappy and the teacher chose another kid with his hand up before me. As the word 'Lil' crept out of his mouth, my anger exploded and I knew I had to say something.  
""SHUT UP! EVERYONE JUST BE QUIET"" I retorted as I slammed my hand against my desk. As the crowd's piercing eyes settled onto me, I shot a nasty glare at the girl who had brought up Taylor Swift.  
""None of you know REAL music! None of you at all!"" I vehemently announced. As I began to unravel the musicianship, cultural poignancy, and political significance of Dynamite, my teacher marched to my seat and snarled: ""You brat! Don't you have any decency to let your classmates speak without causing a scene? I'm tired of your shenanigans! Get ou-"" I cut her off with a logical dilemma.  
""You're an English teacher, shouldn't you welcome the high-level, intellectual feedback of your most talented and gifted students? You should be honored I make time to show up here.""  
As she stood astonished, with a puzzled yet angered expression - I began to recite some of the most important and beautiful BTS lyrics:  
‚ÄòDing-dong call me on my phone‚Äô  


‚ÄòSmooth like usher like a crimnal on the covers‚Äô

'Ïñ¥Îäê ÎÇ† ÎãπÏã†Ïùò Ï£ÑÎäî Íπ®ÎÅóÌï¥Ïßà Í≤ÉÏûÖÎãàÎã§'  
Intending to recite the entirety of My Universe, I closed my eyes and began rapping like Jungkook. She shouted over my passionate expression of greatness for me to go down to the office ""RiGhT NoW!!"" Her voice was shaking and her legs were quaking.  
Not thinking, I shouted back, with my best Koreon impression: ""Make me, BITCH!"" and time seemed to stop. I felt the eyes of my classmates with daggers of judgement stepping through. In all honesty, I became emotional.  
Not knowing what to do or say, I whispered under my breath: ‚Äúlike ‚Äúa criminal undercover and sprinted outside to the parking lot.  
Long story short, I was 10 days of out of school suspension even though I explained everything to the principal. I guess not everybody is as enlightened and smart as I had hoped they'd be...",https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/18u22yf/bts_got_me_suspended_from_school_what_to_do/,BTS got me suspended from school. what to do?,teenagers,t5_2rjli,/r/teenagers/comments/18u22yf/bts_got_me_suspended_from_school_what_to_do/,2023-12-30 00:29:26,BTS

A friend of mine purchased this album from a used book store. As [this popular source](http://cafarnaumbox.blogspot.com/2015/12/how-to-spot-fake-signed-autographed-bts.html?m=1) suggests, the white version of HYYH pt. 1 is more uncommon than the other versions, which tugs at my suspicions that she purchased a fake. The placement of the signatures look okay, however the marker seems thinner than what I've seen in photos of the authentic signed album. Could anybody with greater expertise on the subject offer their take on the authenticity of this album? Thank you so much!

We've seen what happened to EXO and how they basically since 2018 have always had to have one member sit out a comeback one way or another.

Having all 7 members enlist at the same time or at least close to another only means that the time they will have to spend without group activities/away from each other is way less.

7049,"I have been an Ed Sheeran fan for over a decade. I actually was planning a trip to the UK to see him perform, but then he announced his first US tour in 2014 so I went to one of those shows first. Here are my honest thoughts. 

The first show I ever saw of him was amazing and has always been my favorite performance. He was young, eager, and had a ton of energy. You could tell on that tour he felt he had a lot to prove. His energy was incredible. 

The 8 shows following that were a mixed bag if I‚Äôm honest. I saw some that were great (but not as good as the first one). And some that if I‚Äôm being honest, I left feeling a little disappointed. Not because it was a bad show at all- but because I knew what he was capable of. Some of those shows he just seemed very tired. And it didn‚Äôt feel personal at all. It almost just felt like another check off the tour list. Something he had to do.

Now this brings me to last night in Chicago. THIS WAS THE BEST ONE YET!!! I love that there were songs with just him and the loop pedal still. But the songs with him and the band and him and other artists was a fun surprise and I loved it. This stage was definitely the most involved and I think it did a great job of including the whole crowd. But most of all his energy was refreshed, he seemed happy, and he expressed how grateful he was for all of us there numerous times - even acknowledging that a lot of people traveled hours üôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, got a hotel room, etc. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I would still definitely pay to see Ed again alone, on a stage, without a huge elaborate set. But his energy and overall well-being was unmatched at this performance. The first time I ever saw Ed still holds a special place in my heart. But this show will be hard to top.

I‚Äôm studying abroad in Italy this semester and was already booking a trip to London for the weekend of Nov 18th. When I saw that he was doing a show for Autumn Variations I started sobbing because how perfect is that! I‚Äôve never been to Europe before this trip and seeing my favorite artist ever in London the weekend I was already going?? What are the odds!!
I had already bought a CD for autumn variations and was expecting a code for presale but I never got one. I emailed Ed‚Äôs help team and they were super helpful and got me a code about 30 mins before the presale started (which was already stressful with timing lol) but I was feeling hopeful. Unfortunately I was 4000 in the queue and didn‚Äôt get any tickets. I tried again the next day but was unlucky. 
I‚Äôm just really bummed I won‚Äôt get to see him and trying my best to get tickets but it seems impossible! I‚Äôm still going to London that weekend in hopes of finding some last minute tickets or if I‚Äôm lucky a pop up!

9842,"I have never written a post a like this before, but I was moved to do it after coming across [this tweet](https://twitter.com/setiogi/status/1668782075590197249?t=V8_gqnewINqocWQ-ugYQeg&s=19). The article linked in the tweet is written by a mother and a Yale professor, and it talks about how BTS saved her daughter. It's a short article and I highly recommend you read it. As someone who found BTS during a very dark period in my life, I could relate so much to everything the author said. 

I have struggled with depression since I was a teenager. I have found various ways to ""deal"" with it and be a functioning member of society. But in 2019, my depression was hitting me a little harder than usual. My workplace had become very toxic and it was eating away at my mental health. It was around this time that I discovered BTS. I fell in love with not only their music but them as people. They were a source of comfort for me. Then the pandemic happened and with it, my mental health worsened. I don't want to get too much into it,  but it was bad. It was so bad that it affected my relationships with those around me and I found myself struggling to do day-to-day activities. I started relying on BTS to get through the day. A big part of it was their music which covers topics such as self-love and mental health. But it was also so much more than that. The way they were so emotionally open with each other, how they resolved conflicts, how they supported each other through their struggles etc. inspired me to do the same with those around me. They didn't feel ashamed about crying or offering words of comfort and appreciation for each other. This was shocking to me because all my life, I have been surrounded by toxic masculinity which forbids men from openly displaying their emotions. Not only did they speak about mental health, but they consistently walked the talk. Their level of emotional intelligence is something I still aspire to reach. Thanks to BTS, I started taking care of myself both physically and mentally. I got the courage to quit my toxic job. I started putting myself first. My mental health is so much better nowadays and I attribute part of it to BTS and the rest of it to myself.

I also can't help but mention the fandom - ARMY. A lot of times ARMYs are labelled as toxic in kpop spheres (sometimes deservedly so), but no one can deny the immense measures the fandom has taken to help and connect with others in various ways. ARMYs have organized many large scale and small scale charity projects and fundraisers to support causes such as BLM, rainforest conservation, ending child violence, helping LGBTQ+ people living in poverty etc. There are so many ARMY communities (?) that aim to help others such as ARMY Help Center (for those who need someone to talk to), BTS ARMY Medical Union (a group of licensed medical professionals who share information and lessons about health and medicine), One in an ARMY (for charity projects), ARMY Academy (for tutoring students), Bangtan Academy (a virtual school for learning Korean), BTS ARMY Bar Association (which provides educational information about law), Bangtan Library (which provides educational information about topics like sociology, humanity & science), BTS ARMY Food & Bar (if you're interested in F&D recipes), ARMY Film Club (for cinephiles) etc. Whatever your interests may be, there's a big likelihood that there's an ARMY community for it. Being a part of such an interactive and positive online community can be beneficial to people who struggle to connect with people offline. 

The fan translators are another incredible thing about this fandom. Whenever any member goes live, there's always a few fan accounts translating what they say in real time. Yesterday Jungkook went live and I could find at least 5 fan accounts which were translating it with only a 30 second delay. I don't know if this is common in other fandoms, but it surprised me at first that I had such quick access to the translations for free. Whenever a new album is released,  the translators come out with high quality translations for the songs in just a few days, sometimes even in the same day. A special shout-out to Doolset Bangtan whose website provides not only the translations, but also context for certain things that non-Korean fans might not understand. Thanks to the efforts of the fan translators, the language barrier between BTS and ARMYs is practically non-existent. The fact that ARMYs do all of this voluntarily and for free just because they share a common interest in BTS is something to commend. There's even a Twitter-like website that is being developed exclusively for ARMYs that will be available to use by the time BTS comes back in 2025. 

Something else I have noticed is the self-policing that is going on within the fandom. Without a doubt, there are toxic fans in our fandom. But recently I have seen more and more ARMYs speaking out about the toxic fans who spew hate about others. Sometimes it falls on deaf ears, but it's still a step in the right direction in my opinion.

In conclusion, BTS and ARMYs have created this inclusive space where people with varied backgrounds and interests can communicate with each other despite the language barrier. I'm proud to be a fan of artists who have helped millions of people around the world overcome their struggles. And I'm proud to be a part of this fandom which, despite its flaws, tries to do good and help others.

9830,"In our latest installment of [Suchwita](https://youtu.be/5xfosKUglZw), J-Hope was interviewed by Suga, aka Agust D aka Min Yoongi, to celebrate the first anniversary of Jack in the Box and we learned so many things. Here are some of the most surprising: 

1. J-Hope has an upcoming documentary to be released in 2024 called Hope In The Street. Hobi went to different cities around the world to film about street dance, his first love. 

2. The documentary will have a 6 song OST. It‚Äôs mostly music you can dance to with a happy vibe. 

3. Despite what many people thought, it was his idea to release Jack in the Box solely as a Weverse Album and LP. However, after so much desire from Army, he hurriedly prepared for the album to be released in cd form for its first anniversary. 

4. Hobi already has a six month plan post enlistment

5. Hobi and Suga would go to dance classes together and also to watch dance battles. 

All in all I absolutely enjoyed learning more about him and about Bangtan as a whole. Suchwita has become one of my favorite web talk shows. Suga is a great interviewer. I am also loving that the editors are furthering the Yoongi is a cat agenda.

Not even Michael Jackson was on this type of pace in terms of success and accolades.

I know some members like JK said he chose CK because he really uses the brand but member like Jimin doesn't even seem to be THAT  interested in fashion but he accepted both Dior and Tiffany.

BB latest album has received a lot of criticism, ironically. Since, he literally bashes critics every song. Going as far as texting that this album is to be enjoyed and not heard (whatever that means). But, one thing became clear to me‚Ä¶ this album is for the street culture in Puerto Rico and a tribute to everything that inspired him. 

Do you not see it? Putting Puertorican producers and artist that are running the street music scene in PR (Luar, Youngchimi, Bryant myers, Hydro, Mac, nengo, Arcangel, de la ghetto).

14067,"A month after FOR ALL THE DOGS's release, I just have to drop in and say that Drake made the exact album he was supposed to make at this point in his career. I'm sure Drake and team watch the streaming numbers, listen to the conversations online, and pay attention to the historical impact of his music. 

This album is the definition of a Drake album. When people feel something is missing in the music, if I'm not being stubborn, I can see their perspective. There's no ""Look What You've Done,"" ""Too Much,"" ""Cameras"" or ""From Time"" type of record that sonically places us into the somber recesses of Drake's nostalgic mind. There's no ""Western Road Flows,"" that is a straightforward rap reflection of his life. I understand. 

I'll say this though. If you look at the songs that EVERYONE loves from Drake over the last few years and continues to vibe to: ""Redemption,"" ""Fire and Desire,"" ""Jungle,"" ""Jaded,"" ""Pipe Down,"" I could go on and on---""Teenage Fever."" They are all R&B cuts and their high streams display how many times people go back to those records over time. Shit now people are saying ""Hours in Silence"" is a masterpiece like ""Middle of the Ocean"" isn't right there. 

Melodic Drake out streams all of his rappity-rap outros and his time-stamp records. I'm pretty sure Drake and team have taken note of that fact. The numbers show that Drake must sing to retain dominance, so why would he stop? None of his peers can sing as good as him, so he might as well continue.  

Did you know ""March 14th,"" one of Drake's most open and honest rap songs, hasn't even cracked 100 million streams? ""After Dark"" has passed 100 million streams for goodness sake. ""Is There More"" on SCORPION, where Drake is asking what more of this life is there beyond his current mundane/hedonistic lifestyle, hasn't cracked 100 million streams when even ""Finesse"" has. Don't get me started on how no one listens to ""The Remorse"" and how dark, honest and depressing he gets on some of those bars. That song has less streams than ""Get Along Better With Your Friends"" and ""F\*\*\*\*G Fans."" If you're Drake, what would you do?

You see the pattern by now. If you're a business, you strategize around what the people are liking and it's R&B Drake. The numbers show that Drake fans cherish his melodies as much, if not way more than his rapping. 

That brings us to FOR ALL THE DOGS. What are the songs everyone loves so far? Melodic Drake. ""Drew a Picasso,"" ""Bahama's Promises,"" ""Polar Opposites,"" ""Virginia Beach,"" and ""Tried Our Best."" He even noticed how fans don't stream his bar heavy, journey reflective outros and tried a different approach by giving fans ""Away From Home"" which is divergent from his typical formula. 

Regardless, FOR ALL THE DOGS is great. People don't really want Drake to rap for Alchemist beats for 15 songs straight. The streaming numbers say so. On ""Sandra's Rose,"" Drake says, ""**Niggas want a classic, that's just ten of these.""** He's aware guys. I don't think he should ever do it though.

1. Virginia Beach : 9/10  
2. Amen : 8/10  
3. Calling For You : 7/10

23. Polar Opposites : 8/10  
**AVG : 7.48**  
Overall thoughts : Some really high R&B highs, but too many misses for me but it's a 23 track album I guess. I wish more songs were cut but it is what it is, I liked a solid chunk of the album so will probably just make a playlist of that.  
***Her Loss***

3. On BS : 8/10  
4. BackOutsideBoyz : 8/10

8. Treacherous Twins : 8/10  
9. Circo Loco : 8/10  
10. Pussy and Millions : 9/10  
11. Broke Boys : 8/10

15. 3 AM on Glenwood : 8/10  
16. I guess It‚Äôs Fuck Me : 9/10

14468,"Let‚Äôs be real, something has happened between Drake & Future. The fact Future has been nowhere near Drakes album & the way Metro is clearly hating towards Drake.

Drake typically disses artists on people affiliated to someone he‚Äôs beefing. Biggest example is Travis Scott albums. Sicko Mode & Meltdown.

Then the only song on ‚ÄòHer Loss‚Äô thats produced by Metro who‚Äôs currently making an album with future & they‚Äôre known to be very close collaborators. 

Drake says‚Ä¶

‚ÄòFuck, let me kick it basic
Niggas ain't got love for the boy, so they fake it
Crack a couple jokes to some bitches on some snake shit
But if I send a verse to they ass, then they'll take it
Shoot a video, arm around me like we aces
Or pop out at my shows, jump around with me on stages
Probably why these hoes love to shower me with praises

Hello, redditors!  
Could you tell me which place will give you the best view for Ed's concert in Europe (Sofia, Bulgaria).  
I'm torn between the blue and green sectors, but I'm concerned about the positioning of Ed's mics, because when he sings on the two mics on the stage, one of the two sectors will look at his back. From  
videos in YouTube, I have come to a conclusion (but it's not final) that he will be ""face to face"" with the people in the green sector. The red sector is more expensive because it's under the roof.

Attached you can see the stage view and a snap from YouTube where the ""tongue/trail"" is behind him and in Sofia there is alos something like ""tongue/trail"", which is in front of the blue sector.

It's getting tiring seeing everyday on different platforms people just randomly very casually shading BTS or just downplaying their success. People need to realise that BTS have shaped so much of the kpop industry we see today be it with US promo, deals, social media marketing and MANY other things. Some of the group would not even be here as we know them now if not for BTS. Hybe was literally possible BECAUSE of BTS. They are living legends at this point. I don't know if they are newer kpop fans or what.. 

I think many people internally agree to this but somehow still love to hate on them for whatever reason. It has become a trend at this point. I usually don't mind these that much but it's really getting ridiculous at this point from past few weeks..

The Coachella set felt disconnected like it was a random mash of his songs. I appreciate the history of salsa and Latin American music being shown since it wasn‚Äôt in the tour. But why not bring out one of those legends like Tego Calderon or Daddy Yankee?

The transitions were really rough and it doesn‚Äôt help that the second half had so many cringe-worthy technical and audio issues.

To me, Drake is pinnacle anything before Views but especially IFRTITL and NWTS. To me, Drake stopped being authentically vulnerable and started guarding his heart like his property and that comes across in his music. Are we ever going to get another Marvin‚Äôs Music? Too Much?

Drake then replied with sadness: ""Dad, I just wanted to work around you, because I love you."" His father then hugged him and told him: ""Aubrey, I love you too but you cannot fake a degree. Lucky you I was the employer."" Then he give Drake his phone and says: ""Son, you should look for a summer job that requires no skills, okay?"" Drake accepts to apply for a job at an amusement park as a cashier.

Once they called for a job interview in the amusement park in question, he got there wearing a tuxedo and decided not to lie this time, not even about his age. He told them he was 39 and still living in his parents' house. Luckily, he got accepted as a cashier and was so busy, he ended-up spending only an hour per day on Roblox. At the end of the summer, he had $700 and bought clothes to impress his classmates.

jimin's campaign for dior is a huge deal because it's is all over the world. i remember some fans saying it took quite a while for most idols to land huge campaigns for the luxury brands they are ambassadors of. and usually the ads are just within asia from what i know. but jimin's campaign is on 50+ locations so far and in 4 different continents.

**It‚Äôs simple: leave your WYDs down below in the comments and then let others leave their reasons of what they‚Äôd rather.** 

The classic example is, would you rather 5 x Jungkook or a 5-year old Jungkook? But your WYD can be song-related, content-related or absolutely whack. For example:

* Would you rather be in an episode of Bon Voyage or In The Soop?
* Would you rather have BTS *finally* perform Paradise or Louder Than Bombs?
* Would you rather go for a bicycle ride on a super hot and humid day with Namjoon or have a 3 hour gym session with Jungkook where he goes all out?
* Would you rather metal concept Bangtan or country concept Bangtan?
* Would you rather have a sneak peak into the Genius Lab and listen to unreleased songs or have a sneak peak at Hopefilm and see pictures from over the years?

The more silly, lighthearted and absolutely abstract, the better. Plenty of links to evidence is highly encouraged!

6561,"I still remember the time when I first heard ""Lego House"" by Ed Sheeran. At that time, I wasn't familiar with the artist behind the song, but I instantly fell in love with every single line. He wasn't particularly well-known in my country back then either. However, my admiration for him grew exponentially after his album 'Multiply' was released. I cherished that album immensely at the time. Later, when 'Divide' came out, he became a global sensation, and his popularity soared in my country following his divide tour here. In my opinion, he is the ultimate singer-songwriter of all time. His music has served as a therapeutic escape during my toughest moments, and I am incredibly grateful to him. I sincerely hope that one day I will have the opportunity to meet Ed, express my heartfelt gratitude, and give him the most heartfelt hug while shedding tears of joy.

*Hey everyone, welcome to a new 4 episode series where I'll be talking about BTS. This four-episode series will be me ranking things from BTS. In today's episode, we will look at the leader RM as I rank his solo music from my least favorite to my favorite. We will also see RM go from Rap Monster, so he changed his name to RM. I'll be ranking J-hope, Suga, and BTS in later episodes, so look out for that in 2023. Let's Jump Into RM's Career and see where his solo songs rank.*

**10.**[Fantastic (Feat. Mandy Ventrice)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW6kivqfJB0)

*My least favorite release comes from 2015 when RM dropped a track for Marvel Fantastic 4. What a generic song from RM as he rap over this club beat that doesn't do much for me. I'm not interested in anything this track has to offer, as it sounds more like a cash-grab movie tune. RM has decent rapping, but more is needed to save this tune. Mandy sings the chorus and could sound more enjoyable, making the hook forgettable. I'm glad RM did something for Marvel, but this is different from what he should be doing since it feels like something I could hear coming out in 2009 or 2010. I always try to forget that this song exists since it's RM's worst release in his career.*

**9.** [P.D.D (With Warner G)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFArWe1MLW8)

*The song hitting number 9 is way better than Fantastic, but not one of my favorites. RM has way better rapping in this tune as he raps over this G-funk sound beat, which surprised me first. I might not be the biggest fan of this track, but I have to give RM credit for his delivery and the lyrics that hit hard.  Warner G produced this song, which was cool to see as he was one of the rappers BTS met on American Hustle Life. Once in a while, I see myself coming back to this tune, but only sometimes. I recommend that anyone check this out, even if you still need to.*

**8.** [Change (With Wale)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O47F3uRQAfU)

*The next song on the list is a lot of people's favorite, as he worked with American Rapper Wale. I like this track but listen to it less. RM spits fire over this killer beat that helps craft the emotion that RM brings to the table with his flow and lyrics. The hook could've been better, but it doesn't take away from the overall vibe. As I listen to this track again, I hear parts of Change Pt.2 in this tune. Again, Wale comes into the second verse spitting fire, constantly flowing well with the slick production. The message that this song brings to the table is perfect for working well with both artists. Even though this tune isn't higher on my list, I still love it and revisit it several times a year.*

**7.** [Reflection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D78QseJtht8)

*Reflection is an RM solo from the Wings album that grew on me. RM sings during the track's opening showing a different side of himself. However, we still get some rapping from the artist that blends well with the production he helped craft. The chill atmosphere grew on me, making me like this song a lot. It's not a tune in your face, but one that can help you feel relaxed. The singing moment's fit well with the rapping sections that this tune brings to the table. This is a decent song for RM, as it showcases something different.*

**6.** ['RM' 1st Mixtape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9glZVktVKVw)

*In 2015 RM released his first mixtape blowing people away with his rapping and production skills. Eight songs on this project contain the original artists' original beats before RM rapped over them. The piano opener, Voice, is beautiful, starting the project on fire. You can feel the emotion from his rapping that hits hard for an opening song. We got some singing moments in Voice, which was cool to hear from RM then. However, do You is my least favorite song from the project since he raps over Aerosol Can beat, a Major Lazer song. So much emotion is felt throughout this project as RM spits fire. Grown Simba By J. Cole is the beat for Monster, which is one of my favorites as it shows how good RM is at rapping. Oh My Darling Don't Cry By Rune Thee Jewel is the beat RM used on Joke, which shows RM spitting fire with his rap technique. As RM raps on Joke, it sounds like he is going insane, which adds to his excellent performance. There is only one feature on the album, which is Krizz Kaliko which surprised me with how well they went together. I Don't Listen to this Mixtape much, but It's starting to grow on me more than ever.*

**5.** [Intro : Persona](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl590lYe5MM)

*The intro to Map The Soul persona is a solo where RM spits bars over this rock-sounding beat which works well for him. His rapping is one thing that keeps me coming back to this song a lot. The bouncy beat has this killer guitar that adds a rock sound that works wonderfully with the rapping from RM. We also get a little Mario coin sample in the beat if you listen closely. Hiss Noise does a killer job crafting the production with this album, as it fits the artist wonderfully. What a great intro from RM, who delivers some excellent rapping.*

**4.**  [Bicycle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uq3P7zeYyU)

*Bicycle has a Mono-type feel but more of an upbeat trap feel. RM sings a lot in this song, which sounds excellent and works well with this bouncy trap tune I've been returning to since it dropped. I know people want him to rap more than sing, but if he is happy doing something different, we should support him. I also like how synth-heavy this tune fits the few rap moments that pop in from time to time. I remember it first dropped and falling in love with it right away, as it fits RM perfectly. The hook also stuck in my head as it helped bring me back to this tune.*

**3.** [Mono](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUb1_zjRSYs)

*My third favorite thing from RM is his second mixtape, Mono which takes RM in a more chill direction. Again, Tokyo does an excellent job opening up the project as RM sings more than he did on his first mixtape. The piano melody fits well with his voice as the laid-back feel relaxed me. Mono is diverse as it shows us a side of RM we didn't expect from him. Moonchild is my favorite song from this project one. I remember listening to it a lot when it dropped. This bouncy chill-trap tune fits RM well as we get singing and rapping moments. The crispness of the production helps to make this tune epic. everythinggoes features the rock band Nell, known for its experimental sound. RM and Nell fit well together, making this an interesting song for the project. Finally, forever Rain closes out the project seeing RM singing/rapping even more, as it does a perfect job closing the mixtape. I still see myself returning to this mixtape after a couple of years since it's been out.*

**2.** [Trivia Êâø: Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiKZ_4EkYsA)

*The next solo takes us to Love yourself Answer, where RM delivered my second favorite solo. Trivia Êâø: Love is this bouncy rap tune that shows RM rapping and singing. Slow Rabbit does an excellent job with the crisp production that blends well with RM's voice. The piano melody and the high hats fit well together, crafting this beautiful vibe. RM does spit some bars that keep me coming back for more. This song was released before Mono came out. Now one thing I always notice is the backup vocals which sound like Jimin or Jungkook. I know it's probably not them, but it would be cool if it were. I still find this to be my second favorite from RM and one I'm always listening to.*

**1.** [Indigo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxdgwUncvqA)

*After taking December to decide on my all-time favorite solo release from RM, I finally picked it. Indigo is my favorite release from RM as it shows his more artistic side. Yun (with Erykah Badu) opens the album with an old-school rap feel, with RM rap sound crisper than ever. I know people wanted RM to rap; this is a song you need to hear. Erykah Badu does an excellent job with the chorus section fitting well with the overall vibe. You can feel the emotion throughout this project, but the opening song hit me the first time hearing it, and it still does. Forg\_tfu features Kim Sawol and showcases RM going in a folk direction which I didn't expect. John Eun's crisp production blends well with the artist's vocals, as RM sounds terrific on this tune. Hectic with Colde sees RM going in a City pop direction which I didn't expect, but after hearing it, I fell in love with it. Indigo is an artistic project showcasing how much RM has grown as an artist and how versatile his music can be.*

Recently been going through a little bit of a rough patch and this song has just been really hitting home for me. It‚Äôs so incredibly relatable, it‚Äôs scary. I wanted to write this to show my appreciation. I think this song is by far the best song on Austin. 

But also to discuss with you guys how incredibly genius his use of the word smile is in this song. To me it has 3 meanings or pronunciations. 
*Somehow
*Smile
*Some ha-ha-how (literally laughing)

4604,"He figures the only way to express these emotions is through music.  Being inspired by the music of his favorite nu metal bands ‚ÄúGurney‚Äù and ‚ÄúDead Pigeons‚Äù, he forms his own band, enlisting the talents of his loser goth and burnout friends.  After mulling over various names, they settle on ‚ÄúIncubator‚Äù and begin writing songs.  

Months later, Incubator notices a flyer for the school‚Äôs annual talent show.  ‚ÄúThis‚Äôll be our big break, fellas, the moment the whole wide world will know the name ‚ÄòIncubator‚Äô!‚Äù ‚ÄúYou can say that again, Aubrey!‚Äù says the goth kid

So, they go to the audition and perform songs that they‚Äôve been practicing such as ‚ÄúCockroach Intercourse‚Äù ‚ÄúDying Weasels‚Äù and ‚ÄúInfections‚Äù.  Of course, the audience despises what they hear and throw rotten tomatoes and boo them.  A comically long hook then yanks them off stage.

Do you guys think this trend will continue with the upcoming Subtract *'-*' album? Despite this album being a special one for the fans, I can't help but think that Ed will still have at least 2 songs for the radio. 

A fan who has listened to Ed playing 8 of the songs from Subtract live on the Union Chapel event (posted on her instagram, but I can't find the link to it) that Ed played on last October did mention to watch out for two songs: 'Love In Love Out' and 'No Strings'. Ed also did mention that he was supposed to release a song that he wrote with Max Martin which was supposed to be the big hit from '*=*' which was ultimately removed as it did not sonically fit the album.

The way people have been obsessed with the idea of Jungkook becoming the Beyonc√©/Justin Timberlake/Harry Styles of his group has been so frustrating to witness. You had solos pushing the idea, and even some ARMYs accusing Hybe of trying to make it happen when 

1) Not a single thing that Jungkook did during his promotion cycle hadn't been done by another member before. His rollout was really standard for a promotion targeting the west and people were screaming favoritism... (Can't imagine what ppl would be saying if he had a solo tour like Yoongi or if he headlined a festival like J-hope).

2) If they did, they wouldn't have Jungkook rest for a year just to let him enlist right after releasing his solo album. I'm pretty sure Hybe shareholders would actually have preferred to get as much money out of him as they could, so this enlistment plan was clearly the member's decision.

And I'm not even going to talk about the antis and other member's solo stans trying to push the narrative that as ""Scooter's pet"", he owned to his succes to him or something. Using the fact that Scooter is one of the ceo for BTS western promotions as a drag and a dig Jungkook's artistery, calling him a sellout and accusing him of trying to outsine the group.. it was under EVERY SINGLE tweet ever since he debuted as a soloist and frankly a nightmare to deal with it. I might get some heat for this but I also saw quite A LOT of 'ot7s' buying into it or even fueling the flames by voicing their ""concerns"" and shading JK's success on chart/victimising the other members. 

Anyways, it hurts to see maknae line (yes RM is part of maknae line, no one can't tell me otherwise)  enlist now, and Jungkook is my bias so it hurts all the more, but I understand and respect his choice. He could promote with the rest of the group in 2025 just to enlist later in like 2028 and call it a day, many idols have done so before and no one would fault him for that. But he choose to enlist early after turning 26 so that we can all put enlistment anxiety behind us in 2025. He told us sine the beginning that the group comes before any solo career he could have and people who doubted that have just not been listening to what he's been repeating. He sacrificed a lot of his youth to BTS, and his dedication to his group and fans is truly admirable. As a JK stan, I love him all the more for this.

I know he has since fallen from grace, but I have always heard that Lucas was immensely popular at his peak. It was said that he had the kind of broad market appeal that would work in China, South Korea, Southeast Asia and (potentially) the West.

9726,"I can already imagine the fandom wars getting worse. If you thought the ARMY and Blink wars were crazy, just imagine how much worse it would get since they would fight about who the best girl group would be. 

Speaking of, I still believe BTS (as a girl group) would still be popular as they are now, if they were to keep the same music (although they might have to change some concepts and lyrics).

The 3rd Gen girl group competition would also be even more intense. Imagine BTS, Twice, Blackpink, Gfriend, IOI, Red Velvet, Mamamoo, or even Momoland etc. And again, the fan wars would be very intense. It just might be overwhelming.

And the boy groups would have more of an opportunity to be the top boy groups. Some 3rd Gen boy groups include: iKon, Wanna One, NCT, Monsta X, EXO, GOT7, Seventeen etc.

They would also not have to worry about enlistment and so they would not have to worry about being on hiatus as a group.

10976,"This might be a hot take/unpopular opinion but Drake needs to do better live. 
Drake needs to stop singing his raps, sounds really weird when the song is supposed to go hard but he decides to put on his singing voice. I also think he needs to stop begging the crowd to sing louder every song. I get that its to interact with the crowd but he does it 3-4 times each song and it really just makes it seem like the people are not singing when you can hear that they are. At one point they can‚Äôt get any louder and it makes it seem like the crowds not feeling it.

Anyone else agree or have any thoughts on his live performances?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Drizzy/comments/12atvo3/drake_needs_to_do_better_live/,Drake needs to do better live!,Drizzy,t3_12atvo3,/r/Drizzy/comments/12atvo3/drake_needs_to_do_better_live/,2023-04-03 18:52:40,Drake

7814,"I saw Ed live back in June at MetLife and thought the show was amazing. It was very minimal for his level of fame in terms of theatrics, just him on stage with his guitar singing live. No gigantic screens, light up flooring, no backing tracks, no synchronized wristbands, and it was amazing because it just felt genuine. He felt so down to earth and connected well with the crowd. I had a new level of respect.

His documentary was amazing, such respect for him. Him and his wife are legit what couple goals should be, what an amazing relationship they‚Äôve grown. The emotions felt in regard to the loss of Jamal, the interviews with his parents, his childhood friends still close to him, his humbleness, his work ethic.. I was just blown away. The editing was on point, the incorporation of his new and old songs was perfect. I could‚Äôve watched this series all day had there been more episodes.",https://www.reddit.com/r/EdSheeran/comments/18j44t6/i_watched_the_disney_documentary_last_night_and/,I watched the Disney+ documentary last night and wow,EdSheeran,t3_18j44t6,/r/EdSheeran/comments/18j44t6/i_watched_the_disney_documentary_last_night_and/,2023-12-15 16:35:19,Ed Sheeran
