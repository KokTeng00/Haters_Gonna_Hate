Due to Drake postponing New Orleans again and with rumors being it will be in either November of this year or next year, as I'm a college student and can't make any more room on my schedule I am selling my floor GA ticket for 500.85$ which is the exact amount I paid for it.

"**The other parent chaperones**.

- Not following the rules in the dining hall and then not enforcing the rules either so kids at their tables were constantly getting up out of turn
- Not doing the little things.  Some other kid dropped something?  I'd watch parents just walk by and not do anything (I picked it up and made sure it got back to the kid that dropped it).
- Not treating other people's kids as their responsibility.  I'm on this trip and 10 families are trusting me to take care of their kids.  I treated each one like my own as if they were my own.
- AT 9:40 PM as I'm escorting a kid to the nurses' station, I see a group of girls come up without a chaperone.  I ask and they said their chaperone sent them here and she was going to go find her daughter!  Like, what the actual fuck?!?  We literally saw a bear that same morning.

The kids?  Yeah, they were loud.  Yeah, they misbehaved.  Yeah, they were a bit obnoxious at time.  Yeah, they didn't want to sleep when it was lights out.  But they were all right.

Parents were absolutely the worst.  You kids are gonna be alright; don't be like these parents.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/145giqf/i_just_got_back_as_a_chaperone_from_an_outdoored/,I just got back as a chaperone from an outdoor-ed trip with 200 teen/pre-teens.

I don't dislike him at all, but I really only know some of his hits like Congratulations, Rockstar, Psycho, etc. I have pretty much no knowledge of his catalog beyond that though. Would it be worth it for a non fan like me to see him in concert? Is he a good performer? Would I have to know a lot of his music to vibe with him? Thanks in advance!

"I could say ""j-hope is in a league of his own"" and that is enough said, given how multi-talented he is and how much he has accomplished in the last year that sets him apart. What I'm specifically excited in the last few days is his upcoming role in fashion and what brands he will choose to represent (if at all!) He has so much potential that it's no surprise that he has a choice in what brands he wants to represent, yet the pull to be treated like an ambassador, and will steal the spotlight regardless.

He was invited to LV and [wore](https://mobile.twitter.com/LouisVuitton/status/1616449551681863680?cxt=HHwWgICy1bGT5O4sAAAA) a special colour fit that has not been revealed yet, while actual ambassadors wore the upcoming collection. He was photographed at the LV headquarters in Paris and was also filmed in another fit walking around. He had the audacity to show up to the Dior show looking like a [god](https://mobile.twitter.com/Dior/status/1616496648141606929?cxt=HHwWosC40eHI-e4sAAAA) and is the [rising related search topic](https://mobile.twitter.com/jhope_trends/status/1616744196555120640?cxt=HHwWgIC9hf2R6u8sAAAA)in relation to the brand. He met the Arnault's - Bernard Arnault (CEO of LV), Delphine Arnault (director of LVMH and CEO of Dior), and Frederic Arnault (CEO of TAG Heuer). He was also followed by Kim Jones (artistic director of Dior) in the run up to Paris fashion week. They're just the people we know about, by the way. We don't know what plans he has upcoming or the people he has connections with, but it's exciting just the possibilities alone.

It really shows his star power that he can be invited to shop around brush elbows with higherups in fashion without being tied down. Speculating now, but it makes me wonder if he might represent the parent company **LVMH** which owns 75 subsidiaries brands, including LV, Dior, and Kenzo (who recently followed him on IG). While unorthodox, I wonder if there's a possibility of something like that, or a potential collaboration. It's incredibly impressive having the power to take on multiple brands, yet having the nerve to walk away if he wants.

My next speculation is whether or not he will ever venture into a fashion of his own: he has what it takes. He's so meticulous in whatever looks he puts together and has already created a self-brand with his airport looks alone. He's daring enough to annoy Knetz by showing up in a denim jacket with no shirt on underneath or simply having his underwear band showing. He even made national news by posing in a condom shirt on IG that promotes safe sex. He intentionally (or unintentionally) makes a statement about what he wears. He dips into what is trendy but also has his own fun with it. He has so much potential and I can't wait to see what he does next.",https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/10hrm42/jhopes_fashion_power_is_in_a_league_of_his_own/,j-hope's fashion power is in a league of his own,kpopthoughts,t3_10hrm42,/r/kpopthoughts/comments/10hrm42/jhopes_fashion_power_is_in_a_league_of_his_own/,2023-01-21 13:46:47,BTS,0.11181668

"Hey all, I've been following kpop for around 7 years now. I followed BTS  a lot, but I remember that when I first started following Kpop and even up to around 4 years ago, BigBang was seen as the undisputed GOAT boy group. I remember people used to call them the kings of Kpop.

But now I look at BTS with their absolutely insane amount of listeners and followers on all platforms and I feel like BigBang might have been dethroned. The fact that BTS ended the EXO debate and pulled light-years ahead of any other BG just kind of fuels my thought. 

No other BG comes close to BTS right now, so have they surpassed BigBang in Fame, Influence, and general popularity?

Are BTS the kings of Kpop now?",https://www.reddit.com/r/kpophelp/comments/153ydn1/has_bts_surpassed_bigbang_in_fame_influence_and/,"Has BTS surpassed BigBang in fame, influence, and popularity?",kpophelp,t3_153ydn1,/r/kpophelp/comments/153ydn1/has_bts_surpassed_bigbang_in_fame_influence_and/,2023-07-19 15:35:56,BTS,0.25727063

"I think for Drake’s next tour he should entertain the idea of a stadium tour for these reasons 

1. He’s still got a lot of star power behind his name to pull a move like this off

2. I’m pretty sure he can do a lot with the spaces (I.E. a live band, big screen visuals, better special effects on stage etc) and he definitely has the budget to do it 

3. His catalog is still one the best catalogs of all time his catalog is deep with a lot of hits that would definitely have the crowd going  crazy.

"Woke up headed to the Post Malone concert. Got there an hour earlier than it said we were allowed to enter the parking lot, but what do you know it’s been open. Walk up this hill to the line, My husband asks if early entry VIP was this line. They sent us elsewhere , fine. After waiting for ten mins, they tell us early entry is somewhere else. Walk a mile there. No one can tell us if it’s the right line… moved again. Still no one at the venue knows. Some say it’s right some say it’s not. So we get in (5 hours early in dead summer). Then no one can tell us what line is next, so we are with a bunch of the VIP early entry & we are all getting the run around. 

Then we are waiting and asking everyone. Some say to stay some say don’t in that line. But we all paid a lot extra to be first in the pit. Finally @ 5 they let us down and then say of wrong row to enter turn around, so everyone who was behind us is in front now. Then we get in , whatever at the rail. Nope tell us we were supposed to be in cause we were in the wrong spot & there’s a huge line of early entry. All of us are like no we are early entry the staff told us to stay here & that side is saying the same. Then we all are mad, that side bum rushes as we get in & it’s crazy. So at this point there’s no waters or anything cause if you leave pit you’re not getting back in. People are passing out and throwing up left & right, and right before Post comes on ( 30mins late) I pass out. My husband takes me to medical, they say they can’t help us to our car. But try and tell us where our lot is (we say lot blue). No one knows where lot blue it, so they keep sending us in different directions (this place is giant) so we are all turned around. Finally get to a lot, I can barely stand, I’m now having an endo flare bleeding like crazy like I have for the past four months straight now. Mike ask security, the cops on golf carts to please help us cause we can’t find the car. NO ONE WOULD! Said “we can’t sorry”. TWO HOURS of walking around not finding our car. I’m laid up on the side of a pole crying and still no help. No signs of what color lot we are in, no way to figure it out. I finally flag down an ambulance and they helped. Our car got surround by huge RVs (boxed in basically) and unable to see. (Also like no lights in the lot besides a couple on the ends) so at this point concert is over & everywhere is trying to leave, couldn’t get out of the lot for nearly two hours once we got to our car.

"The CMA's were this week and although I thought the performances and such were better than usual, it did show the real truth to how the ""Pay to Play"" system in Nashville is in full effect.

&#x200B;

By any means am I saying Lainey Wilson did not deserve her awards. The success that she's had the last few years and the momentum she has had is truly incredible and after listening to podcasts and interviews she has worked very hard, even stating she did over 180 shows this year which is crazy AND lets not forget she's helping or in my opinion leading the charge to bringing women back to the fore front of country music, which I think is amazing. BUT I don't think she deserved Entertainer of The Year

&#x200B;

This move seemed to be a nashville industry move for sure. I think Morgan 100% deserved it. UNFORTUNATELY his scandal from a few years ago is still haunting him and persuading people to still think differently no matter how successful he was become the last few years.

&#x200B;

NOT ONLY having the #1 album and having ""You Proof"" being a MASSIVE #1 hit BUT having 10 singles on the album going top 10, thats absolutely insane to think about!

&#x200B;

Lets not forget a completely sold out tour with MULTIPLE nights in stadiums, like selling out my hometown stadium Fenway Park 3 times, something nobody has ever done. And not only selling out stadiums but putting on a kick ass show NIGHT AFTER NIGHT

&#x200B;

So my point of all this is money and power is definitely a focal point of business in Nashville, which is a shame because it should always be about to music.

"So when I think of rappers that have to/have had to deal with the frequent leaking of their songs in recent times, I think of rappers like Carti, Uzi, and Juice. Then I suddenly remembered that Drake was in a similar position long ago. Thank Me Later, Take Care, and Nothing Was The Same all leaked like 1-2 weeks in advance 😭 before those tapes were officially dropped.

"Last night was an absolute dream. Honestly, part of me wonders if it was even real. Seeing Ed in the small venue was absolutely worth it. He performed the entirety of Subtract, and spoke about each song as a lead in. It’s clear this album means so much to him, and it just feels right to see him perform it in a more intimate venue.  Here’s the set list (to the best of my recollection, I was so in the moment). He played Subtract with a full band and strings, it was just beautiful. When he transitioned to his other songs, it was just Ed with his typical looper set up. If you are debating it, and can, you have to go to this show.

"For me personally, I could see I'm A Mess, Love Yourself, and Galway Girl being the first to go. Also the slots where Give Me Love, Lego House, Visiting Hours, Tenerife Sea, and I See Fire are rotated (like the 2 songs before the collaborations medley) get replaced with Subtract songs. Overpass Graffiti and maybe Sing have a dark horse potential to also be on the chopping block. Personally, I wish he removed the no. 6 collaboration slots (Blow and the medley) to add 2 more songs to the tour, but I dont think he will.

"Hello everyone! So I ordered all available photopholios from Weverse back in December. They are finally starting to arrive. Jungkook's arrived today and RM's, tomorrow. I live in an apartment and I work all day so I posted a note right on my door asking UPS to please toss/throw my package over the patio so it doesn't sit at the front door unattended. Well, my brother just checked for me and there is nothing in the patio. He checked everywhere around the apartment, the neighbors aren't home so he can't ask them, he even checked nearby apartments to see if there were packages at the front door and nothing. My theory is the either A. got stolen in the 10 minutes between when it was ""left at front door"" (as it says on the UPS tracking site and the Weverse app) and when my brother checked (I find this unlikely because it was such a small time frame and I've never gotten anything stolen from my front door) or it was delivered to the wrong address. I'll ask the neighbors once I get home and look around the patio myself. Anyways, my question is...is the refund process with Weverse a complicated one or is it like Amazon's? First time ever purchasing from Weverse so I have no experience. Have you all lost something from them? Thank you all for reading this and I'm just so upset since I don't have my JK photopholio yet and it's apparently lost!

"Post Malone - beerbongs & bentleys (5 Years Later)

Post Malone, after gaining traction for over a year with White Iverson, received his first brush of mainstream success with Congratulations ft. Quavo, which was one of the biggest hits of 2017 after months of climbing the charts. 8 months afterwards, with his Stoney album still increasing in sales, Post geared up to begin a new era — with the cloud trap hit Rockstar with 21 Savage. Before the album’s drop came another number 1 in Psycho (feat. Ty Dolla Sign), and the Fast & Furious soundtrack cut Candy Paint.

While the singles and album itself earned mixed reviews from critics, they were all enormous successes. Rockstar and Psycho became 2 of the biggest songs of 2018 & earn him multiple Grammy award nominations. Bolstered by features of Nicki Minaj, Swae Lee, G Eazy, and YG, the album became his first number one selling 461K first week. It achieved biggest streaming week ever with 431.3 million on-demand audio streams in the country at the time, surpassing the previous record held by Drake's More Life (2017), which started with 384.8 million. It finished the year as the 3rd most successful album. After releasing the Minaj collab Ball For Me as the 4th single, it’s video and eventual promotion was halted by the rising success of Better Now, a solo pop song that helped the album stay relevant for another year.

"Post military announcement of the remaining 4 members of BTS , I have seen quite a few ARMYs joking about how Jimin is too ""fragile"" for military. Even jokingly , I think having such an opinion on him is very weird . I mean guy is nearing 30 and can still do that high kick , he is no way fragile in any sense. He has the highest amount of experience with martial arts too.

This constant portrayal of him as the ""fragile"", the ""gay"" label he receives from some K-pop stans (lol the irony) and the thousands of ""sassy"" edits of him , combined with the unique kind of hate and the scrutiny , he , in particular receives from deranged shippers almost making him the ""other woman"" in the relationship , why do I feel that its a very caricature-ish image of him because he is deemed to be feminine? Even the hate for him is rooted in misogyny.The fact that so much ARMY produced content also perpetuates this image of him , and gets high amount of views and shapes the image in the minds of new fans. Its 2023 , Indian ARMYs STILL use the song ""character dheela"" (lose character)to make edits using his flirty clips from 2017.

I sometimes wonder we are seeing the same artist , because to me he comes across as an incredibly private individual who wants people to know him by his work than anything else. He potrays and carries himself like a gentleman. Has immense amount of discipline and keeps himself really fit. Works extremely hard and has a very healthy attitude towards life in general.

Almost all comebacks in K-pop follow the same routine: the group releases a single (that can be a part of an EP or album) -&gt; they promote it by performing it 3 days a week at different music shows for up to one month -&gt; they go on variety shows and do university festivals. The more established groups will go on a tour every few comebacks (usually SK, Japan and maybe US/SEA if the group is successful enough). And then rinse and repeat with a few occasional tweaks here and there. 

And some of my fellow blinks might not be happy that I'm saying this, but BTS is the most popular Korean musical act (by a significant margin) and starting from a couple years ago I have treated them more as a global pop act that happens to be from Korea rather than a K-pop group. In my mind they have been in the same category as the biggest stars in music (similar to how I don't really think about the fact that Bad Bunny is from Puerto Rico, or that Drake and Justin Bieber are from Canada, or that Harry Styles is from the UK - they all to me are just huge artists). I'm an Asian-American so this take might be really US-centric from me, but it's also not a secret that US market is the largest one in the world.

My point is that I don't expect BTS to perform the same songs 20 times on different music shows or to post a ton of variety content or to do fancalls - which all are normal things that I expect from K-pop groups. And even during 2020 and 2021 Blackpink still did exactly that: HYLT, Lovesick Girls performances at Inkigayo, Music Bank for etc. for weeks. Appearances at variety shows like Running Man and Knowing Bros. The promo for Rose's and Lisa's solos followed the same strategy (with some adjustments because of Covid). 

But Blackpink has been growing in popularity every year, and from my perspective in 2022 they finally became big enough to abandon the usual K-pop practices. They pre-recorded one Pink Venom and one Shut Down performances for Inkigayo, did VMAs, Jimmy Kimmel show and then dipped until their world tour. It's funny but the first time I mentally ""reclassified"" Blackpink's status in my head was when I saw Taylor freaking Swift, who's probably the biggest pop star in US right now, jamming and singing along to Pink Venom, a Korean song. And for me it's even clearer now taking into account the fact that they are selling out arenas and stadiums on four different continents and are rumored to headline Coachella. I have no idea if it's true or not, but just being in that conversation with Bad Bunny, Frank Ocean and other huge names is crazy to me. 

To summarize: while I believe that Blackpink has been the biggest K-pop girl group since at least 2019, for me personally the second half of 2022 is when they separated themselves from the K-pop field and elevated to the next level where only BTS was before. They are still significantly behind BTS in terms of overall popularity/impact across the globe, but I also think they are quite ahead of everyone else except BTS. This post is just my opinion, so feel free to disagree and I'd love to see what other K-pop fans think about all of this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/105urzj/a_few_years_ago_bts_outgrew_kpop_and_now_i_think/,"A few years ago BTS outgrew ""K-pop"" and now I think Blackpink did too.",kpopthoughts,t3_105urzj,/r/kpopthoughts/comments/105urzj/a_few_years_ago_bts_outgrew_kpop_and_now_i_think/,2023-01-07 17:41:57,BTS,0.25462922

"June 24 is a really special day for me, since 2 of the most fun and memorable songs were released simultaneously on the same day, and the 2 artists happened to be my 2 biggest favorites!

Some fun facts about the songs:

**""Left and Right"" - Charlie Puth (ft. JungKook of BTS)**

Charlie Puth originally teased this song as a solo track in February via TikTok. Two months later however, he tweeted about a dream where BTS featured on the song (which was received by waves of excitement from fans). And while the the whole group wasn't part of the song, Charlie was able to collaborate with one of his long time admirers, Jungkook!

Jung Kook extended his record for having the biggest single debut by a South Korean soloist on Spotify with Left and Right. The song recorded 6.792 million streams in its first day of release, debuting at no. 3 on the Spotify Global chart. The song also debuted at #22 on the Billboard Hot 100.

**POP! - Nayeon**

I had heard someone say this about the song - ""Pop put the pop back in K-pop"", and i couldn't agree more! The song's sound was a throwback to TWICE's amazing bubblegum pop era and it created a viral dance trend with its catchy hand choreography 👉🤚

Pop secured the #2 position on the Circle digital chart, #5 on the Billboard Japan Hot 100 and also achieved the prestigious triple crown at Inkigayo. Nayeon also became the first Korean soloist in history to debut in the top 10 of the Billboard 200 (at #7).

"Hope everyone is having a great day and that 2023 is off to a great start!

As someone who likes numbers, I started to track BTS' numbers and solo projects during the year, just to see where they would land and, given that in 2022, we had more solo releases/collabs/OSTs than OT7 songs, I decided it would be interesting to see how many streams they would get.

As a preface, songs that are not credited to BTS in their solo projects are not taken into consideration so to not double count (Jungkook's Left and Right and Dreamers are not considered under Jungkook's solo profile - only some remixes attributed to only him are).

Just to observe how their growth has been, here are their previous streaming years:

"In the exhilarating world of Forza Horizon 4, Drake found himself in the midst of an intense game mode called ""The Eliminator."" It was no ordinary race; it was a Battle Royale-style competition where 72 drivers vied to become the last one standing, the ultimate Eliminator.

Drake had always been a car enthusiast, but this was a whole new level of excitement. His sleek, customized sports car, a powerful Lamborghini, roared to life as the countdown began. Drake couldn't help but feel the adrenaline pumping through his veins. He knew that strategy and speed would be his allies in this high-stakes battle.

As the game progressed, Drake navigated the ever-changing terrain of the English countryside. He engaged in intense Head-to-Head races, using his driving skills and quick thinking to eliminate opponents one by one. The thrill of the chase and the rush of victory spurred him on.

As the competition dwindled, Drake found himself in the top ten. The final showdown, a heart-pounding race, was within reach. His Lamborghini had been through countless upgrades and modifications, making it a formidable force on the track. It was time to give it a fitting name: ""The Eliminator.""

The final race was set against the backdrop of Edinburgh's historic streets. Drake knew this was his moment. His car revved, the engine's roar echoing off the cobblestone streets. The Eliminator had become a legend in the world of Forza Horizon 4, and Drake was determined to claim that title.

The race began, and the remaining drivers tore through the cityscape, battling for supremacy. Drake's skillful maneuvers and calculated risks allowed him to inch closer to victory. He eliminated his rivals one by one, their cars left in his rearview mirror.

As Drake crossed the finish line, he couldn't contain his excitement. He had become the Eliminator, the last driver standing in a grueling competition of speed and strategy. His Lamborghini, The Eliminator, stood triumphant in the heart of Edinburgh.

But Drake was not just a winner; he was a sportsman. He knew that victory was sweeter when shared. So, he decided to celebrate his remarkable win in style. He organized a virtual gathering with all the racers he had competed against, inviting them to a digital afterparty.

In the post-Eliminator celebration, Drake congratulated his fellow racers, exchanged stories, and shared tips on their favorite cars and customizations. It was a virtual car enthusiast's paradise, with players from around the world coming together to celebrate their shared love for The Eliminator game mode.

As the night went on, Drake and his fellow racers reveled in their shared passion for Forza Horizon 4 and the thrilling world of The Eliminator. It was a victory celebration like no other, uniting gamers in the joy of competition and camaraderie.

And so, in the digital realm of Forza Horizon 4, Drake proved that he was not only a talented musician but also a formidable racer, and his celebration of victory in The Eliminator became the stuff of legends in the gaming world.",https://i.redd.it/6uakqf9anvob1.jpg,Drake the type of car enthusiast to celebrate his win on the Eliminator in Forza Horizon,DrakeTheType,t3_16lbi5i,/r/DrakeTheType/comments/16lbi5i/drake_the_type_of_car_enthusiast_to_celebrate_his/,2023-09-17 20:39:59,Drake,0.09481675

"I posted a bit ago about how I listened to Harry’s House and fell in love with the album and of course Harry. 

Well, I finally was able to listen to Fine Line. So far I’ve listened to it about 4 times. 

Wow.

Wow.

Wow.

What a great album! I’m torn between which I like better, Harry’s House or Fine Line?! I found Fine Line to be a bit more moodier which I absolutely love. His lyrics are stronger in Harry’s House but the production is so smooth in Fine Line. His voice is angelic and I get lost in what I’m listening to. 

The stand outs on Fine Line for me are:

Golden
Cherry (my favourite track at the moment)
Sunflower, Vol. 6 (Harry’s best) 
Adore You (I’ve heard this song before and had no idea he sang it!)

I also had no idea he sang Watermelon Sugar - I call that the TikTok song cause that’s where I know it from, what a great song and I look forward to blasting it in the summer on a nice hot day. 

I’m glad to be adding this album to my summer soundtrack series.

Every track is amazing. No skips whatsoever. 

Again, I’m so glad I decided to give him a listen and I’m looking forward to listening to his debut at some point.

"Today, I saw a couple of posts on reddit that kind of rubbed me the wrong way. Basically both posts were talking about Jungkook's recent live where he was kinda tipsy/drunk and saying random things, and he said something about how he has to ""think of ARMYs whenever \[he\] does anything"" and that ""even breathing now is just thanks to ARMY"".

The posts themselves weren't exactly malicious (at least, I don't think they're malicious), but some of the comments really rubbed me the wrong way. In response to what Jungkook said about ARMYs, a lot of people were making speculations about Jungkook's mental health, ranging from diagnosing him with imposter syndrome to saying that he's too deep into the parasocial relationship with ARMYs and it'll come back to bite him in the ass one day. They were also talking about how harmful and unhealthy parasocial relationships were, which to me is a touch ironic because nothing screams parasocial relationship more than diagnosing a stranger with a multitude of mental health problems.

There is nothing wrong with being concerned about your favourite idols. There's nothing wrong with thinking there might be something off. But none of us actually know Jungkook personally. We aren't his bandmates, we aren't his mom and dad... we don't know him. We don't know what exactly is going on in his life or what's going on in his head (and he is by no means obligated to share that with us). It's a bit invasive to make all sorts of speculations about what he might be going through right now. Because we just don't know. Honestly, some of the people commenting under those posts are treating him almost like a book/movie character with a tragic backstory, rather than a real life human being who has boundaries that should be respected. Analyse, hell, overanalyse a book/movie character all you want. Talk endlessly about how their backstory has led to them becoming the way they are. But when it comes to real life people, it comes off as... dehumanising? To start psychoanalysing them the minute they don't have a smile on their face, the minute they start acting slightly differently to what you're used to.

And imo this kinda feeds into this whole parasocial thing with kpop idols. Kpop idols are human beings and it's inevitable that they will have off-days/days where they aren't feeling their best. Psychoanalysing kpop idols when they aren't ""on"" AKA when their current behaviour doesn't match the persona you usually associate with them only further perpetuates the whole ""perfect robotic idol"" thing.

I'm not saying by any means that it's impossible for Jungkook to not have some things going on right now. I'm not saying that Jungkook has never been affected by becoming an idol trainee at 13 and debuting at 15-16 years old. I don't know for sure though. We don't know for sure whether anything's happened to him. He's said nothing about this, so it's not really fair to start making assumptions about his current mental state. It won't do any good to spread any rumours about him.

Another problem with the psychoanalysing is all the stereotypes about people with mental illnesses it perpetuates, but that's a convo for another day. Or maybe we can talk about it here too.

I'm sorry if I dampened the mood around here, I know it's been an extremely exciting few days with all the stuff the Tannies are getting up to. It's just... the comments made me very uncomfortable. And I needed to talk about it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/bts7/comments/10sg9xe/to_speculate_or_not_to_speculate/,To Speculate or Not to Speculate?,bts7,t3_10sg9xe,/r/bts7/comments/10sg9xe/to_speculate_or_not_to_speculate/,2023-02-03 09:31:11,BTS,0.28425202

Has anyone ever noticed how there are a lot of memes of Ed? Regardless of if I’m looking up memes (in general) or just random photos of him either to practice editing photos (because he’s super photogenic in my opinion) I’m bombarded with a bunch. Some are funny of course but some are kind of brutal here’s a few examples on both sides of that,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/15ycqpm,Ed Memes Discussion,EdSheeran,t3_15ycqpm,/r/EdSheeran/comments/15ycqpm/ed_memes_discussion/,2023-08-22 17:35:56,Ed Sheeran,0.19893374
"BTS was my first introduction to K-pop (DNA in particular) and since DNA I’ve considered myself an ARMY. I was obsessed with them, every conversation I’d have with my parents was about them, I’d constantly watch those funny edits on YouTube and I saw them live in London in 2019 which was also my first ever music concert in general. Even years after that I was still as obsessed. If covid hadn’t happened, I would have gone to another of their concerts over here. 

I can’t really say that my love for them is the same anymore. I still buy myself one of their albums every year for my birthday and I have all my posters up and most of my profile pictures online is Yoongi. But I’m not streaming their music all that much or watching old Run BTS episodes or funny edits like I used to. I think it’s been this way since around 2021. I listen to so much K-pop everyday but BTS rarely shows up in my playlists. And if they do, it’s not even BTS themselves, it’s Yoongi’s solo Agust D music (which I still thoroughly enjoy). 

I was a pretty late bloomer with BTS’ old music, and I didn’t start listening to albums before LY era way into my time of being an ARMY. I remember distinctly that they performed Silver Spoon at the 2019 concert and I didn’t know what that song was because I was a music video sorta fan and the only albums I had at that point were LY Tear and MOTS Persona so I knew the songs from those albums too. But once I found their old stuff, I preferred it immediately to their new music. And it’s not like I found BTS at their debut. I became an ARMY in late 2018. And I still prefer the old music. Maybe that’s why I just have lost interest in them. 

I don’t mean to hate on any of the members, but I only briefly listened to their recent solo music and tbh I haven’t even listened to Tae’s songs. I’m just not interested anymore I guess. And I don’t think I can consider myself an ARMY since I really only listen to Yoongi’s solo music on repeat. 

When they return from the military, you can bet I’m seeing them live again.

10. The War On Drugs - Lost In The Dream

&#x200B;

Would love to hear others expand on specific tracks on this album. Please let me know what you think!

&#x200B;

1. No Tellin' - 1&2 are a toss up. both have phenominal production. The outro probably makes it #1 for me, it puts you in a trance. Lyrically my favorite track too. So braggadocious.
2. Star67  - vibes. just such a cool song. Great production, love how the song switches up. Really interesting samples.
3. Company -  love the switch up, Travis's part is too good. I wish I could hear it for the first time again. One of my favorite Travis verse of all time. This track really caps off the sinister vibe of the album. I do like Drake's half of the song, he painted the picture and set Travis up for such a dark horny verse. One of the lowkey horniest songs of all time but it's not so obvious and no one has ever made a song that's only about sex in this manner. It's like Dr. Jekyl and Mr Hyde.
4. Preach/WednesdayNightInterlude - was always my go-to tracks driving around late night, nostalgic for me. I feel it's way too underrated. I've seen people say it doesn't belong on the project, but I disagree. It adds so much to the overall atmosphere and that dark sinister feel. Its a nice break from all the heat in the songs beforehand. Treat it like its one track, not two. Its an artistic masterpiece. shout out PARTYNEXTDOOR, and Drake for having good taste and including it on this album. If this is always a skip for you, please explain why. I don't get it.
5. Know Yourself - classic Drake beat, great pacing
6. Legend - aged well. love the beat and production.
7. 10 Bands - originally my favorite of this album, still love it but the longer tracks are better overall
8. Energy - worst of the bangers. Still great.
9. 6PM In New York - oh you gotta love it. love it as an outro track.
10. Now & Forever - shout out Eric Dingus. Not much to say about it, boring lyrics but sounds great.
11. 6 Man - really fucking cool production, that elastic sound at 1:36 is nice
12. Jungle - cool production, too slow to be higher, I know a lot of people rate it highly, but I prefer Drake rapping.
13. Used To - its gone take some getting used to maaaaaaaaiiin
14. 6 God - too hard for this album, but goes off for sure. 
15. You & The 6 - says Mama too much
16. Madonna - only skippable track

&#x200B;

I would cut 13-16 and rearrange the order like this:

Legend

Energy

10 Bands

6 Man

Know Yourself

No Tellin'

Preach

Wednesday Night Interlude

Now & Forever

Company

Jungle

6PM In New York

"Subtract Tour PIT at Shrine Auditorium & Expo Hall in Los Angeles, CA.

Ed came into the audience with a hidden choir for an intimate first performance of the upcoming ‘Head > Heels’ from AUTUMN VARIATIONS!

He mentioned he had this idea of the choir being hidden in the audience (flash mob style) for Santa Clara’s ‘Subtract’ show last week, but members came down with COVID, and it couldn’t be done. Hoping they’re all doing great now!

"so with benito’s new album coming out soon, i thought of some people he could make songs with that would break the internet:
1. shakira - this would be ironic for shakira to do cuz her music is more focused on piqué’s infidelity, but a collab with these two would do bigger numbers than tqg and i could easily see being a chart topper
2. kali uchis - she seems to be moving more towards reggaetón recently given her dropping muñekita and her hinting at a new spanish album. i’m surprised they haven’t collabed yet but i think they would make a good duo with benito rapping and kali’s vocals
3. tokischa - they already performed together at some of benito’s concerts for uvst. i think she just has that infectious energy that would go great with benito’s melodic vocals and rapping
4. ozuna - they need to do a collab eventually of just them two. it would also have huge hit potential
5. feid - these two absolutely need to make a song together. bad being at the top of the game and feid being the fastest rising newcomer. this would also have huge hit potential
6. peso pluma - they don’t seem to be beefing anymore, so they should team up and make a song to show the whole world they’re cool. plus this would be another chart topping song imo

"about 4 years ago i got diagnosed with depression, i got put on antidepressants when i asked and tried to kill myself within a week of using them. no one knew about what i did that night until my mum saw me walking with a bit of limp the next morning (my muscles were fucked at the time) and called an ambulance. from the hospital i got sent to a mental hospital for 2 nights, after that i went to school and everything went back to normal ig.

of course i had ups and downs from then but late last year and the beginning of this one was probably a time period where my mental health was at its peak. but now, it’s all going down again. i feel like i felt before even starting therapy and i don’t know how to ask for help. my family thinks i’m doing all better, ive got different friends now and we rarely talk about mental health issues, and i’m not 18 yet so i can’t go to a therapist myself. i feel like self harming again and starving myself. 

the worst part is that my depression developed from undiagnosed autism (diagnosed now👍) and my parents don’t know shit about autism so they don’t listen to me when i’m overstimulated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/157vvn1/its_getting_worse_again_big_tw_for_sh_suicide/,"it’s getting worse again (big tw for sh, suicide attempt and ed)",teenagers,t5_2rjli,/r/teenagers/comments/157vvn1/its_getting_worse_again_big_tw_for_sh_suicide/,2023-07-24 01:03:20,Ed Sheeran,0.4269174

"I just found out that my current license plate costs me $40 a year in annual fees (it's a provincial parks plate, $5 of the annual fee goes towards park maintenance), which is the same cost as a custom vanity plate ($100 application fee + $40 annual fee). So I've decided to get BTS related plates. 

This will also force me to keep my car clean at all times, can't drag their names down LOL

On the local roads here I've seen these ones, so I wont be able to apply for them:

BTS, BTS 1, BTS OT7 

Our provincial plates allows 6 letters (7 including a dash or space). CAN NOT be numbers only (so no 134340). 

I'm OT7, Yoongi bias, Jimin bias-wrecker

My ideas are:

RUN BTS

BTS 613

2-3 BTS

AGUST D

SUGA 93

YOONGI

DDAENG

SUGA JM

Please share any more ideas, or what you have seen on your local roads!

"Here is a recap of the amazing 10 year journey this album has taken. Makes it feel like a myth that we finally get to hear.

-Subtract was originally supposed to be his second album following Plus.

-Tenerife Sea &amp; Bloodstream &amp; One were originally written for Subtract before the first Subtract turned into Multiply.

-For 10 years Ed kept putting songs he wrote on Subtract along the way trying to make it a perfect 10 song acoustic album.

-First Times &amp; Afterglow from Equals were on the second Subtract before the two albums switched places and Equals was released first. And there is a third song that was meant for Equals that Ed said ”would have been the biggest song on Equals” that was taken out and put on the second Subtract but that didn’t then make the third Subtract.

-After the release of Equals the already finished second Subtract that he wrote for 10 years was scrapped and re-written in just two weeks to be the third and final version of Subtract. 

-Eyes Closed was originally for No.6 Collaborations Project but was re-produced and re-written for Subtract.

-The Hills of Aberfeldy was originally for Multiply.",https://www.reddit.com/r/EdSheeran/comments/120fvpo/subtract_feels_so_mythical/,Subtract feels so mythical,EdSheeran,t3_120fvpo,/r/EdSheeran/comments/120fvpo/subtract_feels_so_mythical/,2023-03-24 10:12:58,Ed Sheeran,0.10175867

I think they should take time with planning and stuff .. and tread carefully by proof testing and all .

Coz even for TCT .. they used features to attract masses on singles .. which were good but CLEARLY DOESN’T EVEN SHOWS OR GIVE A GLIMPSE OF WHAT TCT IS

"If you'd asked me on that Festa dinner night last June where will Bangtan boys go with their new chapter, my answer probably be totally different from the reality we see today. The members are THRIVING, absolutely living their best lives. I don't personally know them but I know about their struggles from a fan's perspective, I know the kind of remarks they faced in past few years and to finally seeing them coming to be such a great artists is absolutely a treat. I am just so proud of them. 💜

I know many ARMYs probably are not active after Festa, many left the fandom, but it was opposite for me, I became more active after the festa and i don't regret it a bit even though some uncertainty is still there (Enlistment and stuffs). But the bigger picture is still very beautiful.

For jungkook to collaborate with an artist he wanted to collab before, Charlie puth and then he went on to perform on FIFA World Cup! That still sounds like a fever dream tbh. My man also deleted his IG recently in a true JK fashion, but he did promised to do more weverse lives so we won at the end. It looks like he is currently just enjoying and resting but ik, the moment JJK1 drops, it's over.

For Jin to have a song with his favourite band, Coldplay and then finally be able to sing that in front of 70K crowd in Argentina! Wow. Not only that, he sold 1M+ copies as a soloist and did amazing on multiple platforms. You can now see his face everywhere on JIN Ramen lmao.

Taehyung seems to be doing what he loves as well, from attending fashion shows then to spend time with his close friends, Wooga squad on SOOP and then currently airing a cooking show!!! He seems really happy these days :-) 

Jimin finally collaborating with someone he looked up to, Taeyang and he is now going to release his very anticipated debut album 'FACE'. Though he was less active in 2022, I can feel 2023 will be Jimin's year.  He also ventured into fashion world by becoming GA for not one but two huge brands, DIOR and Tiffany &amp; Co. And looks like he is now tapping into tiktok as well.

What do you mean jhope went from dancing to jcole songs to dancing to J Cole's verse ON HIS SONG! My mind is still processing this. Hope world finally met Cole world and what a universe they create, immaculate. He also released his very critically acclaimed album 'Jack in the box' last year. He also took a huge risk with that album, not only in terms of the sound but he totally diverged from kpop route of promotions and other things. Oh, he also headlined Lollapalooza And attended 3 shows during PWF, finally capping it off by becoming GA for Louis Vuitton and released a Collab with Crush and performed on NYRE. You can see the growth in jhope very clearly. I am gonna miss this man so much.

RM is already working on his 2nd album while he just released his first album in Dec. Looks like he is literally living in BH building. You can tell how much 'Indigo' meant to him by the way he speaks about the album. He also broke multiple records and then went on to perform in front of 200 very lucky ARMYs. Though, Indigo promotion period was small, it was very special and meant lot to both ARMYs and RM. He also recently attended Milan fashion week for 'Bottega Vanetta'. Members are killing the fashion game as well. 

And what do you mean Suga is going on a world tour??? 😭😭😭😭 My jaw hit the floor when I got that news. Good for him good for him. I can totally see him filling out stadiums tbh. Or any members. He also snatched a brand 'Valentino' and became their GA :-)) his album might be released soon too, probably before end of April. 

They also did many more things I might have forgot.

"There's  been a long ongoing discussion about whether idols should be allowed to  debut as minor which I've been following without getting too involved  so far because my opinion on the issue is pretty straightforward (they  shouldn't). However, a pattern that I've noticed in those discussions  and that has been irking me a lot is that people often bring up Jungkook  as an example of an idol debuting young and still achieving success  (""Well JK debuted at 15 and look at him now!"" sort of arguments), which  admittedly could convince non-fans, but I think BTS fans should know  better and I felt like bringing some facts to the discussion.

First,  I often see the argument that JK doesn't actually regret debuting young  because he says that he's happy he debuted with BTS. Now I do not know  exactly how Jungkook feels about starting to work at 15, as I'm not  inside his head and it's not a topic he often addresses willingly, but I  know that he did [agree that he started working too young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxRsoqzvJuQ)  (@0:48, turn subtitles on) when asked on a variety show, and that he wrote a whole song about [growing up too fast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTh7DIOfd1w)  and feeling inadequately adjusted when comparing his life to his peers.  He also often brings up how he wishes he had studied more and learned  more English, and feeling ""[slower](https://twitter.com/doolsetbangtan/status/1167853733809704960)""   than the other members because he wasn't schooled traditionally. A  quick reminder that Jungkook started training at 13, took a year off  middle school upon debut, and only attended high school sporadically  throughout the years.

I know that a  popular meme among ARMYs was that Jungkook lived à la Hannah Montana  and attended school by day and performed Blood Sweat and Tears sexily at  night. Tbh this image of JK's [HS uniform](https://twitter.com/jk_97oqol/status/1624714044396666880)  hanging backstage of used to make me laugh too, but looking back it's  less funny and more concerning. It's also worth noting that Jin, who was  only 18 at debut, also said that idols are debuting too young and that  JK used to miss his family in Busan so much during their trainee days  that he would invite him at his own house and for family gatherings so  that he would feel [less lonely](https://twitter.com/jinnieslamp/status/1083919666655817728/photo/1).

That  brings me to my second point: people arguing that he got lucky because,  even though he didn't have his parents around, he was still raised by  the rest of BTS. Now I'm not going to argue against that, he admits  himself that BTS played a huge part in his formative years and that he's  arguably a collection of all their personalities, but do y'all  seriously believe than living with a bunch of barely older teenagers is  the same as having your parents with you? The rest of maknae line was  only two years older than him, and they didn't even join until later in  his trainee life. He was a 13 y-o hanging out with a bunch of 17-18 y-o.  Now I'm sure that his members took good care of him, they adore him  that much is obvious, but no I don't think Jin packed his lunch and  drove him to school everyday. Mostly because JK probably didn't attend  school everyday, but also because Jin had his own things to do and was  in the process of growing up himself. We shouldn't brag about teenagers  ""raising"" younger teenagers.

And I  really don't like the way some people act like he had it better because  he was in BTS, or that he was lucky because Big Hit was somehow much  better than other management companies. JK was the center, main  vocalist, lead dancer and sub-rapper of the group at debut, that's a  whole lot of responsibility for a 15 y-o and it meant that he was at the  forefront when it comes to public opinion. Not only was BTS not that  popular at debut, they also faced very harsh criticisms and Yoongi   talked recently about how he couldn't even understand the amount of hate  they used to get at that time. JK was a teenager and ppl trended  articles about his acne, sometimes even [editing it](https://pannative.blogspot.com/2016/07/hul-is-this-for-real.html) to look worse than it was.

Some  ARMYs also seem to believe that Big Hit was better than the other  agencies, and that it's fine for Hybe and other attached labels to debut  minors. Now, I know that there are much worse companies but Hybe  certainly isn't without blame.  Again, don't want to get into details  but maknae line was in fact sexualized upon debut by having choreos with  hip thrusts and ""abs"" flash, which could have encouraged the fans who  had countdowns for the day he would turn ""legal"" and made overall  inappropriate comments.  We also have seen [reports of bad management](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/3w66id/bighit_entertainment_fires_manager_seen_raising/) with the manager who was fired for allegedly raising his hand at Jungkook, or the [prank they pulled on AHL](https://www.tiktok.com/@jn_vm/video/7039967752735427866) (ignore the cheesy edit). The one for his [16th birthday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yYD2GZdMxM) also leaves a very sour taste in my mouth  and it's something you shouldn't put children through for entertainment imo.

So no, Jungkook's success doesn't nullify the hardships he and the other  members went through, it doesn't make him debuting at 15 and being  sexualized on their first comeback retrospectively ok, and just because  he's satisfied with his life now doesn't mean that we shouldn't talk  about it. Stop using ""But Jungkook/Taemin/Jessica/X idol who debuted young is now successful"" as an argument because you want to see minors debut. No one is guaranteed success. In my opinion, teenagers are not mentally prepared to face this much scrutiny and it's fine if you disagree but don't drag other idols in this. Even though JK is obviously happy to have debuted with BTS and wouldn't trade it for anything, it doesn't mean that other young idols will achieve that kind of success or should even try until they're older.",https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/132s7s1/i_wish_people_would_stop_using_jungkook_as_an/,"I wish people would stop using Jungkook as an example of a ""success"" story for young idols",kpopthoughts,t3_132s7s1,/r/kpopthoughts/comments/132s7s1/i_wish_people_would_stop_using_jungkook_as_an/,2023-04-29 12:55:54,BTS,0.1537979

Hi everyone!

MY NEW PLATES!  [https://imgur.com/3PfsXVO](https://imgur.com/3PfsXVO)

Thank you to the /r/bts7 community for helping me decide on my BTS vanity plate!

""RUN BTS"" had a strong lead in the original thread, and thankfully I was able to get it! I also got a custom plate frame for the back of my car!

Now the question is, what custom plate frame should I get for the FRONT of the car?

Please help me decide!!!

Options:

a) Top: MAKE YOU MOVE; Bottom: LEFT AND RIGHT (RUN BTS song reference)

b) Top:  까르보나라; Bottom:  라지벌랄라 (Variety show Run BTS reference carabonara and  lachimolala)

c) Top: So Show me; Bottom: I'll Show You (Magic Shop song reference)

d) Other, please mention in the comments!

"Hey, so I recently realised that Seventeen’s FML album’s sales on Hanteo is more than Circle (by hundreds of thousands) which is kind of my first time ever seeing something like this because usually it’s the other way around.

I stand corrected, but my understanding is Circle chart reflects the number of albums in stock or have been pre-ordered/ordered; and Hanteo chart reflects the actual sales i.e albums which have been purchased on or off the counter.

Does that mean Seventeen sell more than what’s been ordered? But how’s that possible cause you need to order first before you make purchase. Or somehow someway sales are not being reported yet? But it’s been over a month since their comeback and it’s really weird to see their Hanteo sales still exceeding Circle. Appreciate any explanation!

"So it had been a pretty quiet 2022 for Jimin lovers apart from an OST he released and pretended it never happened. But apart from some people who were adamant Jimin was the member who would retire from the industry and open a remote dance school somewhere because of his disappearance from the public eye, there was excitement brewing with third party posts of him working tirelessly in the studio with a variety of producers that go from Tommy Brown who's worked with Ariana Grande to Hudson Mohawke who recently went viral for a very experimental track ""Cbat"". 

The general consensus then was that perhaps he was tirelessly working on an album and not necessarily interested in anything outside of that project. But now 2023 brings us Jimin collabing with Taeyang, followed by him becoming the *first* member in BTS who is now signed to be the Dior Global Ambassador *and* we get this announcement the same day as the announcement that he's releasing his first solo album in February! There is also buzz about him flying to the Paris Fashion Week in a few days! **And it has been only 15 days into 2023.**

There really isn't a middle ground with Jimin from the looks of it. Either you feel like you've been left on read by your s/o or you've been bombarded with countless thirst traps in a span of hours. Yes this analogy is deranged, and yes, I think it still works. 2023 is so exciting I really can't wait to see what else Jimin brings to us!",https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/10dba14/leave_it_to_jimin_to_make_a_comeback_with_album/,Leave it to Jimin to make a comeback with album AND Dior ambassador announcement at the same time.,kpopthoughts,t3_10dba14,/r/kpopthoughts/comments/10dba14/leave_it_to_jimin_to_make_a_comeback_with_album/,2023-01-16 10:32:28,BTS,0.10956833

"Ed Sheeran is all over the news right now with media after he won the court case. I am so glad he won, and I feel horrible about hearing he missed his grandmother's funeral.

With this album being centered on loss, grieving, depression, and challenges; partially fueled further by the Shape Of You court case last year - I can't help but notice the mirroring of what happened this week.

The first day of the Shape Of You court case, Ed's friend Shane Warne passed away, and now his grandmother (the grandmother that inspired 'Nancy Mulligan') passed away during his Thinking Out Loud trial.

I, for one, wish the album had more spotlight than this trial that wasted everyone's money, time, and emotions.

I feel sort of weird for saying this, but I hope that the trial outcome and publicity translates into something good for Ed and helps bring old fans back to his music and new ones to check it out. Specifically, I hope it at least helps Subtract. Ed stated in today's interview with Zane Lowe, he's a bit worried about ""getting ears to hear this album"" because there's no ""Shivers"" or ""Shape of You"" type song. With all the nightmare this trial brought, I hope it at least can translate into not just a win, but help bring those ears to listen to Subtract to celebrate Ed's victory and the victory of the music industry as a whole.",https://www.reddit.com/r/EdSheeran/comments/137xkzr/i_hope_the_publicity_of_the_trial_translates_into/,I hope the publicity of the trial translates into people listening to Subtract,EdSheeran,t3_137xkzr,/r/EdSheeran/comments/137xkzr/i_hope_the_publicity_of_the_trial_translates_into/,2023-05-04 19:39:23,Ed Sheeran,0.10913446

"I'm not sure if everyone is familiar with the recent Girl Math trend, but I saw someone do BTS math on [twitter](https://x.com/yoongiclip/status/1707101981301461108?s=20) and thought it might be fun for us to join in!

Basically girl math is justifying your purchases to make you feel better about it. Here's a kiwi radio host helping someone [justify their Taylor Swift tickets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGvvFg9b6Sk). I will be using this for the next BTS tour....

I thought we could expand this to BTS and army examples! It doesn't have to be exclusive to spending (but I'm guessing a lot of army examples may be)

Here's some examples:

* Army math is buying extra items to justify the shipping costs 
* Army math is remembering BTS' birthdays, but not your own friends/family members
* Army math is calculating time/comebacks by hair colour
* Army math is [everything is free if your bias pays for it](https://x.com/BE_Happier_BTS/status/1708287333378973813?s=20)
* BTS math is being so confident you're going to win BTS run and forgetting about Kim Seokjin - see the BTS mall episode where Jimin finished early and photo episode with JK smashing his board
* BTS math is raiding the pantry at ILand even thought you're a millionaire
* BTS math is betraying each other for hanwoo beef or other food (when you can easily afford it)
* BTS/army math is seeing 7 everywhere
* BTS math is having holograms and a snowgi so there's still 7 members on stage
* BTS math [is sitting on top of each other even though there's ample space](https://x.com/naija0329/status/1707228477231935581?s=20)",https://www.reddit.com/r/bts7/comments/16wx355/btsarmy_math/,BTS/Army Math,bts7,t3_16wx355,/r/bts7/comments/16wx355/btsarmy_math/,2023-10-01 09:55:52,BTS,0.077668175

He starts out by playing an airy ballad, “Magical,” from his second album with Dessner. “This is how it feels to be in love,” he sings. “This is magical.” Another Dessner song, a likely single, has a bright “Solsbury Hill” feel: “Saturday night is giving me a reason to rely on a strobe light,” he sings, amid more meditations on grief.

"Hello! I reached out to the mods/moderators/owner and made sure it was OK to post this:

My name is Hannah Wing, I am a Harry Styles fan and a researcher with Wichita State University’s Elliott School of Communication, and I am looking for adults (age 18 and over) for a research study on celebrities. I am looking for participants who identify as fans of a celebrity or celebrities to discuss their feelings towards and expectations of the celebrity. You can choose to talk about Harry Styles, or if there is someone else you are a bigger fan of, you could talk about them instead. 

If you agree to participate, you will be asked to participate in a private interview that will take up to 60 minutes. I will audiorecord or videorecord the interview depending on your preference. To participate, you will need a stable internet connection through a device that supports Zoom videoconferencing. (You can access Zoom through a browser link I send or by installing their free client.) You will need to be able to access this from a private, quiet place where you can speak to me freely without worrying about being overheard or interrupted.

 If you are interested in participating, please fill out this brief questionnaire:[https://wichitastate.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_bpxeHl7ZGGS2Xxs](https://wichitastate.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bpxeHl7ZGGS2Xxs) If you are eligible and I can fit you in, I will reach out to you within one to two weeks. (Please note I wish I had enough time to accommodate everyone, but it is likely I will not be able to invite everyone to participate.) If you have any questions about participation, please email Hannah Wing at [hannah.wing@wichita.edu](mailto:hannah.wing@wichita.edu) or message me here on reddit. I will also monitor this post, although I encourage you to contact me privately. I will update this post when I close recruitment.

"mine in middle school was really bad, they just showed as a picture of a dick and a video about puberty and gave up on doing anything more

in high school it was still pretty bad but better. one thing id give to them is that they really put an emphasis on consent, listening to your partner during sex and were really adamant on educating about sa

im still really disappointed that they didn't even explain different sexualities and such, that would have probably help me earlier this year in accepting myself. to be fair it wouldn't have gone well anyways since there is a worrying amount of closeted homophobes in my class

"Tuscan Leather is a good song that could be better if it was a bit shorter. I honestly think if it ended at the second verse it would be as good as you all say, but 6 minutes of Drake just rambling is his best track in many of your opinions? It is without a doubt his most overrated song. I see so many people glaze this song, yet it’s just a slow, randoms boring song. What do some of these lines even mean?? “Them strep throat flows” wow, bars! 

Drake is not a good rapper. Why do y’all fw him talking for 6 minutes? It’s so boring. Virginia Beach is objectively better. The beat is unique, the flow is different, it’s sonically better. It’s a better track but something about the nostalgia or the fact that Drake realized he’s a shit rapper and doesn’t do boring 6 minute ballads anymore makes you guys glaze this track every week on here.

"For context, I’m a slow and strategic worker and even before I started procrastinating I’ve always had a hard time getting work in on time, so in my IEP it gives me more time to work on assignments with the exception of Drivers Ed because “you won’t get accommodations on the road.” Ok?? I also won’t be turning in work on the road, so how does that correlate? Anyways, I studied hard for that class and aced every test, but I didn’t turn in 3 assignments on time which brought my grade down to a 60 since they were each 10% of my grade, and I need at least a 70% to pass. I failed. I’m so pissed! I understand all there is to know about the rules of the road, but I can’t drive because I’m a slow worker. Those with an IEP can retake it for free, but I’ll have to replace Health, my ONE class I have with my friend with Driver’s Ed, which means I’ll probably never see them again. I’m not allowed to see them outside of class because my parents don’t like them and I only have the same lunch as them when lunch is over Health for both of us. And I’m switching schools next year.

"Happy Wednesday, r/bts7! 💜 This week, we’re trialling something new - Would You Rather Wednesday. 

**It’s simple: leave your WYDs down below in the comments and then let others leave their reasons of what they’d rather.** 

The classic example is, would you rather 5 x Jungkook or a 5-year old Jungkook? But your WYD can be song-related, content-related or absolutely whack. For example:

* Would you rather be in an episode of Bon Voyage or In The Soop?
* Would you rather have BTS *finally* perform Paradise or Louder Than Bombs?
* Would you rather go for a bicycle ride on a super hot and humid day with Namjoon or have a 3 hour gym session with Jungkook where he goes all out?
* Would you rather metal concept Bangtan or country concept Bangtan?
* Would you rather have a sneak peak into the Genius Lab and listen to unreleased songs or have a sneak peak at Hopefilm and see pictures from over the years?

The more silly, lighthearted and absolutely abstract, the better. Plenty of links to evidence is highly encouraged!

But again I wanna point out how Drake uses less auto toon than Travis but he is still more replicatable. 1) he has enough music out there for study. 2) 40 has the most sophisticated pitch correction man. It's like the AI copied his whole flow.

"I feel like the only co-ed group people can think of is kard, and they're still somehow not very successful - or, at least, not as successful as you would except them to be, given that they are basically the only mainstream kpop group with this kind of unique line up. 

I feel like the reason why kard can't make the most out of their potential (aside from their music, which I personally don't really vibe with) is because of their imbalanced roles and line distribution. Both male members are rappers and many of their songs feel like girl group songs with a male rapper feature, in my opinion.

So i think it would be interesting to have a new, fresh, fourth-gen co-ed group, possibly even from a big 4 company (and, ideally, with all members over the age of 18). In my mind a good idea would be a 6 member group, 3 boys and 3 girls, with at least one male and one female vocalist and one male and one female rapper. Their concepts could range from more feminine to more masculine, but i'm sure all members would fit in and make it special.

"This is my interpretation of Post Malone’s 2nd album, Beerbongs & Bentleys. I custom-ordered the way the songs are placed. This is to make the album story more linear and better to understand, at least for myself. lmk what you think!

&#x200B;

1. **Notice Me**
   1. Although this Migos song is not part of B&B, I think it fits into the story very well. In this song, Post Malone & his friends are getting ready to pull up at a party. They are putting on their most expensive jewelry, designer pants, Gucci glasses, just to be noticed. They are dressing to impress.
2. **Psycho**
   1. PM is on his way to the party, knowing full well that he is fashionably well-equipped. He is just flexing his “crazy” aka really expensive & lavish AP watch. He is essentially stunting.
3. **Taking Shots**
   1. The PM and his friends are in the middle of the party. They are taking shots, playing beer pong, having fun, with cocaine, alcohol and other illicit drugs on the table. “Drunk when I walked in the door, So fucking high like, hello”. He is having the time of his life.
4. **rockstar**
   1. Here is when the PM is at his most high on drugs. He is cross-faded, with weed & alcohol. At this point, he does not care about his actions nor cares about the consequences “”Cocaine on the table, liquor pouring’, dont give a damn”. PM is making out with a girl in the middle of the party. With no care in the world and popping pills, he & his friends are quite in fact, “rockstars”. 
5. **Over Now**
   1. Having the time of his life, feeling great, he believes that he does not need a girl by his side. He looks back at the girl he was heart-broken over. He firmly believes that his past relationship with her is over now. “Felt like ballin’ was the only thing to do, Trade my women for some diamonds and a coupe”. He looks back at his regrets and opportunities he missed. The girl he once loved is traded for some demons and a car, expressing that these materialistic things are valued much more than her.
6. **Spoil My Night**
   1. PM and his friends continue to party. At this point, things are cooling down. He is riding down the high gradually, but is still feeling euphoric. Nothing much here, just guys having fun.
7. **Zach and Codeine**
   1. The PM keeps drinking & living life fast. Post continues to be unknowingly numb, taking anything to continue the high. He also doesn't want nobody to bother him; he is at a point of a high where he cannot be interacted with. Interestingly enough, he becomes a bit self-centered, selfish and unhumble, “I hit number one and I didnt even hit my peak”. Understanding what he went through, Post needed some confirmation that he is that, and that all the hard work he put in was not a waste. 
8. **Ball For Me**
   1. This song sounds sweet, quite flirtatious, possibly talking about some girl he met at the party. “I got too much on my mind right now” reflects his attitude towards materialism. He has lots of money to purchase designer purses for the women at the party that showed even a short amount of affection. Perhaps his mind is telling him something that’s more deep. 
9. **Rich & Sad**
   1. As the high comes to a close, the PM does not feel euphoric anymore, rather some emptiness. As incredible as the high was, he must be brought down. The high went down more than it needed to, since Post took a lot of drugs. His mind did not know which limit to reach while the coming down part of a euphoric experience. The drugs, women & diamonds were just a temporary fix, filling his broken heart. Post thinks that he needs someone by his side, when he comes down. He has all this money in the world, but no one to share it with. Point of this song is what is the point of being wealthy when you cannot spend it with your significant partner? Post also reflects that he would rather lose his money to be with his ex. He could have fucked the girls he met at the party, but it was “only lust”. He recognizes that his ex was special, and still is. Post feels regretful.
10. **Stay**
   1. All Post wants is for his ex to stay. Simply as that. He discusses that despites the arguments with his ex, he still cares about her. 
11. **Blame It On Me**
   1. At this point, Post Malone is at his lowest point. The only way for his ex to come back is for Post to believe that all his fault is on him. Blinded and broken, Post wants nothing more than his partner. He becomes irrational and angry, almost to the point where it causes his psychological damage, pain and trauma. 
12. **Otherside**
   1. Post does not recognize that his time with his girl is actually over. Deep down, he knows this, but refuses to believe it. 
13. **Paranoid**
   1. Between his uncertainty with his future with his ex, and the mixture of illicit drugs creating false narratives, PM is paranoid. He has way too much on his mind, and in his body. During the beginning of the party, he seeks out to find relief, or some form of artificial closure with his ex. Drugs and alcohol is a double-edged sword; it makes you not remember things, but also makes those memories far greater when surfaced. 
14. **Jonestown (Interlude)**
   1. Post Malone is currently experiencing an ego death, a euphoric and psychedelic under-changing of one’s self. He reflects back on his life, mistakes, people, and himself. The pressure is too much to cool off.
15. **Better Now**
   1. After his horrendous, yet unregretful ego death, PM feels better now. He recognizes he has done everything he could, and also recognizes that there was nothing left to do. It is what it is. He moves on, with a warm, yet broken smile. 
16. **Candy Paint**
   1. PM realizes that he can also stunt and be happy at the same time. 
17. **Sugar Wraith**
   1. Post is continues to be happy.
18. **92 Explorer** 
   1. PM is having fun with his true self. He “explores” internally and externally; finding himself and meeting new people. 
19. **Tommy Lee**
   1. PM becomes different, but is still Post Malone, like being the PM he was supposed to be all along. He learns that he doesn't need alcohol or drugs or women to have fun, he can have fun by being himself.

"Is there anyone on the thread who really loves the album? So far I’ve listened 3 times and I really do love it. I’ve seen pretty mixed reviews and I just wanted to put this out there. For me I’ve been a fan of Ed since his plus album, I’ve loved each album in their own way and they have seemed to come at the perfect time for me. Every album brings a memory back to me and they’re always there for comfort during the hard times. For those who are disappointed, please give it some time. Maybe you’re not in the situation where the album really relates. I love when musicians make music not just to be big pop hits but where their audience can relate and really have an emotional attachment to the music. When subtract initially came out, I wasn’t in the emotional place where I needed it the album but now I love the album and it’s helped me through some hard times. I’m really proud and excited for Ed to have his own label and I love the album and I know this is only the beginning. I hope everyone who isn’t too keen on it gives it a chance, I’m sure at some point you’ll be able to relate to it🫶 definitely gives me some plus vibes and I’m here for it!

"Yes, it's that straightforward. I'm giving away two GA Floor tickets for the Houston concert on Saturday. Was hoping to sell them, but I'll use the opportunity to cross off a bucket list item... give event tickets to a stranger. In my mind, I'd gift less expensive tickets... but here we are.

Post a comment below if you want to be in the name selection.

If you know an Ed fan in Houston, have them add their name in, too!

Only requests...

1. You have someone to take or go with so the second ticket doesn't go to waste.
2. You let my wife and I scan you in at the entry gate (obviously go do your own thing once we scan you in... it's GA on the floor). I have four e-tickets. We are using two of them. Don't want to assume the worst of anyone... but it's the internet... and I'm not trying to send someone e-tickets so they can turn around and sell them for a quick buck. Hoping to help two more Ed fans experience him live!

On Friday, I'll draw a name from the comment section here and wherever else I post this.

"“Hey, Aubrey! Wanna play with Uno with me at lunch?” “Yeah sure!” “Awesome!” “Hey, where did you get that coat by the way?” His gal pal decided to wear her faux-fur coat to school today.  “Oh, my grandmother gave it to me. She visited my family all the way from Scotland!” Drake then puts his foot in his mouth by saying “It makes you look like a big, fluffy sheep!”  His gal pal looks visibly upset by this and walks away.  Drake is upset that his joke made her sad because he didn’t mean that disrespectfully.  He then asks his friend if she overreacted.  “Don’t worry about it, if you didn’t mean it in a rude way, you didn’t do anything wrong.”  Drake takes his advice but decides it isn’t helpful when she continues to be upset.  Drake then apologizes to her for what he said.  “That’s okay, Aubrey.  Maybe I did overreact a little.  I didn’t tell you this, but my grandmother is really sick and I’m worried this coat will be the last thing to remember her by.

"If you haven't seen recently, the latest post from Jungkook's Calvin Klein campaign is getting backlash because of the extreme way they edited his nose. [Post (1st image)](https://twitter.com/CalvinKlein/status/1697406427747193295). [Image.](https://imgur.com/kKo7lq7) I was honestly thinking this was one of the stronger brand campaigns for a Korean artist (I especially loved the styling choices), but this edit was like a bucket of cold water. 

I understand that retouching exists, but I can't help but get annoyed at such an obvious attempt to make his nose look smaller.  Between this and the whitewashing of every photo from magazines to Weverse official photos themselves, I'm just annoyed. I also hate the trend of fans putting photos of their favorite artist through the Remini filter which automatically tries to edit in double eyelids, whiter skin, etc., however, I get more frustrated when it comes from an official brand/the company's official content. I'm also annoyed at the fans hyping it up and not seeing anything off or wrong with the photo. It's also annoying that solo stans in particular will complain about their fave having 2 seconds less screentime but will hype up posts like this with obvious body editing.

I don't really have a solution because this sort of editing has existed since photography was a thing. Changing someone's nose, editing into photos thigh gaps, making someone's skin whiter, etc etc etc....I wish there was a way to change this practice, but I feel with filters becoming more available for the average consumer, this problem is only getting worse.",https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/169j32f/im_annoyed_with_the_retouching_of_jungkooks_nose/,I'm annoyed with the retouching of Jungkook's nose in the latest Calvin Klein ad,kpopthoughts,t3_169j32f,/r/kpopthoughts/comments/169j32f/im_annoyed_with_the_retouching_of_jungkooks_nose/,2023-09-04 05:25:41,BTS,0.2312681

"Happy Wednesday, r/bts7! 💜 This week, we’re trialling something new - Would You Rather Wednesday. 

**It’s simple: leave your WYDs down below in the comments and then let others leave their reasons of what they’d rather.** 

The classic example is, would you rather 5 x Jungkook or a 5-year old Jungkook? But your WYD can be song-related, content-related or absolutely whack. For example:

* Would you rather be in an episode of Bon Voyage or In The Soop?
* Would you rather have BTS *finally* perform Paradise or Louder Than Bombs?
* Would you rather go for a bicycle ride on a super hot and humid day with Namjoon or have a 3 hour gym session with Jungkook where he goes all out?
* Would you rather metal concept Bangtan or country concept Bangtan?
* Would you rather have a sneak peak into the Genius Lab and listen to unreleased songs or have a sneak peak at Hopefilm and see pictures from over the years?

The more silly, lighthearted and absolutely abstract, the better. Plenty of links to evidence is highly encouraged!

"fyi he a sub lurker. this is to you, metro. read and learn our frank thoughts of the bullshittery you doing lately.

let me first start that im no hater, metro literally is my #1 on spotify wrapped 2023. but his moves lately might make me reconsider streaming his stuff, and reevaluate him as both an artist and person.

for out of the loopers, yesterday he tweeted summin and deleted later disrespectful to drake. simply butthurt that Her Loss nominated for awards while his Hoes & Villains didnt. he blames it on “politics.” hes clearly acting childishly, an an insecure, sensitive and an arrogant wazzock. he disrespects drake clearly and not only him, even his atl homie, 21 savage ! does this man want no friends or what ?!

this isnt the first time he does this. justa few weeks ago he clowned his own fans urging for the pluto collab album, he captioned “mETro DrOp tHe aLbuM”. again, he *mocked* his own fans. 

let us not forget the kidzania moves he did, redropping thug’s last album with the “og” playlist and relocates drake’s intro somewhere else. and removing drake from trance. and drake exposing his ass being a snake gossiper with literal thots on more m’s track.

he is an egotistical snake who thinks hes genius just because he made an orchestra perform his Hoes & Villains. i mean give me 60k and i could make this happen for any crappy album out there. nothing is revolutionary about this. it didnt even get the shine he wanted, simply because it was meh.

he is now dragging pluto to a rabbit hole. pluto used to drop classix yearly, max. this dude in the name of a collab is “cooking” forever. and now his passive aggression towards drake & 21 could pull a nerve with pluto and make that whole collab squashed. 

metro needs to grow the fuck up. he’s falling off already, bnyx and the new folk are already taking his shaky throne.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Drizzy/comments/18aw179/metro_stop_disrespecting_drake_21_savage_grow_up/,"Metro, stop disrespecting Drake & 21 Savage.

his candor floored me, the performances peppered throughout are phenomenal 

i just hope we get more documentaries like this from the members in the future 

road to d-day lacked an, artificial feeling. it instead filled the time with the highlights of yoongi’s life his music, his freedom and his friends 

his production made me think he must totally be a genius, and i adore the way he connects current worldwide issues and his personal struggles in his lyrics

amygdala portion gave me incredible insight into the songs meaning

"Drake the type of dude that sometimes feels lonely coming home after a show to an empty house. The only company he has is his pet poodle named ""Otis."" He calls Otis over so he can pet him, but as he is petting Otis, he realizes he is missing something more. A partner perhaps? A wife? Drake shrugs it off and tells himself, ""Whatever it is I'm sure it'll come to me when the timings right."" All the sudden, Drake gets an idea. He puts his finger in the air and the sound of a lobby bell goes ""ding"" and a light bulb appears in the air above his head. ""I know what I'll do!"" Drake tells himself. He tells his dog, ""Now you wait right here Otis. Daddy's gonna be back real quick."" He returns with an unopened jar of Jif Creamy Peanut Butter. He tells Otis ""I'm back now boy it's alright"" as he slowly lowers his trousers and boxers. He then opens the jar of peanut butter and takes out a scoop with his fingers. Otis is getting excited at the smell of peanut butter, so he starts panting and salivating. Drake says to him,""Just you wait now Otie Boy,"" and winks at him. Drake slathers the peanut butter on his scrotum and proceeds to slowly rub it up his shaft, finally ending at the tip. He makes sure to get some on his booty as well. He sits on the couch, slouches back with his legs spead, and goes, ""Ok buddy come on."" Otis excitedly walks up to Drake, with his tail wagging, and starts licking up all of the precious peanut butter. The rest of the night is lost in a montage with romantic smooth jazz saxophone music and ends in the morning. Birds are chirping as the sun is making its first appearance of the day. Drake wakes up naked, covered in random patches of peanut butter with the jar sitting empty next to him, and Otis sleeping at his feet with his mouth covered in peanut butter. Drake looks around and sees Otis. ""That sure was fun last night, buddy,"" he tells Otis as he pets him. Then he smirks to himself, ""Huh. You really did have everything you ever needed all along, Drake... everything..."" And then he looks off into the distance, smiles, and the scene fades to black.

""Your mother works too hard to provide the family with nutritous meals every night and you WILL give her the courtesy of eating it!"" Just then, the hippo yawns loudly.

""AUBREYYYY! WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU DOING WITH THAT HIPPOPOTAMUS?!""  ""This is Mr. Moops.  He's my best friend.""  ""Aubrey, hippos are wild animals.  It cannot stay in the house!""  So Drake chains Mr. Moops in the backyard.  ""It can't stay there either.""  So Drake hides the hippo under the bed and says ""promise me you'll stay quiet?"" as he feeds him a whole watermelon.  The hippo eats it all in one bite and roars the loudest roar you've ever heard.  Drake's dad then storms upstairs and yells ""I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO GET RID OF THAT HIPPO!"" ""But, Dad, he loves it here.""  The hippo then eats all Drake's dad's clothes, exposing his white boxers with little pineapple prints on them.  ""THAT'S IT MISTER! KISS YOUR HIPPO GOODBYE!""  Drake's beloved hippo is never to be seen again.  Drake then becomes a despondent hermit with long, unkempt hair and tissie boxes on his feet.  ""I've had enough of this! I'm gonna find Mr. Moops!""  He disappears for weeks and Drake's parents place posters all across town in a desperate attempt to find him.  As Drake wanders around, a police car pulls up to him and says ""Hey. you."" ""...me?""

""Aubrey, dear, we've been looking all over for you! Don't ever scare us like that again!""  ""Where's Mr. Moops?""  ""We found him swimming in the public pool.  We've decided to let you keep him!  We dug a reservoir in our backyard so he can swim around!""  This would be spectacular news, if only for the fact this was all imagined by Drake.  In reality, Drake's dad says ""Son, hippos are wild animals.  We can't domesticate him.""  Drake is sad to hear this but understands.  ""He's probably happier in the wild.""  ""You won't be so happy when you see all the hippo dung you're cleaning up!"" He hands Drake a bucket and mop and says ""Get to work!"" A laugh track plays as an iris closes in.

"So there's this band that I've been a fan of for a very long time, theyre from Kazakhstan. Called Ninety One. If you'll view their last few video teasers called ""angst"" you will notice something immediately familiar about it. They make several direct references to BTS wings era teasers. Like, almost identical. I'm kinda torn because I love the band but I also love BTS and it doesn't feel quite right that they're doing the same storyline with just a few changes. And it's not just one or two teasers, it's all of them have references. Is this meant to be like a homage or did they think people wouldn't notice because maybe BTS fans wouldn't even know who Ninety One is? I have complicated thoughts. Just wanted to rant and maybe see if anyone else noticed this.",https://i.redd.it/erbanchc013b1.jpg,BTS inspired another band?,kpoppers,t3_13vswoy,/r/kpoppers/comments/13vswoy/bts_inspired_another_band/,2023-05-30 15:11:09,BTS,0.17805049

"* You CAN get pregnant the first time you have sex
* The pullout method is not reliable!
* You can still get pregnant if he doesn’t put it in and semen ends up near your vag, because SPERM CAN FUCKING SWIM.
* You can get pregnant on your period
* Douching your vagina after sex will never prevent pregnancy and vaginal douching is quite frankly a useless concept 
* Male condoms are only 98% effective against pregnancy, and using one isn’t guaranteed STI prevention
* Female condoms provide 95% effective pregnancy prevention but, like the male condom do not provide 100% sti prevention
* The oral combined pill is 98% effective, regulates periods, reduces risk of cancer in the ovaries, uterus and colon and fertility returns to normal whenever you stop taking them, however they are less effective if you are over 35, smoke or are overweight.
* The emergency contraceptive pill (Plan B/ Morning After) is a stronger version of the normal oral contraceptive pill and must be taken no more than 3-5 days after sex. It doesn’t provide STI prevention and may have some unpleasant side effects, mainly due to the high dosage needed for it to be effective. These include nausea, slight period irregularitie, low abdominal pain, headaches and vomiting. You can often find them for free at family planning clinics but when bought at a pharmacy they can be quite expensive. You should not use this as a regular form of contraception
* The most effective methods of contraception are; sterilisation, IUD, the contraceptive injection and the contraceptive implant",https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/15pgttb/bit_of_sex_ed_for_you_mainly_afabs/,Bit of sex ed for you (mainly AFABs),teenagers,t5_2rjli,/r/teenagers/comments/15pgttb/bit_of_sex_ed_for_you_mainly_afabs/,2023-08-12 21:56:30,Ed Sheeran,0.6027529

"So far only BTS members have cultural order of merit so only them can defer to enlist by age 30. This law has been made since end of 2020.

I saw some people took comparison with 2nd gen idols who enlisting by age 30,31. Fyi, thats old law. The latest law has changed to enlist by age 28 instead. Thats law started 2019. Thats also how BTS Law being created. Thats why some idols enlisting a bit late as they got in between of transition to new law. And its getting more stricter in recent years. I read that gov have being wanting 94line to enlist since 2022. Cant find the original article but this is the closest ([https://forum.allkpop.com/thread/82426-under-the-military-service-standards-act-those-born-in-1994-must-join-the-milita/](https://forum.allkpop.com/thread/82426-under-the-military-service-standards-act-those-born-in-1994-must-join-the-milita/))  i got. I saw alot of misinformations spreading around especially at pann. Some even thought BTS Law apply for all idols when its actually just for BTS members for a moment. Alot of people also got mixed up with old law that only applied to 2nd gen idols back then. Its has changed to age 28 now.

>However, as a result of the coverage, it was found that unlike her SM Entertainment stance, Kai's alternative service was not due to a change in the Military Manpower Administration regulations. **The Seoul Regional Military Manpower Administration spokesperson's office told the JTBC Enter News team on the 4th, ""There is no change in the regulations. The number of postponements of enlistment for both ordinary people and celebrities is a total of 5 times (within the range of 2 years)'. In addition, due to SM Entertainment's official position, it expressed regret that it was reported as if Kai's enlistment was suddenly decided due to a change in the Military Manpower Administration regulations.**

"Update about Drake's summer:

Drake's dad, disappointed, told him: ""Aubrey, what the hell? You are 39... I mean 17, and you act like you even graduated. You are obviously in high school, no one would take you seriously."" Drake then replied with sadness: ""Dad, I just wanted to work around you, because I love you."" His father then hugged him and told him: ""Aubrey, I love you too but you cannot fake a degree. Lucky you I was the employer."" Then he give Drake his phone and says: ""Son, you should look for a summer job that requires no skills, okay?"" Drake accepts to apply for a job at an amusement park as a cashier.

&#x200B;

Once they called for a job interview in the amusement park in question, he got there wearing a tuxedo and decided not to lie this time, not even about his age. He told them he was 39 and still living in his parents' house. Luckily, he got accepted as a cashier and was so busy, he ended-up spending only an hour per day on Roblox. At the end of the summer, he had $700 and bought clothes to impress his classmates.

"Man, let me tell y'all something, and I ain't even gonna cap right now. When we talk about the GOAT in the music game, you can't even mention that title without bringing up Drake. This dude has been at the top of the game for a hot minute, and I'm about to lay down the reasons why. Buckle up, cuz we about to dive deep into this. You know how hard it is to stay relevant in this ever-changing music industry? Mad hard. Artists come and go, dropping one or two bangers and then fading into the background. But not Drake. This man has been serving us hits since before '09 . Ain’t no capping when I say Drake's been the North Star in the hip-hop universe. Consistency? Check. Bangers? Check. Emotionally charged anthems that have us all up in our feels? Double check. This man didn’t just pop up overnight. We’re talking about someone who's been crafting and shaping the music scene for over a decade. Every album he drops is like an era in itself, an imprint on our generation's soundtrack. And it's not like he's just dropping catchy hooks; he's telling stories, sharing experiences, and painting pictures with his words. It’s poetry, man. Pure sonic poetry. Now, think about all the summer nights cruising with the crew, or those late-night introspective moments. What's playing in the background? It's probably a Drake track. ""Started From the Bottom,"" ""One Dance,"" ""Passionfruit""... these tracks are more than just songs; they're memories, they're vibes, they're emotions bottled up into verses and beats. And speaking of beats, let's not even get started on how Drake manages to consistently collaborate with the best producers in the game. 40, Murda Beatz, Metro Boomin' – these legends lay down the canvas, and Drizzy paints masterpieces every time. Their chemistry is like Jordan and Pippen on the court, unmatched and always in sync. Drake's versatility is unmatched. Dude can rap, sing, dance, and even act (y'all remember him from Degrassi?). Whether he's giving us that deep emotional stuff or just vibing with a summer banger, he knows how to cater to his audience. He's not just a rapper; he's a damn artist. And let's be honest, his flows and lyrics are SICK. Who else can spit bars that make you think, make you cry, and make you turn up all at the same time?  


Diving into ""For All The Dogs"", this album isn't just another notch on his belt; it's an evolution. It's like he’s unlocked a new level in the game. Each track is a journey, a mood, an atmosphere. He's reflecting, celebrating, lamenting, and straight vibing. When he raps, you can hear the hunger, the passion, the fire. And when he sings? Man, it's like he’s serenading the soul. It’s ethereal. The tracks in this album, though? Straight gems. We're talking about anthems that'll be played at parties, weddings, late-night drives, and everywhere in between for years to come. And the features? Every artist brought their A-game, seamlessly blending their energy with Drake's, creating sonic experiences that are out of this world. And let's talk about the culture for a sec. How many memes, TikTok challenges, and Instagram captions has this man inspired? He’s not just making music; he's influencing culture, setting trends, and leaving an indelible mark on the world. Whether it’s the iconic ""Hotline Bling"" dance or the ""Keke, do you love me?"" challenge, Drake’s influence is omnipresent.  


But what truly makes Drake the GOAT isn't just the hits, the awards, or the records. It's the impact. He's touched hearts, ignited passions, and inspired a generation. How many of us have used his lyrics to express ourselves when words failed? How many have found solace in his songs during tough times? Countless.  
Haters? They're just background noise. Every legend faces criticism. But while they're busy nitpicking, Drake's out here making history, breaking records, and leaving a legacy that'll resonate for generations. ""For All The Dogs"" is just another testament to his greatness, another chapter in the legend of Drizzy. We’re witnessing history in the making, and it’s a vibe like no other. I swear, every time I listen to ""For All The Dogs,"" I find a new line or beat that just hits different. And the storytelling? Man, Drake's always been a king of that, but he took it to another level with this album. It's like he's letting us into his soul, sharing his triumphs, his regrets, his love stories, and his heartbreaks. It's raw, it's real, and it's relatable as fuck. But, ya know, haters gonna hate. There's always those folks who wanna discredit Drizzy's greatness. They'll say he's soft or that he doesn't write his own shit. But let's be real, even if he had ghostwriters (which I doubt), the man knows how to pick a beat, deliver a line, and make it resonate with millions. That's a talent in itself. And about him being soft? Man, we're in 2023. It's okay for a dude to be in touch with his feelings and express them. Actually, it's dope. So haters can sit the fuck down with that noise. You don't gotta agree with me, but you can't deny the facts. Numbers don't lie, and neither do platinum records. AND I WILL LYNCH YOU OTHERWISE!! Drake's legacy is cemented, and ""For All The Dogs"" just solidified his title as the GOAT. So, if you haven't given it a listen yet, do yourself a favor and vibe to it. And if you have, then you already know what's up. Drizzy reigns supreme, and I'm just here vibing, appreciating the greatness. Period.

- V album 

- Jungkook album

- Jimin album 

- Sugas album

"Happy new year! New year, new subreddit discography ranking…let’s get it.

# What is the discography ranking?

It is a survey where you can rate every BTS song (some exceptions, see FAQ below) from 1-10. The ratings for each song will be averaged and then ranked from 1 to 345, which is the number of songs in the survey this year. The average ratings will also be used to make album rankings, collaborations rankings, etc. For an idea of what this will look like, here are previous years’ results: [2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/chr8tk/the_results_from_rpopheads_ranking_of_btss_songs/) | [2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/kzbt76/results_rating_btss_discography_20132020/) | [2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/s5mdk2/results_bts_discography_ranking_20132021/)

The survey will be open for four weeks and close on **11:59 pm EST on Saturday, January 28, 2023**. A reminder will be posted 2 weeks before the deadline.

# [SURVEY](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfUWQH9lgq376fdU8a6w6sUYTgYWjJ733xn1LlRGad5WiYyFQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)

# Instructions

* Rate as many songs as you can from 1-10. There is no guideline for how to assign ratings. You can rate based on song artistry, personal preferences, a mix of both—just follow your gut!
* If you come across a song you haven't heard, leave the rating blank until you have listened to the song.
* After you submit your responses, you may add or edit any responses as many times as you would like until the survey closes.
* If you have participated in the survey before, your responses should still be saved if you are using the same email. You may edit any of your previous responses.
   * *Any responses from previous years that are not resubmitted this year will* ***not*** *be considered for this year’s ranking*. This allows the ranking to reflect the opinions of the current year.

# FAQ

* **What is this survey for?** The survey is adapted from r/popheads discography rankings. Ratings for each song will be averaged to create a collective discography ranking. This survey is unaffiliated with any academic or research institution—it is just for fun!
* **Is the survey anonymous?** Yes. You will need to log into your email to access the survey, which serves as a duplication check. However, the survey will not record any email addresses.
* **Who can participate?** Whether you’re a casual fan, baby ARMY, or veteran ARMY, anyone can participate! You do **not** need to have listened to BTS’s entire discography to fill out the survey.
* **Do I have to fill out the entire survey?** No, but the more completed it is, the better. Fill it out to the best of your ability!
* **What songs are included?** Albums, mixtapes and solo releases, original Japanese releases, collaborations, unofficial original/adapted/sampled songs, remixes, and OSTs.
* **What songs are not included?** Skits, Japanese versions of previously released songs, pre-debut songs, covers, songs for brand promotions, alternative mixes, remixes of collaborations, and songs/collaborations/mixes that have only been performed live.
   * Any new songs released while the survey is open will also not be included; they will be added the following year.
* **Can I get a copy of my responses?** Unfortunately, the Google form cannot send you a copy of your responses because it does not record emails.

I skipped over Care Package entirely for a while because I felt I had “heard them all leaked at one point” but once I truly sat down and listened - I realized if it was a finalized and better rolled out album it had enormous potential.

"I swear this has got to be the biggest hidden gem of all time, like so many people, even Ed Sheeran fans don’t even know this album exists, and it’s so. Damn. Good. Like probably one of the greatest debut records of all time and some of his best work ever. The songwriting and emotion on it is just so raw, and it’s some of the most detailed and depressing pop/rap music out there. Songs like Lately, Radio and Goodbye To You are seriously some of his best songs ever. It also has the original, unedited version of The A Team with the rap verses, called Little Lady (yes, the one you know is the “friendly” version), and it’s one of the most horrifying and disturbing songs I’ve ever heard. The whole album is basically Ed collaborating with random underground British rappers, and as someone who is not a fan of rap music, this album is absolutely incredible. Give it a listen, I promise it’s worth it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/EdSheeran/comments/13kd07l/why_does_no_one_ever_talk_about_no5/,Why does no one ever talk about No.5 Collaborations Project?,EdSheeran,t3_13kd07l,/r/EdSheeran/comments/13kd07l/why_does_no_one_ever_talk_about_no5/,2023-05-17 20:24:08,Ed Sheeran,0.3722269

"Some of you like Drake when he’s on his boombap / backpack rapping. Think: Diplomatic Immunity, Omertà, Do not Disturb, time and place series, etc. 

Some of you like Drake for his trap high energy bangers. Think: IYARTITL, Her Loss, WATTBA, None stop, Started from the bottom, etc. 

Some of you like Drake for his melodic/ R&B songs. Think: Jungle, Passionfruit, Hold On We’re Going Home, Race My Mind, etc. 

There’s a lot more: Caribbean vibes, uk rap, heart break Drake, etc. 

I appreciate all of his styles but my personal favorite has to be nocturnal Drake. Those songs that you could get lost in at 2AM in the morning for hours on loop. Let me show you what I mean.  

Here’s an example of a nocturnal song of some projects: 
Nothing Was The Same - Connect 
What A Time To Be Alive - Plastic Bag 
Views - Fire & Desire 
Scorpion - Jaded 
Dark Lane Demo Tapes - Not You Too 
Her Loss - I Guess It’s Fuck Me

None of his projects emphasize this nocturnal style as priority number 1 expect Honestly Nevermind. It still has some outliers because it’s Drake and the dude is diverse so we get some bangers (Sticky, Jimmy Crooks) but everything else is either house (fits the nocturnal sound well with its song structure and sonic in general) or Nocturnal. We also get Drake’s most nocturnal song imo with Liability (shout out to the slow and reverb community) 

I don’t think there is a better Drake project for when 
you’re lonely, it’s night, and you’re aimlessly driving just to feel something than Honestly Nevermind. 

Nothing Was the Same, Views, and Scorpion Side B are honorable mentions.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Drizzy/comments/178fmom/honestly_nevermind_is_drakes_most_nocturnally/,Honestly Nevermind is Drake’s most nocturnally cohesive album and deserves more recognition for it,Drizzy,t3_178fmom,/r/Drizzy/comments/178fmom/honestly_nevermind_is_drakes_most_nocturnally/,2023-10-15 13:42:35,Drake,0.23343207

"ik drake loves his mom and they tight and he’s sandra’s rose and shit but… does he always gotta be insulting this chick at every chance?

his latest instagram post made me realize how serious this been. @champagnepapi : “I take pride in seeing my mama live her life after all those years of tears in her eyes trying to survive…” does sandra deserve this kind of exposure?

it just feels like insults to me. he makes it seem like his mom is this grumpy smoking old woman with back problems. I don’t know the chick but I don’t think she deserves these lyrics:

“mama used to be on disability”

“I was payin mamas rent when I was turning 17”

“your back hurt and your neck hurt and you smoking heavy. and I sit next to you and lecture you cuz those are deadly”

“I was on TV making 50 racks a year. after helping mama out that shit would disappear”

“my mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone”

“I see painkillers on the kitchen counter…but maybe I wouldn’t have worked so hard if you were healthy and it weren’t so bad”

"# Voting phase

Right now, you will be voting on your favorite submissions to the bi-weekly mashup contest, powered by [r/mashups](https://www.reddit.com/r/mashups/). The theme is:  **Grand Theft Auto V Non-Stop Pop Album.**

The criteria for this contest was creating **a mashup where at least one prominent source is a** [**song played on the in-game Grand Theft Auto V Non-Stop Pop radio station**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DGaJN7WbxcPx1Cwbxp1rChcSq91PDy4h5tVaw5JnzJg/edit?usp=sharing) **(see linked workbook for a list). Bonus points for songs that are modal (Dorian, Phrygian, Mixolydian, Melodic Minor, etc. as marked on the workbook in bold). Songs that are underused, and do not have volunteers or submissions for the album, are preferred (# of Volunteers should be blank for the given song in the workbook).**

The mashups that you will vote on are located in this thread. They have been anonymized and randomized so that you vote on the mashups submitted, not the artists making it.

Note: All lossless entries above 16-bit 48 kHz encoding have been converted to lossless at 16-bit with max 48 kHz sampling rate to conserve space for download.

**You can also download all files here:** [**https://we.tl/t-MVlMOEWRjA**](https://we.tl/t-MVlMOEWRjA). Fully tagged tracks will be added after the contest unless requested not to.

Please keep the following in mind:

* **To vote for a mashup to win this contest, you must** ***comment the word ""Voted"" on the given thread for a submission.***
* **You may vote for any number of entries; please don't vote for all of them.**
* **Do NOT vote for yourself; it will not count.**
* **An upvote will not count as a vote.**
* **You will have until Saturday, May 27, 2023 at 12 noon EDT/5 PM BST to vote for the entries.**
* **Voting in this phase counts as 50% weight, with the other 50% coming from judging for creativity and technical merit.**

Once the votes are in, I will go ahead and listen closely to the entries to help determine a winner. Note that I'll ultimately judge on quality starting from the minimum criteria.

EDIT: A little more than 12 hours to vote. The organizers have informed me that the album is still on, and will be better managed going forward. Contest will continue and rules still apply.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mashups/comments/13ql8di/contest_rmashups_biweekly_contest_grand_theft/,"[Contest] /r/mashups Bi-Weekly Contest, Grand Theft Auto V Non-Stop Pop Album.

"hi everyone!! I know some people have been asking about how queuing is going to work for Wembley (mainly camping) so I though it would be better if I emailed them. 

They said that camping is prohibited and in terms of honouring lines like last year, they ""can confirm \[their\] security will be there to move along any campers"". lines for pits and pods start at 6am so make sure you get there on the dot so you don't get moved or kicked out. in terms of seated tickets they recommend you get there the latest possible so there's not a lot of people gathered outside waiting to be let in. 

In the words of my guy Dan ""the rules are in place and the security will be there to enforce the rules"". 

Again this is all communicated directly from the Wembley staff :)

my thoughts are if you still decide to camp don't expect your fan made line to be honoured by the venue or other fans since it isn't an official line and you weren't following the rules so you're obviously not going to get compensated for that. Some venues have started to take action for campers like taking them to the back of the line so I recommend you just don't risk it get there at 6am so you don't ruin your experience!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/harrystyles/comments/13xkfj0/hslot_wembley_queuing_information/,HSLOT Wembley queuing information!!!,harrystyles,t3_13xkfj0,/r/harrystyles/comments/13xkfj0/hslot_wembley_queuing_information/,2023-06-01 15:24:26,Harry Styles,0.044883765

"During this album (and I absolutely could be *completely* wrong) I felt like I noticed a couple things

It felt like the moving song was about an affair to me, perhaps one Ed had with another girl. I also noticed that there were lines in the album (I can’t quite remember) but you say things like white daggers. 

It seems he’s struggling a lot. I’m jus y curious if anyone else thought this. Like in moving he says, “and I never want to hear your name again” so “start moving on”. “Let’s forget it even happened “babe””

Listening to the whole album I got the impression he’s not just struggling, but that he’s having relationships problems as well. Anyone else notice this? And did no one feel that him continually referencing the embrace of th salt water, coupled by the fact that the beginning of every music video was his car crashed in water felt a little suspect?

"Hello fellow Army 😃

I am pretty sure this may have already been asked so I apologise in advance. I have looked I thought i saw a post someone else made but I cant find it. 

I was hoping for some guidance on where to start the journey of the journey that is BTS.

I know they have several programs on Bangtantv. Any suggestions on which one to start with first? 

Any advice will be greatly appreciated as I feel a little overwhelmed with all of the things out there.

"Hi all!

I purchased two sets of tickets for one of the intimate venue Subtract shows through Stubhub on May 2 (the day they were released). I received a confirmation email stating that my tickets would be transferred to my Axs account by July 19 - I understand we are still way out from that, but wanted to check in and see if anyone else has gone through this process and already received their transfers. 

In all honesty, I have just heard horror stories about certain artists/venues not allowing for tickets to be transferred this way, and am worried I will find out a day before the show that this applies to mine.

"I don't care if you deny it and I don't care to argue about it, but to my ears it's quite obvious they always lipsync whenever they do those covers. I've listened to enough kpop to know my share of live and non-live performances and semi-live performances. Recent example that 3D cover. Like, I get it sometimes idols STILL sing live with *some* backtrack because of heavy choreography but this was full on lipsync as well as many of their other covers. Like what's the point of doing that ''special'' cover at all for a live show then, just release the audio cover on soundcloud or something. And it's not a few times with them, it's all the times. Even the few covers their fans defend/claim were actually live... like I know what I'm hearing, let's stop here.

Another thing that I hate that they do with many of those covers is you can always tell/hear that bighit tends to not so subtly try to alter their vocal colors to sound more same-y to the original, because TXT's vocal colors sound nothing like that in their own songs. And they do it of course mainly by using autotune and other tools but in the past and during their earlier days I've noticed they almost seem to kinda mesh some actual bits and adlibs of the original recording into the Cover in order to give it that ''sounds like the original'' kind of vibes. Which ruins the whole point of it being a Cover... to me personally. It's just a set up in my eyes. Like just sing the damn song in your own voice/style.

I realize this is kinda controversial, might get me hate and all that, but it's something I've thought for a long time and well, it's just my personal opinion, nothing against the idols themselves nor do I hate them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop_uncensored/comments/18qvrpx/kinda_tired_of_bighit_making_txt_lipsync_whenever/,Kinda tired of bighit making TXT lipsync whenever they do BTS covers,kpop_uncensored,t3_18qvrpx,/r/kpop_uncensored/comments/18qvrpx/kinda_tired_of_bighit_making_txt_lipsync_whenever/,2023-12-26 01:01:23,BTS,0.3367073

"BTS & ATEEZ are my ultimate favorite groups and I would like to create a playlist of their songs that have similar vibe/leave a similar feeling.

It doesn't necessarily have to be similar in terms of music style (they tend to differ), it could even be a pair of slow ballad and fast paced song- it's mostly about the feeling that those songs leave in you, or lyrical similarity, anything- it could be subjective.

"*(Here's an essay I wrote about Nick Drake's life that tries to combine my love of science and music)*

The middle of the 20th century saw a surge in the technological and theoretical developments of radio astronomy. Radio telescope sites were now being measured in *acres* with their antennae able to detect even the faintest of signals. With this newfound capacity to prod the universe for messages from terrestrial systems lightyears away, the natural question of life elsewhere was on every starry-eyed scientist’s mind. In a symphony of waves and frequencies, radio telescopes transformed into cosmic ears, listening for the whispers of distant stars and galaxies, while also sparking the profound question: are we alone in the cosmos?

Among the crucial architects of the reinvigorated field of radio astronomy was *Frank Drake*, a professor at Cornell who sought to rigorously define a probabilistic argument in the form of an equation for estimating the number of active and communicative civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy.

$$N=R_* \cdot f_P \cdot n_e \cdot f_l \cdot f_i \cdot f_c \cdot L$$

This equation is not meant to provide a definitive answer to the question of how many advanced civilizations might exist in the galaxy, but rather to structure the factors that play a role in the formation and detectability of such civilizations. The result is *N*, the average (or expected) number of signal transmitting societies in the Galaxy now. Clearly, if this number is very small, then the chances of detecting a signal are congruently small.

---

The middle of the 20th century also saw the birth of *Nick* Drake. Though born in Burma in 1948, he was raised in the idyllic rolling countryside of England. A prototypical wallflower, Drake was well-liked yet entirely inaccessible to his community — the sight of his own shoes was often infinitely more enthralling than eye contact with a peer.

Yet, maybe as a product of this social anxiety, Drake quickly honed his ethereal guitar chops and began writing about his world. While at university, he had a knack for showing up to parties, singing truly haunted poetry overtop a mesmerizing guitar melody, and subsequently melding into the wallpaper with his drug of choice for the night.

> ""Nick was in some strange way out of time. When you were with him, you always had a sad feeling of him being born in the wrong century. If he would have lived in the 17th Century, at the Elizabethan Court, together with composers like Dowland or William Byrd, he would have been alright. Nick was elegant, honest, a lost romantic - and at the same time so cool.” — Robert Kirby
> 

In the late 1960s, Nick was detected by a small record company and given the space to record his first album, *Five Leaves Left*. Reservation time was consistently wasted on Nick changing the tuning of his guitar for each song and his many other perfectionist tendencies. Leveraging the top-of-the-line studio equipment, he spent hours layering tracks with multiple instruments which needed to be recorded dozens of times in varying ways to get exactly the sound Nick could hear deep in his mind. Unsurprisingly, the atmosphere of these studio sessions was often tense, as Nick tirelessly worked to translate his musical vision into a recording.

Despite this, the album was eventually released, marking Nick’s arrival on Earth, and his singular gift was unveiled — an ability to conjure melodies that resonated with the heartbeats of the universe.

---

In 1974, astronomers transmitted a potent message from the Arecibo Radio in Puerto Rico as part of a ceremony celebrating the latest technological upgrades. The message consisted of 1679 bits, meticulously arranged into 73 lines, each containing 23 characters (both prime numbers, chosen to potentially assist extraterrestrial beings in deciphering the message). This arrangement formed a rudimentary image. The entire transmission lasted for less than three minutes and depicted, among various elements, the Arecibo telescope, our solar system, DNA helix, a basic human stick figure, and certain biochemical components of terrestrial life.

This transmission was precisely directed toward the globular star cluster M13, a plausible cosmic sibling to our own star cluster, carrying with it the aspiration that if the message were to be received and reciprocated, it would imply the existence of life akin to ours elsewhere in the universe. Humanities mighty yawp was cast out into the cosmic void with only the faintest hope that it might resonate with some distant intelligence — but we had to try.

---

The release of Drake’s first album fell flat – selling somewhere between 1,000 and 1,500 copies. For a budding record company, a number not even worth keeping tabs on. Nevertheless, the young artist persisted and released his sophomore album *Bryter Layter* which was ultimately met with a similar critical reception by the English masses. Overwhelmed by depression and lacking in confidence, Nick walked out of his final public gig halfway through performing *“Fruit Tree”* when he finally looked up from the ground to see that the audience had all gone. The deeply introspective pieces he so painstakingly crafted were too alien for an audience to appreciate.

Nick responded by retreating even further inward, disconnecting from his life by sneaking away to Spain. While abroad, he became suddenly overtaken with an intense urgency to express himself one more time. Within *two* nights, Drake had recorded his 28-minute masterpiece – *Pink Moon.* The 23-year-old decided to do away with other musicians or instruments altogether – just one soul and an acoustic guitar. The album has an unsettling simplicity, as Nick wanted his music to “stand naked” for humanity to judge.

Though dark and almost painfully honest, the album offers a direct window into Nick’s mind. Brimming with creative brilliance and unceasing melancholy, he quickly traverses through 11 songs, yearning solely to be understood. His search of even a faint connection with another soul is heartbreaking. In the bleak masterpiece *Parasite*, Drake likens his journey on the London Underground to the emptiness of contemporary life.

*Pink Moon* eventually discovered its audience, garnered the well-deserved critical acclaim, and achieved platinum status — *posthumously*.

---

Despite the high probability of extra-terrestrial life existing *somewhere* within the vast cosmos, the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI) project has yielded a staggering lack of evidence of communication from any advanced civilizations. We call this contradiction *Fermi’s Paradox –* a scientific name for humanities nagging question: *""where is everybody?""*

This inability to discern any indications of extraterrestrial life gives rise to intriguing questions about the factors that might be preventing such contact or perceptibility. Maybe they don’t want to contact us, or conversely, maybe they do, and we simply can’t see it. We can’t help but what wonder if our relentless pursuit to recognize life beyond Earth inadvertently hinders our ability to perceive the outcast beings that may already coexist with us.

---

Across the seven years of Nick’s recording career, his sales and popularity were sparse at best. The zeitgeist of the 70s was not yet ready for introspective, nakedly elegiac songs — or the man who created them. A rapturous signal being broadcast *from* Earth, a bleak and desperate plea for help, was entirely ignored by humanity. In *Things Behind the Sun***,** Drake sings

> *Please beware of them that stare*
> 
> 
> *They’ll only smile to see you while*
> 
> *Your time away*
> 
> *And once you’ve seen what they have been*
> 
> *To win the earth just won’t seem worth*
> 
> *Your night or your day*
> 

In fixating on potential profound messages emanating from the cosmos, we inadvertently overlook the fact that marvelous beings exist here on Earth. Astronomy is a humbling and character-building effort that serves no better purpose than to underscore our responsibility to deal more kindly with and cherish one another on the only home we will likely ever know.

In one of Nick’s last conversations with his mother, while hopelessly anchored at home due to an inability to face the world that so shunned him, he said:

> “***If only I could feel my music had done anything to help one **single** person. It would have made it worth it.”*
> 

Nick Drake took his own life on November 25th, 1974 at the age of just 26. Reflecting on such a momentary blip in the grand cosmic calendar, I only wish I could describe to him how spectacularly he succeeded with at least one soon to be 26 year old.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/167dlav/the_drake_equation_nick_drake_essay/,The Drake Equation -- Nick Drake Essay,Music,t3_167dlav,/r/Music/comments/167dlav/the_drake_equation_nick_drake_essay/,2023-09-01 17:35:07,Drake,0.038519915

"When his homie discovers this peculiar quirk of his, he figures this is the key to finally defeating the undisputed heavyweight champion, Bruce “Bloody Knuckles” Rankinov.  So, with the help of his other mischievous homies, they formulate a plan to sneak Drake into the ring under the name “Aubrey “Fancy Pants” Graham.  On the night of the boxing match, they bring Drake (wearing a blindfold) along to the arena.  “Gee, fellas, it was awfully kind of you to take me the boxing match.  I can’t wait to see who Bloody Knuckles pummels this time!”  “Take off your blindfold… NOW!”  Drake takes off his blindfold and sees Bloody Knuckles towering over him, like an edifice of death.  “Oh, boy! You got me V. I. P. tickets for a meet and greet with Bloody Knuckles?! This is the best night of my life!” “Well… not quite.” The announcer then says into his microphone “In this corner, at 7’7”, 450 pounds of unbridled rage, the undisputed heavyweight champion of the century… BRUCE “BLOODY KNUCKLES” RANKINOV!” “What’s going o-“ “And in this corner, at 5’4”, 100 pounds of embarrassment… AUBREY GRAHAM!” “Wait… fellas… I-“ His homie then commences playing Drake’s trigger song on his accordion that appeared out of nowhere.  In a flash, Drake absolutely beats the breaks out of his opponent.  The arena just watches absolutely gobsmacked.  Before you know it, it’s all over.  “And the winner is Aubrey Graham!”  Drake takes one look at his battered foe and says “did I do that?” A laugh track plays and an iris closes in.

He stands up, slams his knight down in he middle of the board as it shakes. The table rumbles and his opponent looks around flabbergasted.

"I'm so insecure it's annoying, months ago I wanted to be 90lbs (I'm 5'8, and 155lb months ago, I've probably list weight since then), I only eat one meal everyday, all week I've been pulling all nighters and sleeping all day, my stomach shrank to where I eat a small meal and feel so full I'm about to throw up, I can't tell my mom because then I'll be put on probation watch, if I tell my friends I'll be told it's for attention, I haven't started blacking out yet, (I used to black out) I'm seriously scared though. I already know I cant tell anyone because when I told my mom I was cutting myself on my thighs and arms she told everyone, I started again a while ago, I'm constantly bullied and called a man because I'm a transgender mtf woman, so often I've almost killed myself before, I've been raising my mom's kids my whole life, I haven't really had a childhood, I sneak out almost every night all week to go spend time with my best friend I have so much love and appreciation, I don't trust men because of the plethora of exes I have, I smoke weed and I'm kind of pressured into it by my mom, whenever I tell her I don't want to she's asking why and she wants me to smoke 24/7 with her whenever I'm there, I'm only 13,she started smoking at that age and I smoked with her at 11 because of the household we were in,I like smoking weed and being high but I don't want it taking over my life, I sometimes feel like I'm not really doing what I'm doing like my body is moving and I'm just inside of it, I wouldn't call it out if body, but like I'm trapped in my own body, I just hate being me I'm not even that pretty I'm the type of pretty you could take or leave, I'm being screened for bipolar disorder, which kinda makes sense instead of it being brushed off as teens being teens, I think I'm 3 weeks clean cutting wise and I found somewhere nobody checks when I cut myself, school starts soon and I'm not ready to be shut on by everybody this year it's annoying, I just have so much on my plate, I just want to be gone so bad, I don't want to die but I want to just disappear, I stay in my room and just exist here while I'm awake, I barely get out the worst part is I'm at my favourite grand parents house and she's having a party for her work friends tomorrow and I'm not gonna have anywhere besides my room that doesn't have people. Theyll probably be here when I wake up too, I mean there'll be alcohol out that I can probably nab but still, I'm just unready, I just needed to vent, I hope you guys are having a better day than my past few years have been, yours truly, seaworthyness",https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/15ig6yh/i_seriously_dont_know_what_to_do_tw_sh_ed_ect/,"I seriously don't know what to do (tw: sh, ED, ect.)",teenagers,t5_2rjli,/r/teenagers/comments/15ig6yh/i_seriously_dont_know_what_to_do_tw_sh_ed_ect/,2023-08-04 23:58:03,Ed Sheeran,0.25462922

"Happy Wednesday, r/bts7! 💜 This week, we’re trialling something new - Would You Rather Wednesday. 

**It’s simple: leave your WYDs down below in the comments and then let others leave their reasons of what they’d rather.** 

The classic example is, would you rather 5 x Jungkook or a 5-year old Jungkook? But your WYD can be song-related, content-related or absolutely whack. For example:

* Would you rather be in an episode of Bon Voyage or In The Soop?
* Would you rather have BTS *finally* perform Paradise or Louder Than Bombs?
* Would you rather go for a bicycle ride on a super hot and humid day with Namjoon or have a 3 hour gym session with Jungkook where he goes all out?
* Would you rather metal concept Bangtan or country concept Bangtan?

"The question I have, because we keep seeing kpop [journalists](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-67678907) talk about it, is how has BTS being shelved (for their service in this case) gonna make room for other idols in the ""spotlight""? Are they not thriving and succeeding as they are? Winning daesangs, bbmas, topping charts and being multi million sellers? 

""Meanwhile for the rest of the thriving K-pop industry, BTS' absence offers opportunities for the other bands breaking through. Several have already made it onto Western mainstream charts - listeners having cottoned on to bands like New Jeans, Le SSerafim.

""BTS was too focused on by media outlets,"" says Associate Prof Parc. ""This pause will give other K-pop groups changes to receive more of the limelight. It's a win-win situation for the industry.""""

So why does BTS have to go away for others to succeed like have? I just feel like this is highkey the ""next BTS"" conversation reworded. And it's not like BTS got that attention off of the backs of others, but it's their own success that put them there being the biggest reason for Kpop's expansion into the west. Idk how to articulate it but it really irks me the way the media talk about BTS in this way.

I know what most of you are thinking, I'm going to be called: ""crazy, millennial, no taste..."". The truth is after listening to many genres and liking most styles of rap I'm going to mention my reasons as to why Drake is the best ever, and also why I think it's not consensus.  


1. **Greatest Hook Rapper of all time** (In the 2010's most hooks he was on became instant hits)
2. **Most Versatile rapper of all time** (Can get into any rap style from Trap, Boom Bap, Pop, AfroBeats etc)
3. **Greatest Feature rapper of all time** (Most of his features in the 2010s created careers, a Drake feature was a guaranteed hit and career boost)
4. **Greatest Single's Rapper of all time** (The number of hits and singles he's created in the 2020's alone is bigger than a lot of rappers careers)
5. **Longevity as a Top rapper** (No rapper has been on top as a top 3 rapper this long)
6. **Greatest Hip-Hop/Pop rapper of all time** (No rapper was this successful at making Pop music like Drake)
7. **Introduced many rappers and genres to mainstream music**: Afrobeats, UK rap, Future, Migos, Weeknd...
8. His **early mixtapes** in the **2000's** (Room For Improvement) with production from 8th wonder and other boom Bap producers are underrated and show that if he wanted to be a one dimensional rapper he'd still be better than most
9. **Greatest male Rapper/R&B artist ever**
10. Second Greatest Rapper/R&B artist ever after Lauryn Hill
11. **Responsible for Hip-Hop being number 1 genre in the 2010's** with features and streams pushing the genre to a level it never reached before.

Why I think Drake is hated:

1. He isn't American ( He doesn't have any city or hood repping him like LA, NYC, ATL so he's isolated)
2. He became too big
3. His demographic went beyond rap fans: kids, high school girls, grandparents all started listening to Drake
4. The fact that he also makes other genres like Pop
5. Fake allegations of Ghost writing
6. His background isn't that of hood American rappers who struggled
7. He talks about relationships (so did LL Cool J)

To conclude I do think that as time passes the sound of hip hop will become more and more the Drake sound and in 5-10 years it will be almost obvious to put him in the top 3...Also just like 2Pac many rappers in the present are hated for reasons that don't make any sense. Just like 2Pac once he died he was seen almost unanimously as one if not the greatest of all time. And I think Drake is on a similar route",https://www.reddit.com/r/Drizzy/comments/16twxu3/why_drake_is_the_greatest_rapper_of_all_time/,Why Drake is the Greatest Rapper of all time! 🦉,Drizzy,t3_16twxu3,/r/Drizzy/comments/16twxu3/why_drake_is_the_greatest_rapper_of_all_time/,2023-09-27 21:39:24,Drake,0.32397532

"No me gusto el nuevo álbum de bad bunny, nadie sabe lo que pasará mañana.

Esta es mi opinión personal así que si te gusto el álbum esta bien.

No me gusto por qué se me hizo muy básico y repetitivo.
La única canción buena para mi es seda,  me gusto el flow.
Yo quería un álbum de trap pero de antes, con almighty, anuel aa, ozuna, maluma y brytiago.
Ellos fueron los que iniciaron con el trap latino.
En la época dorada del trap (2015 - 2018) 
También me hubiera encantado una producción de mambo kingz y  dj luian.

El álbum no es malo, solamente que no cumplió con mis expectativas.

"Hi everyone! I went to the KC show, and i wanted to give y’all a little tip. for starters, you definitely wanna get there early and get your merch beforehand. They have a merch truck outside of the stadium and it’ll be worth it, we got there at 3 (gates to the stadium opened at 4:30) there was a line, but we were only in line for maybe 20 minutes. 


IF YOU’RE ON THE FLOOR there’s not gonna be a space for you to set your merch down, and a lot of stadiums don’t allow bags so they won’t give you a bag. Soooo get a drawstring bag from Amazon, hide it underneath your clothes, and once you make it past security, pull it out and put your merch in there!! I stuck them in my bra, you couldn’t tell i had them and they fit everything i bought! (a hoodie and 2 tees) If anyone wants the link to the bags I bought just let me know!

"I can say in most of drake's songs, he is not talking about women in a positive light. It is always about women who ruin Bahamas trips or leave him jaded.

I'm not knocking that - he is truthful in his music and these themes are super relatable. It is comforting for me to hear this kinda stuff and know that other men go through this as well.

I do wonder the impact though, because it does fuel a mindset of lack of trust with women and general anger towards them. It's not music that makes me ""man up"" and consider what I did wrong. Instead it empowers me that its them, not me.

"A lot of people would argue that YouTube views numbers or Spotify streams can't be taken seriously to assert a K-pop group's popularity, and I tend to agree most of the time. But particularly, I think it means something that we are more than halfway through this year and only these 5 groups have reached these numbers on these platforms. 

BTS and BLACKPINK are definitely the two biggest groups in K-pop right now, and their numbers come as no surprise to anyone. What calls my attention the most are the numbers of the other three groups in question. 

TWICE has always been a huge name in the K-pop scene but it was never JYPE's intention to promote the group in the west. Its focus has always been the Asian markets. And even so, they conquered a huge audience in practically the whole world. 

Stray Kıds are quite the opposite, having started their career as a group that didn't get much attention in Korea. But things definitely changed from 2020 with God' Menu, which was when they really exploded in the West and established their fan base mainly in countries in that region, only to later conquer Asian markets, such as China and Japan. 

I don't know to what extent this is an accepted opinion among K-pop fans, but I truly believe that right now, after BTS and BLACKPINK, Stray Kids and TWICE are the most popular groups around the world right now. Having a considerable difference between them and the groups that are below. 

 NewJeans is an even more curious case. The group definitely drew attention since their debut, but I doubt anyone expected that in such a short time they would reach such high numbers, not only in Asia, but also in the West, especially in the US. 

But the question remains: will HYBE be able to capitalize on the success of NewJeans in the west. After all, we must remember that there is a difference between people knowing the group and people actually willing to spend money with the group. 

I believe that currently, BTS, BLACKPINK, Stray Kids and TWICE are the only K-pop groups able to perform as big in the West as they do in Asian countries. Would NewJeans eventually be able to do the same? 

Now, I want to ask you, what do you think about these 5 groups being the only ones to reach these numbers this year? Do you believe that really means anything about how popular they are? And what do you expect from these groups for the future? Do you think they can still grow even more or have they reached their peak?",https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/14wad5f/bts_blackpink_twice_newjeans_and_straykids_twice/,"BTS, BLACKPINK, TWICE, NewJeans and StrayKids TWICE are the only Korean groups to surpass 1B streams on either or both Spotify and Youtube this 2023.",kpopthoughts,t3_14wad5f,/r/kpopthoughts/comments/14wad5f/bts_blackpink_twice_newjeans_and_straykids_twice/,2023-07-10 23:41:11,BTS,0.05824285

"Hi guys,

Did anyone buy BTS world original soundtrack on iTunes? I don’t know if it’s a EU/UK thing.

But I bought the soundtrack on iTunes in 2019 when it came out because I really loved it. 

But a few weeks/ month ago when I tried to play any song on it, it would come up with a message saying:
Purchase of this item is not currently available, this item is being modified.

But today I searched it on iTunes and it’s there but it’s asking me to purchase it again. (It’s like I never bought the soundtrack, when I did, I even found the receipts and it’s on my purchase history.) which also means it’s not really being modified.

" I was at a friend's lake house with 5 other people from my school that had been invited about a week ago. We stayed for a week and went tubing, rode jet skis, wake boarded and hung out at the house and played  yard games. All of us are having a blast, until the 5th night when one of the girls there who I only know because I had just met her asks me to meet her in the room we were staying in. I was questioning if I should because I had just met her, but I had spent a lot of time with her over the past couple of days. She seemed to have a lot of interest in me because every meal there she had sat next to me by choice. She also always asked to go tubing with me and always laughed when I made a joke. I decided why not, since she was a very nice person, attractive, and I had developed a crush on her. Back to the story, later that night, I headed to her room around 11 PM and knocked, and walked in. She told me to get in bed and asked for my consent. We started to make out and as it went on it slowly became more intimate and intense. After it was all said and done, we got all cleaned up and slept together for the night. I loved the whole experience. She said how good I was, even though it was my first time. Now that I'm thinking about it, I probably should've used a condom. The girl turns out to live in the same neighborhood as me and has asked me to hook up again. I've kept it a secret and none of the other people from the vacation have found out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/15duszy/i_lost_my_vcard_with_a_girl_i_dont_know_very_well/,I lost my v-card with a girl I don't know very well.,teenagers,t5_2rjli,/r/teenagers/comments/15duszy/i_lost_my_vcard_with_a_girl_i_dont_know_very_well/,2023-07-30 20:00:08,BTS,0.15324512

"Happy Wednesday, r/bts7! 💜 This week, we’re trialling something new - Would You Rather Wednesday. 

**It’s simple: leave your WYDs down below in the comments and then let others leave their reasons of what they’d rather.** 

The classic example is, would you rather 5 x Jungkook or a 5-year old Jungkook? But your WYD can be song-related, content-related or absolutely whack. For example:

* Would you rather be in an episode of Bon Voyage or In The Soop?
* Would you rather have BTS *finally* perform Paradise or Louder Than Bombs?
* Would you rather go for a bicycle ride on a super hot and humid day with Namjoon or have a 3 hour gym session with Jungkook where he goes all out?
* Would you rather metal concept Bangtan or country concept Bangtan?
* Would you rather have a sneak peak into the Genius Lab and listen to unreleased songs or have a sneak peak at Hopefilm and see pictures from over the years?

The more silly, lighthearted and absolutely abstract, the better. Plenty of links to evidence is highly encouraged!

[6 charged with conspiracy to acquire PPE, TP, tickets to OSU sporting events | Southwest Ledger](https://www.southwestledger.news/news/6-charged-conspiracy-acquire-ppe-tp-tickets-osu-sporting-events) 

Oh but how do I know Drake is linked to her? [Here you go.](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/2a/d1/f0/2ad1f0d176674091d99c5d067ff85696.jpg) 

Is she still around Drake? Well as of 12 weeks ago, [here you go.](https://www.threads.net/@babymirnz/post/CuxEj09N75m)

But if this was true, wouldn't she be named dropped in song? Here you go.

Hours In Silence is written about her, with lines such as... 

""Baby M, you know I got a heart of gold  
You pawned that shit and hit the road"" 

""It's my fault for once, I got the Wagon, G  
Got you ridin' 'round with niggas that are nothin' like me.""

He bought her a G-Wagon. [Proof](https://www.instagram.com/p/CH-P8sogdM8/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=9f553a43-de3a-4db2-951d-2bd42110aab2) [More Proof](https://www.instagram.com/p/CH-P5mEATn4/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=bcb43af0-606d-4027-9979-edcf9e83b629)

""My fault for once, I'm payin' lawyer fees"" Drake paid her $683,243.23 in restitution along with her lawyer fees.

You need more proof that Drake was dating the scammer of the century after you just listened to Hours In Silence? 

Here you go. In the on the Radar freestyle Drake talks about her stealing from him when he says...

""Pass me a glass of the vino.  
If a girl try take my Rolex to buy some Valentino  
I tell Baby M what she did to the kid, then I line her like emo""

He also got her a billboard in Times Square, paid her rent, surgerical fees, the list goes on of everything he's done for her.

She also does the typical leaking stories about herself to blogs. [Here](https://radaronline.com/p/drake-splits-fling-johanna-leia-dodgers-date-new-girlfriend-canadian-certified-lover-boy/)

I get she has ""super powers on her knee's"" but that seems like a plethora or emotions to endure from just one woman. 

She is also the woman in the voicemail on calling for you that, ~~ruined the song~~, presumably was recorded by one of her friends and sent to Drake in which engineers put heavy autotune over. Maybe that was him sayin the gig is up and he truly understands now who she truly is.

"Drake is distracted by TikTok videos until he catches a glimpse of the advanced program.  For their latest project, the students are building incredibly intricate drones and hovercrafts.  Drake is utterly astonished.  “Wowee! It’s like an episode of the Jetsons!” As soon as he says this, a robot maid serves everyone chocolate milk.  Then, a Time Machine appears in the classroom and a student dressed as Henry VIII steps out.  “It works!”

Later that day, Drake is doing his math test and realizes that the math questions he has to answer are much simpler compared to the complex equations on the whiteboard in the advanced program.  However, he has a much more difficult time learning them compared to the gifted students, who are all rocket scientists.  Drake wonders if he’s stupid.  “I must be a complete failure.  I didn’t even learn how to tie my shoes until I was in fifth grade and these kids were already winning Nobel Prizes in physics!”  He decides enough is enough and makes it his ultimate mission to learn every bit accumulated knowledge on planet Earth.

After school, he heads to the library and checks out every book they have to offer.  He soon realizes they all look boring to him but nevertheless begins to study.  At least, that’s what he thinks he’s doing.  In reality, he just briefly skims over all the books and only retains the most surface level information.  The kind everyone already knows.  “I think I’m ready to join that program!”

The next day, he waltzes in and clears his throat to direct everyone’s attention to him.  “I demand you let me become a member of the advanced program!” “You do realize it’s not up to us whether or not you get placed in this class, right?” “Of course I did! I know everything!” “Well, if you really wanna stick around, you can help us built our drone.” “With pleasure” As predicted, he’s comically inept compared to the rocket scientists who actually know what they’re doing.  “You do know how to build a drone, right?” “Does a bat lay eggs?” he says sarcastically, actually believing bats lay eggs. “…no… bats are mammals.” “Huh, I didn’t know that.” “I thought you said you knew everything.” “Huh… I do!” “Then… how did you not know that?” The jig is up.

"Idk if this has been discussed before (I’m a pretty new belieber— within the last two years) but has anyone else realized that Justin’s nose has changed significantly from the beginning of his career to where it is now?

Edit: I know people’s noses grow over time. And that people don’t get nose jobs to make their noses bigger. But to me it seems like more pointy that doesnt seem like naturally.

"This is a screenshot of one of the snippets of Overdrive, which he posted. In the video he said he could've held a diary for AUSTIN, so this is a sneakpeak of when they're producing AUSTIN.

Renamed songs:
You can see Something Real, and Too Cool To Die are missing, with some others songs. I think Posty first named Something Real 'Double Edged Sword', because in Something Real he talks abt a double edged sword cutting of ties with the ones he knows. Too Cool To Die was first named 'Dynamite', because in Too Cool To Die he talks abt him being Dynamite.

Unreleased / scrapped song:
You can also see some songs that you've never heard before, even the name. 'Tapeworm', 'Go Team' and 'Nazareth Junior Allsons' (this one is a bit vague).

Joy also first was supposed to go into the main tracklist of AUSTIN, but didn't make the final cut.

"**Note: An updated post has been made revising this date to June 14th due to technical issues and Festa. **

———

Dear r/bts7,

On April 18, Reddit announced a new pricing plan for its API access that will virtually render their third party apps, like Apollo and Sync, useless. This means that we will either need to use the official Reddit app or desktop version to consume all things Bangtan.

This won't be an issue for casual users, but there's a lot of us who use third party functions in order to make this site more manageable and accessible.

As a response to this, and after internal mod discussion, r/bts7 is joining the [growing list](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1) of subs going dark. **During this dark period, the subreddit will go private for June 12 for 24 hours. Users that joined our subreddit prior to June 12 will still be able to use, post and comment on the sub as per normal.**

We acknowledge your modmail and comments voicing issues and concerns surrounding this topic, and thank you for your patience and understanding.

If you'd like to protest while using Reddit, we would recommend not using the official app and using an ad block extension on desktop.

We hope you all can continue to enjoy Festa in its entirety - now everyone go watch Suchwita ft. 2seok again.

Love,
The mods at r/bts7 💜",https://www.reddit.com/r/bts7/comments/146xwwh/rbts7_is_going_dark_on_june_12_to_protest_reddits/,r/bts7 is going dark on June 12 to protest Reddit's changes to API access,bts7,t3_146xwwh,/r/bts7/comments/146xwwh/rbts7_is_going_dark_on_june_12_to_protest_reddits/,2023-06-11 16:14:17,BTS,0.06104896

"It’s Jungkook’s [Birthday today](https://x.com/charts_k/status/1697277307260424244?s=46) and I am here scrolling on social media, watching army celebrate his birthday. Both new and old fans and it got me thinking, how many people have watched him grow up. He was introduced at 15. He has just turned 26. That’s a long time to be a fan of someone and to watch them grow and change over the years. 

I love Jungkook’s sincerity as both an artist and human. He’s the youngest in the group, their center and main vocal and was their sub rapper. To carry that much weight in the group at debut must have been insane, their popularity rises up to the skies and he’s still the same humble man he was. He changes his style and gets tattoos but brands his arm with BTS and army front and center. 

Not to mention the comfort he brings fans, whether it’s through [fan songs,](https://youtu.be/_yTP_L8fC-k?si=7crBcxpAYk7tR0qk) [weverse lives](https://x.com/winnttaebear/status/1697251714498429279?s=46) or just [birthday posts](https://x.com/btschartsdailys/status/1697263304714883368?s=46). 

His dedication for music is so admirable, there are people that hit it big and get too egoistical or lazy. But he’s always working on his self. His vocals and dance get better each  year. He tries hard to learn English for Intl fans. 

This probably feels like a ramble but I just wanted to share my thoughts on the birthday boy. Happy birthday JK!

I hope you are always happy, healthy and proud of yourself!",https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/166g2ju/jeon_jungkook_through_out_the_years_appreciation/,Jeon Jungkook through out the years appreciation,kpopthoughts,t3_166g2ju,/r/kpopthoughts/comments/166g2ju/jeon_jungkook_through_out_the_years_appreciation/,2023-08-31 16:39:19,BTS,0.14256015

"Went to the Oct 6th show in Toronto last night and feel very underwhelmed for some reason. Like I expect this man to take his own songs more seriously and at least sing at the right tempo.

Shit was so hard to sing along with because he kept slowing it down or just yelling over it at some parts. 

Also how are you gonna cut off every song like 40 seconds in?

Was it just me or was the crowd in Toronto pretty dead, don’t know if it has anything to do with the ticket pricing but i was sitting pretty close and there was barely any jumping around, a lotta ppl around me were probably like 10 years older. 

Maybe I feel a bit jaded but for a 1000$ concert on home turf you’d expect a good performance and ppl that actually wanna turn up. 

I just wish he’d start and finish songs properly.

"I’m a South Korean myself and I recently learned the news some international fans have considered Jin ugly, which was a straight up culture shock to me. He is a member who fits the so called “Korean beauty standards” the most with V and jungkook coming next. 
Even South Korean antifans don’t dare to attack Jin for his physical attractiveness here. All they can say is he can’t sing or dance which I find partly true. 

Who doesn’t fit beauty standard the most here among BTS members is RM and he has been subject to being teased or bullied by Koreans for basically all his career because of that.
Jhope and sugar are at best considered mediocre, while Jimin is somewhere between mediocre and attractive.
What i’m genuinely curious about is the following:

(1) Do you think this “attractiveness scale” can be reversed / backwards in your own country? 

(2) If (1) Is it true, does the local Beauty standards can go extreme and even consider RM is more handsome than Jin etc.

Whoa anyway I am really shocked if beauty standards in different countries can differ so much and Now I cannot but ask myself how in the world K-pop aesthetics could appeal to general international public in the first place.",https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/18qxe28/the_idea_that_jin_from_bts_can_be_considered_ugly/,The idea that Jin from BTS can be considered ugly is a culture shock to me,kpopthoughts,t3_18qxe28,/r/kpopthoughts/comments/18qxe28/the_idea_that_jin_from_bts_can_be_considered_ugly/,2023-12-26 02:26:07,BTS,0.3127066

"For the past few months, I've seen some people making these narratives about JK: first when we disappeared after the WC, he was depressive/alcoholic/jobless; then when he started doing more weverse lives, he was codependent/manipulative/attention seeking, and now that he has finally made his solo debut, he's chart obsessed/a fraud/a justin bieber clone, usually with shady comments implying that he owes all his success to a certain CEO of Hybe America, sometimes complete with disgusting sexual innuendos.

Of course I try to call out these people when I can, and I am not the only one, but what really brings me comfort in the midst of all these pathetic attempts is the fact that Jungkook, as he [eloquently put it](https://twitter.com/jiminsvkook/status/1682534275990577152), truly dgaf anymore. He used to, bless his heart but this boy used to care way too much about random opinions on the internet, but nowadays you'll find him just [not afraid](https://twitter.com/tteokminnie/status/1682534406253322240) of speaking, [calling out](https://twitter.com/ryuminating/status/1682527819140853760) rude questions, and generally [not letting](https://twitter.com/tteokminnie/status/1682536598376976385) people act like they know him better than he does himself. I love that for him sm and I want to say that it's not just words. People have always acted like they know him better and then act disappointed when he does something that doesn't fit the image they have of him in their heads. Just watch the meltdown that followed the release of Seven. It always make me laugh to see some taking the opportunity to psychoanalyse him and write essays on his character.

The thing is Jungkook doesn't take himself too seriously. The two MVs he's filmed so far had were the most unserious plots and featured his goofy self. He doesn't care about fanwars. ARMYs and Carats were fighting on the TL for dumb reasons and he was singing and dancing half of Seventeen's discography on Weverse. Some fans were mad at a Newjeans's fb for a rude comment and for blocking Seven from getting RAKs and PAKs on k-charts, and he was jamming to their songs in front of his 12M live audience.

His secret tiktok account got exposed and he decided to  make it public, quickly reaching 9M followers and liking every meme vids of him under the sun. He deleted his instagram account because he couldn't to update it semi-regularly, right before he was announced as a Calvin Klein ambassador. He chose CK instead of one of the more luxurious brands  begging him because he knew it was the one brand that he actually wears on a daily basis. People expected him to do the basic white background-underwear posing men ad, but he served androgynous genderless realness and went viral for it.

Tldr: Jungkook will keep doing what he wants, and will be successful while doing it. The sooner people accept that, the better.

"Ed Sheeran I have loved his music since I first heard perfect and photograph on the radio when I was in 5th grade. My biggest hope is one day I will meet him although he is a global superstar with billions of fans. So if I cant have that I could at least share my story on here to other Ed Sheeran fans that love him as much as I do. 

First of all I suffer from generalized anxiety and depression. I am only 16 years old and live with mother and grandmother. My great grandma passed away 5 days after my 16th birthday. Which my birthday happens to be the same day as Jamal Edwards. (August 24th) Ed's best friend. On my birthday I just felt more of a connection to his music after figuring out this information. Then when my grandma passed away 5 days later it hit even harder. Even before the grief hit my body I always took everything from Subtract to heart. It was just like everything I was feeling he was putting into words somehow. With my great grandma death being the first significant one I've ever been through you can imagine what I have been feeling. I felt numb and like nothing was real....I still do since it's only been not even two months. Listening to song like, end of youth, borderline, and life goes on somehow helped me in a way I can't explain. 

Fast forward to two months later. My anxiety in school has always been awful. I have been debating doing online school for a long time when I finally decided I needed to to be happy. I felt very uncomfortable about doing this and then I saw an article pop up. It was talking about how Ed Sheeran didn't even finish school and that school isn't for everyone. Know I'm not dropping out of school to chase some crazy dream. But agian it made me feel a comfort that I'm not the only person in the world experience these things. 

Nobody really understands these feelings I have and why I like his music so much. But I also just genuinely like him as a person. After watch interviews he just seems like a sweet soul. My friends don't understand so I hope some of you here get what I'm saying.

I wish I could just meet him one time in my life and thank him so much for everything he has helped me with. For just make me feel not alone though his music. If you read all of this thank you. And I hope everyone is doing amazing ❤️",https://www.reddit.com/r/EdSheeran/comments/179njbq/ed_sheeran_helped_me/,Ed Sheeran helped me,EdSheeran,t3_179njbq,/r/EdSheeran/comments/179njbq/ed_sheeran_helped_me/,2023-10-17 02:14:18,Ed Sheeran,0.112540044

"With all the Grammys talk, with Yet to Come opening in so many markets and having good results and with the latest Suchwita episode, it got me thinking, how global BTS is. 

I decided to place 8 global acts on Google Trends to see how well they fare compared to BTS during the last 12 months in different countries.

**This is over Google, not Twitter**

Google Trends has the following meaning **""Google Trends is an online search tool that allows the user to see how often specific keywords, subjects and phrases have been queried over a specific period of time.""**

In this case, the higher the number, the better.

So, what we see here is just how big of a presence BTS has global-wise when compared to other artists who may be more known, even while other acts have been more active on the public eye given that they have released new material (Taylor Swift, Bad Bunny, Beyoncé, Drake) or have been touring (The Weeknd, Justin Bieber)

One thing that also surprises me is that none of these countries sans SK has Korean as their main language or even as a strong 2nd language there, which means that people are actively seeking them out despite the language barrier.

I consider it as my second home and I consider my friends as second family. I had several relationships too and they never worked out but that what also makes it memorable.

I love this line from the song the most. It makes me emotional. All of my friends are not perfect and some dropped out of college while others ended up having unwanted pregnancies. They are family to me. These people are strong and empathetic. In my high school I rarely had friends and most girls bullied me but in my university, my friends treated me with love and respect.

"I personally think Drake has a drink problem now. Yatchy said ‘I’ve never heard you this drunk’ & Drake denied he was drunk & for me that was a bad sign, he clearly sounded like he had been drinking.

I think Drake is battling alcoholism & his ‘stomach issues’ statement & taking a break from music is him going to rehab. I’ve thought this for a while, he drinks so freely & the fact he still drops music & does shows is incredible. I think he’s struggling with getting over someone which is why his music is all about what she did & etc.

I remember reading that people watched Drake on the AABT a few weeks back & he was slurring his words & forgetting lyrics & again, that’s consistent with what I’m saying, he has an issue.

I hope I’m wrong but one of the main reasons I’ve always been a Drake fan is the fact he’s never been consumed by the industry & I hope this hasn’t happened.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Drizzy/comments/171pbbe/drake_alcohol/,Drake & alcohol,Drizzy,t3_171pbbe,/r/Drizzy/comments/171pbbe/drake_alcohol/,2023-10-06 22:09:31,Drake,0.30136615

"I might be downvoted for this but I really wanna know everyone's opinions   


Idk why but when I hear it playing in the video, ik it's a mushed up audio and stuff but it sounds like Drake has that lazy flow from Privileged Rappers when saying the Rocky line, also for me personally Yachty's music just sounds boring, he has like very very few songs that could be listened to but nothing great and now he's on the lead single to the album for which Drake's major promotion has been all about bringing back ""Old Drake"". Idk how with features like Yeat and Yachty he's envisioning to do that  
Also Ik it's just a 40 second clip and you can't hear half the words of the song cuz the dude recording was busting a nut on seeing Drake but to me it just sounded like he didn't even put any energy into that song and just mumbled up his words.

"**Ranking BTS Jungkook album Golden.**

1. Somebody/Shot Glass Of Tears. It’s really no competition imho like there’s NOTHING that would stop me from putting this at number one. It honestly feels too good to be on the album without being a single. The riffs?? And that pre chorus?? Masterpiece??
2. Please Don’t Change. It kinda sounds like stock footage audio but I have kinda been addicted. Like actually, it’s become my most played song off the album. I blame DJ Snake for that ear worm of a beat.
3. Yes Or No. it’s catchy and it will get you pumped. Definitely one of my favorites and will get glued to your head.
4. Closer To You. It’s a really good song. I love the vibe. It’s most likely his next single since Major Lazor is in it, and who doesn’t wanna do a song with Major Lazor?? That’d be huge for his career. It’s either this or the DJ snake one next.
5. 3D. I really think this song has grown on me and it’s become one of my favorites. I love how his voice sounds and Jack Harlow’s part is fun.
6. Standing Next To You. I really like this song and glad it was chosen as a single. It really puts emphasis on JK’s vocals and I like that.
7. Hate You. I think a lot of people can relate(if you can it’s probably not good tho). It is an okay song though.
8. Too Sad To Dance. I swear this song sounds like a Justin Bieber song. I think 2016’s ‘Love Yourself’. The only difference is I actually like that song. This song not so much.
9. Seven. It’s good but nothing mindblowing. It’s also become so overplayed that I no longer like it.
This is all my opinion. What’s yours?

"Suga has always known for his producing and rap skills, he also start to evolve in his singing skill. But, in this bts chapter 2, i have realise he really has so much skills and creativity to be in this entertainment industry for the long run. 

From his interviews with [cine21](https://twitter.com/fiytomyr00m/status/1649635296961605634?s=46&t=ePbqT-mBtwVNrsRSh3mIfw), suga reveal that he wrote storyboard for haegeum and amygdala mv himself this time. I think he already realised his skills in this when he scrapped the directors idea for daechwita mv and use his idea instead from the mv set, scar, sword dance etc and gain confidence when the mv is very well received. I honestly think if he have too much free time, he can actually create the 3d animatics for his own mv himself but yeah lets lumpens do his job this time😅.

In [disney+ youtube](https://youtu.be/Kt8VDEY3p2A) content, he said that he got inspired by his childhood hero, sakamoto ryuichi(rest in peace maestro) where he start by doing popular music and changed his genre to be film score composer. Suga said he might follow his mentor’s step too in the future. He already produced more instrumental track these days, [Over the Horizon 2022](https://youtu.be/0IR2dYcyTCs) for Samsung Galaxy ringtone and [In the Seom game ost](https://youtu.be/anvAlOnRbqY). He also revealed in cine21 interview that he already received many offers to make film soundtracks but he turn it down in the meantime but he might accept it in the future. So pls stay tune for suga debut as film score composer in the future.

In iu’s palette, he also revealed that he received an offer for acting job after daechwita mv release. But he turned it down bcs he think he lacks the skills and the visual too. But as we see in [haegeum mv](https://youtu.be/iy9qZR_OGa0), he proved himself again that he is really an actor. We able to see  another actor yoongi on [amygdala mv](https://youtu.be/IX1dkYoLHVs) again. Actually, i think he will do it if the right role come to him.",https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/12xqic9/suga_has_endless_opportunities_in_entertainment/,Suga has endless opportunities in entertainment industry,kpopthoughts,t3_12xqic9,/r/kpopthoughts/comments/12xqic9/suga_has_endless_opportunities_in_entertainment/,2023-04-24 17:47:10,BTS,0.11150667

"have been seeing a lot of posts regarding BTS and whether or not they would disband (saying some members would want disbandment or BTS being involved in disbandment discussions). here are some things to consider if you want to use BTS as an example   
1) the reason ARMYs are so confident that BTS would come back together is that BTS themselves have told multiple times they would come together as a group and perform together. and we trust BTS more than some rando on the internet   
2) ALL the members have stated multiple times that they love being in the group, that they miss the members and can’t wait to be together as a group. don’t believe my words? go read the book, read the interviews they did, watch their lives and their behind-the-scene contents. they stated that they want to continue being a group. the members love and respect each other very much. yes, like every single friend group on this planet, they do have disagreements and fights. but to say they secretly hate each other is simply laughable.  
3) the most important point. BTS is NOT like other kpop groups. other kpop groups have to listen and abide by what their companies say and do. their company control what they do. BTS is not like that. they have full control over what they do, not the company. BTS asks and the company listens. (keep in mind, they are under bighit, not hybe. company management is a whole other can of worms that can be discussed another time)

  
yoongi wants a tour? sure thing   
jungkook wants his solo promotions to be posters of different locations around the world? no problem   
hoseok want weverse album for his solo debut? go ahead   
taehyung wants a show with his actor friends? sure! and here are the resources for it  
if BTS do not want something, they would not have done it. no one is forcing them to do anything. so if BTS say they want to continue being a group forever, no one except BTS themselves would change that.  

(hopefully, this would put an end to the BTS disbandment discussion for a while at least) 

you are welcome to have your opinions but the facts are there so",https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/155ce8d/discussions_surrounding_bts_and_disbandment/,discussions surrounding BTS and disbandment,kpopthoughts,t3_155ce8d,/r/kpopthoughts/comments/155ce8d/discussions_surrounding_bts_and_disbandment/,2023-07-21 03:43:00,BTS,0.11181668
"This thought just occurred to me because I know some groups continue making music (like Exo or Monsta X) even when their members enlist. And some go on hiatus because their age gap is small and won't allow them to continue (like Highlight or 2pm).
But the reason I'm asking about seventeen isn't so much an age gap, but rather the core function of two of its members, Woozi and Hoshi (main producer and choreographer respectively). Do you think they will go on hiatus, so all Korean members will complete service, or they will continue, just with different producer and choreographer for a while? 

(P.s. I know other members are also involved in the production process, but Woozi and Hoshi are the core, so that's why I'm asking).

Also sorry if I'm asking on this subreddit, and not on Seventeen's official one, I did, but there was no reaction to my post.

"I didn’t really listen to bad bunny before last year so I started working backwards through his discography. As good as his newer albums are, I really like a lot of his older stuff.

However I really like songs like: no te hagas, soy peor, chambea, ahora me llama, 200 mph.

"And when Drake’s cue to tear through the drum comes around, he zealously charges at it with infantile enthusiasm.  Curiously, he just runs into it and falls to the ground, knocking himself out in the process.  “Ok, very funny, Aubrey, now let’s do it for real this time.”  Drake doesn’t respond.  “Aubrey, this joke is getting old, get up!” No response.  “Fellas, I think he’s actually unconscious.” “Oh puh-lease! Aubrey is the biggest faker. One time, he called out sick and hours later I saw him on TV rocking out to Weezer in the audience for the Tonight Show!” “That may be true, but he’s actually bleeding this time!” The director looks down at Drake’s forehead “Damn, you’re right!” “What do we do?” “You call 911 and I’ll find out why he got knocked out.” “On it!” The director cuts open the drum with a pocket knife and discovers someone filled the drum up with cement.  “Oh, that son of a bitch!” The director immediately suspects Drake’s arch nemesis Steak is responsible for this.  Flash back to the day where Aubrey Graham Studio’s was holding auditions for the lead roll.  Steak gave a comically lackluster performance and was understandably rejected. “No, please, give me another chance! I’m perfect for this role! I graduated from Juilliard with a 4.0 GPA for gods sakes!” Turns out, he actually ordered four cheeseburgers from a McDonald’s near Juilliard.  “Sorry, buddy, but your acting was three fries short of a Happy Meal.” Days later, Steak reads an article confirming Aubrey Drake Graham got the part.  It was at that moment, Steak vowed to get his revenge.  The scene cuts to the present as the director gets on his knees and yells “STEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAK!” to the sky, and an iris shaped like Steak closes in. 

To ensure they don’t repeat that fatal error, they replace the drum with a paper banner reading “An Aubrey Graham Production: Copyright 1935” Drake attempts to tear through it but gets stuck.

"Lil Yachty is a pioneer for pushing the sound of rap forward for his generation. Early on in his career he was heavily ridiculed for being a “Mumble rapper”. Despite the criticism his melodic allow pitched tone gave us some of the most infectious records post 2016.

Records such as One night, Minnesota, Broccoli, Peek a boo, From the D to the A, Get Dripped, Pardon Me, G.I Joe, Poland, and most recently Strike (Holster).

Yachty is nearly a decade in as a rapper. What is it about him that has kept him so musically relevant to day? Well Yachty is not afraid to test the boundaries of Rap. Playing with different flows, vocal alterations, and always seeming to have a pulse on bubbling scenes/ producers has allowed yachty the ability to always be ahead of whatever trend is around the corner in rap.

He brilliantly debuts this ability on his well received Michigan Boat Boy album, recent singles Poland and Strike and his imprint on the 2022 album “Her Loss”. Yachty was one of the first prominent rappers to embrace the Detroit/flint rap scene and frequently collaborate with leaders of the Detroit/flint rap scene. Names such as Rio Da Yung OG, Sada Baby, Veeze etc. His loosie single Poland became an infectious overnight sensation just from a sound cloud release. This led to him releasing Strike which is one of the best singles of this past year. Both singles highlight yachty at his best. Weird vocals, lively ad libs, distorted vocal effects and bouncy production. 

On Her Loss Yachtys effect can be best heard on standout records “BackOutsideBoyz” and “JumbroTron Shit Poppin”. Where his ad libs and what can presumably be his cadence are used by Drake on both records. It’s no surprise that Drake and Yachty have become a duo in the studio. As Drake is also known to be someone that’s always ahead of the curve in music jumping from Moody Raps, Dancehall, Afrobeats etc.

Yachty being a curator / A&R for Drake has already produced great results in the past and has given more promise for the future. Yachty at 25 years old grew up in the midst of Drakes career and is very familiar with his sound. Pair that with Yachtys cunning ability to develop what’s next in Rap and you have a very promising collaborative partner. 

Baby Keem and Kendrick Lamar are a great example of the dynamic Yachty and Drake have. Through baby Keem Kendrick Lamar is able to make much more lively music that crosses over better than his trans-generational black plight music. Hence why “The Hillbillies” was more well received than any of the content on MMATBS. 

Give Yachty some Grace he just may be the extra push that Drake needs to embrace his roots while still pushing the sound forward.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Drizzy/comments/14o8ney/why_drake_needs_yachty/,Why Drake needs Yachty,Drizzy,t3_14o8ney,/r/Drizzy/comments/14o8ney/why_drake_needs_yachty/,2023-07-01 23:12:34,Drake,0.25462922

I'm genuinely confused I thought it was Purple heart... I've never heard of purple blood... 

I ran into an argument through YouTube comments (I didn't get in it of course) it wasn't worth my time arguing with :)

The argument was over Pinkblood which is SM's trademark since 2021 and then Purpleblood which Armies are fighting about in the comments saying that SM took the name from them... I'm a fan of both BTS and many SM groups. 

I'm just confused on when did BTS become Purpleblood. I did see where Jimin had referred something as Purpleblood but that was earlier this year not before SM decided to trademark themselves. Was they called that before and I just never noticed? I was/still am very active with Armies and SM. Did they change to Purple Hearts?

" 

In the colorful world of music, we all have our unique tastes and preferences. While BTS has taken the global stage by storm, captivating millions with their catchy tunes and energetic performances, I must admit that I'm one of the few who finds it hard to stand their music. In this blog post, I'll delve into the reasons behind my distaste for BTS's music and why it fails to resonate with my ears.

Personal Musical Preferences:

First and foremost, let's establish that music preferences are incredibly subjective. What one person finds melodious and captivating, another might perceive as grating or uninteresting. In my case, the musical style and sound that BTS offers simply do not align with my personal taste

Cultural Differences:

BTS's music is deeply rooted in Korean culture, and as someone who may not have a strong connection or understanding of that culture, I find it challenging to fully appreciate the nuances within their songs. Language barriers can also play a role in this disconnect. While music transcends language, understanding the lyrics can significantly impact one's enjoyment of a song, and as a non-Korean speaker, I often find it challenging to connect on that level.

Popularity and Overexposure:

BTS's meteoric rise to stardom has made them an omnipresent force in the music industry. Their songs are everywhere, from radio stations to commercials, and their faces grace magazine covers and TV screens regularly. This level of commercial success and overexposure can lead to a sense of saturation, which, for me, takes away from the novelty and enjoyment of their music.

Style and Genre:

One's musical taste is often rooted in the genres they naturally gravitate toward. While BTS is known for their energetic pop sound and expertly choreographed music videos, these elements don't align with what I typically enjoy in music. I tend to lean towards other genres and styles, which makes it difficult for me to connect with BTS's particular brand of pop.

Desire for Variety:

One of the joys of the music world is its incredible diversity. There's an abundance of musical genres and artists to explore. For me, listening to BTS often feels like a monotonous experience, and I crave the variety and exploration that other artists and genres provide.

Conclusion:

In the world of music, diversity is a treasure. BTS has undoubtedly made an indelible mark on the global music landscape, and their music resonates deeply with their legions of fans. But it's essential to remember that personal musical preferences are subjective and can vary greatly from person to person.

My distaste for BTS's music doesn't diminish their immense talent, artistry, or the enjoyment that countless fans derive from their songs. While their music might not be my cup of tea, I respect their success and the joy they bring to many. In a world as rich in musical offerings as ours, it's perfectly acceptable to have differing opinions and tastes in music, and it's all part of what makes the music world so wonderfully diverse.",https://www.reddit.com/r/BTSWorld/comments/17bj0vi/my_opinion_on_bts/,My opinion on BTS,BTSWorld,t3_17bj0vi,/r/BTSWorld/comments/17bj0vi/my_opinion_on_bts/,2023-10-19 13:22:46,BTS,0.20172562

"In the rich and variegated realm of musical tapestries, I, with an unfeigned sincerity, confess a profound affinity for the auditory compositions meticulously crafted by the virtuoso known as Post Malone. His melodic oeuvre, a harmonious fusion of contemporary genres, resonates within the recesses of my auditory senses, bestowing upon me a poignant sense of solace and unabated delight.

Hi Kpop fans! I hope it's ok to conduct academic surveys here. I'm crossposting from r/bangtan, but also posting here to reach a wider audience (hopefully).   


I'm currently in grad school (when BTS said they'd enlist in the military, I told myself I'd enlist too...in some classes) and my research partner and fellow ARMY thought it would be fun to make BTS our research topic for this term!

With that, I'd like to ask for your help in [**answering this survey**](https://forms.gle/NVTVmRHn4nVXghCX9)**.** More info on the study is disclosed in the form, but the TL:DR is we want to learn more about ARMYs' propensity to purchase things we've seen BTS using or the boys have said they use but don't endorse—this includes Jungkook famously selling out TEAZEN's Kombucha drink, or Joonie's book recommendations being referenced in bookstores globally.

Rest assured, we will **not be collecting any contact info**—I think Google Forms prompts you to sign in sometimes, but we don't have visibility on your email addresses! We're also only collecting demographic data because we're required to do descriptive statistics, but that's the extent of the personal data and how we'll use it. **This data collection is solely for academic purposes too.**

If you have any concerns or questions, feel free to shoot me an email, which is included in the survey form! You can also comment if you wanna discuss anything or have survey feedback :) Me and my research partner would def appreciate it! If you can, too, send to your PH moots, friends, and...fam?

"Saw a really interesting Twitter thread about why OVO Fest is happening this summer. 

Quick Points

1. A FIVE-day gap on “It’s All A Blur Tour”.  

2. Budweiser Stage not having any other concerts during that same time period.  

3. Lil Durk, Rick Ross, Central Cee, Dave are in Toronto around that time.

"Hello. I do not know how to word this, but I have been a Bieber fan for 2 years now after going throughout most of my life hating on him. However, I did not really pay attention that much to my favorite artists last year. I really do not want to get a whole lot into this, but I have a few reasons. I think the first is that you feel so confined just listening to your favorite artists, and I am someone who likes to explore different music genres and artists. In fact, if you asked me to name my top 10, 20, or even 500 favorite songs of all time, I would not be surprised if this list did not compose of most of my favorite artists. I also feel like I started to get burnt out with music and stan culture. Music is something we hear everywehre, whether it be on YouTube, a streaming website, in commercials, in stores, restaraunts, radios, offices. I started to notice that I was just hearing the same things everywhere, which kind of soured how I felt about music. As far as Stan culture goes, I actually made a Stan Twitter account for Bieber, as well as for other favorite artists of mine, and I did not like the experience. Yes, I did like getting to speak to other fans, but it was not worth it due to the overall toxicity that this platform offers. Yes, I know that Reddit isn't any better but at least it is not too toxic. Plus, this subrreddit is not as big as other subreddits that I have lurked around. So, at least that is a good thing. With 2023, I decided that I should go back to music again and listening to my faves. So, I just wanted to know if there is anything that I missed last year. I would say that I stopped tuning out around April-June. I know that last year STAY and Ghost were still big chart toppers and some of the biggest hits of last year, Bieber put out 3 new songs(Attention, Honest(I have only listened to this one and I do not really like it), and was featured on a song from Kehlani's album last year), Bieber cancelled his tour and was diagnosed with Ramsey Hunt syndrome, Hailey and Selena are actually friends(Oh really, who would have thought? NOTE: Jelena vs Jailey is one of the reasons why Stan Twitter was a bad experience for me), Bieber attended the Grammys as he was forced to by the Academy and did not want to go, and that Bieber is planning on selling his masters. Did I miss anything else? Please help a fan out. Also, do you think we will get a new album this year? Bieber did try to release an album again last year because I remember him saying that his next album was almost done and I also saw photos of him recording it in 2021. In addition, he did release Honest for the album even though that kind of underperformed. Again, did I miss anything? Thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTINBIEBER/comments/102b2le/did_i_miss_anything_last_year_and_what_do_you/,"Did I Miss Anything Last Year, and what do you think will happen this year?",JUSTINBIEBER,t3_102b2le,/r/JUSTINBIEBER/comments/102b2le/did_i_miss_anything_last_year_and_what_do_you/,2023-01-03 15:34:55,Justin Bieber,0.25462922

"Drake had invited a few of his closest friends to a secret dinner at his mansion. They arrived at the sprawling estate, which was hidden behind a thick wall of trees and bushes. The guests were greeted by Drake's butler, who led them through the ornate halls and into the dining room.

As they took their seats, Drake emerged from the shadows, wearing a black suit and a sly grin. He raised a glass to his friends and began to speak.

""Welcome, my friends,"" he said. ""I've gathered you all here tonight for a special occasion. You see, I have a secret to share with you.""

The guests leaned forward in their seats, eager to hear what Drake had to say.

""I've been working on a new album,"" he continued. ""And I need your help to make it perfect. I want you to listen to some of the tracks and give me your honest feedback.""

Drake's friends nodded eagerly, excited to be a part of the creative process. They spent the rest of the evening listening to Drake's new music, discussing the lyrics and melodies, and sharing their thoughts.

As the night wore on, the group grew closer and more connected. They laughed, told stories, and enjoyed each other's company. And when the meal was over and the last song had played, they left Drake's mansion feeling inspired and energized.

Little did they know, Drake had one more surprise in store for them. As they stepped out into the cool night air, they were greeted by a spectacular fireworks display, lighting up the sky with bursts of color and sound.

It was a night they would never forget, and they knew that Drake's secret dinner would always hold a special place in their hearts.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Drizzy/comments/12yrhrs/drakes_secret_dinner/,Drake’s Secret Dinner,Drizzy,t3_12yrhrs,/r/Drizzy/comments/12yrhrs/drakes_secret_dinner/,2023-04-25 18:21:56,Drake,0.11912931

"Hi guys,

I've been seeing a lot of the cards for this 101 card set on ebay and depop but the card backs vary so much that I'm confused about which are real and which ones are not. I know they are not really expensive cards (even though I'm seeing the Jungkook ones sometimes selling for $4/$5 dollars each which seems steep) but basically I don't want to potentially buy fake ones. Is it meant to be that each member has a different card back for the set? I honestly can't tell because all the backs looks different and I haven't been able to find a clear reference except the one I'll attach but even then I'm not sure.

Can someone that owns the cards confirm what the card backs are meant to look like?

Thanks.

"Looking at the recent updated charts,, i feel somewhat livid knowing V is the most popular member of the group and still tanked in charts. His solo stans reasons were (1) it's unpromoted, (2) B-side, etc WHEN i just know it's a bunch of excuses because dreamers by jungkook is unpromoted too, was leaked a day before the official release, BUT still did better. Hell, even the hyung's line did better whose considered the least popular members. 

Although BTS as a whole is BIG and will def do better in charts and streams, it's a different story when it comes to their solo releases. So I'm expecting that the most popular members will DO good and will break records after records ESPECIALLY Taehyung. I'm not angry with the armys, I'm just kind of disappointed because I expected more upon seeing Jungkook's results and even Jimin's.  V even had a countdown in his instagram w/ that much followers but it didn't help. 

As someone whose biases are Jungkook & Taehyung, it's kind of disappointing how armys, especially taekookers seemed to prioritize JK over taehyung when it should be balance in supporting them. However, it's a different story when it comes to their solos. I figured JK has more solos and wider solo fanbase but i doubt the disparity between V and JK's solo fanbase is that big for Taehyung to tanked like this.

What could be the other reasons why Taehyung's debut is underwhelming? I'm starting to believe these are the results of his dating scandal with Jennie.",https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/15oaacf/taehyung_v_debut_got_underwhelming_results_i/,Taehyung (V) debut got underwhelming results.

"Just want to share my thoughts and opinions on AUSTIN. I used to be really big Post Malone fan in the beginning of his career but the past few albums I felt were just okay. When I first heard this album I fell in love with it immediately. Let me know what y’all agree or disagree with.  I feel this is one of his best albums and want to discuss and see what everyone else thinks!



1)  Don’t understand — 9/10
Beautiful song… great choice to put this first on the album.  “And I’m cold, so hold me” gives me chills every time I listen to this track. I love the scratchy soft vocals and the slow cords. Post is really diving into his insecurity struggles. 


2) Something Real — 10/10
This song is actually perfect. The production is top tier. Really shows how diverse and creative he is as an artist. A lot more upbeat track and the choir in the background gives the song a gospel vibe. His flow in verse 2 is classic Post. 


3) Chemical — 7.5/10
I like this song, it’s catchy and a more feel good track on the album. However it’s definitely a typical radio song. The lyrics throughout the song and vocals on the chorus are great. Wasn’t really drawn to this song as much as the others though. 


4) Novacandy — 7/10
This song is okay.. not a fan of the chorus. Lyrics aren’t great. However I really like the drums on this song and the transitions from chorus to the verses. The intro also stood out to me. I think this song will get better the more I play it. 


5) Mourning — 8/10
The production, chorus, vocals are all really great in this song. Another feel good song. The lyrics are the best thing about this song in my opinion. We see a repetitive theme with his addiction struggles. He protrays his truth growth in this song by saying he doesn’t like the party lifestyle anymore and being surround by fake people which he’s been opening up about and trying to get out of that scene


6) Too Cool To Die— 8.5/10
Production on this song is immaculate. The beginning of the song gives me a huge rush of nostalgia. I love the chorus and the transitions are wonderful. Just a beautifully written song. This song just really makes me happy. How can you hear this song and not like it?


7) Sign Me Up— 7.5/10
Another classic Post song. Amazing chorus that’s super catchy. Just a great song to sing along to… “Some might say, some might say” I really like that part. However I haven’t been playing this track as much as the others for some reason. 


8) Socialite— 9/10
This track is one of my favorites on the album. The production is top tier. The drums that come in after the bridge are amazing and such a great transition. Vocals are heavenly on this track. “I’m calling her shrek cause she got a donkey” what a bar. This why we love Post.. his versatility as an artist is on full display on this track. 


9) Overdrive — 10/10
I did not hear this song before the album. The first time I listened to it i shed a tear. This song is perfection.. vocals, production, & lyrics. Pure nostalgia in this song, I fell in love with this track immediately. This might be my favorite one on the album. I get Band of Horses “No Ones Gonna Love You” vibe in the beginning, chorus and at the end with the whistles. The length of the song is perfect as well and happy it was not drug on another minute. This song makes me happy and sad simultaneously. Pure emotions in this track. 


10) Speedometer— 7.5/10
I like the direction he took for this track. Very unique but I feel it’s still kinda classic Post? Simple & catchy song that I feel should be paired with a sunny day driving in the car with the widows down. Probably why it’s called speedometer. I feel like the track is just okay and not much else to say on it. Production and melody carry this song. 


11) Hold my Breathe— 10/10
One of the most beautiful songs I’ve ever heard. Another perfect song. I cry to this song everytime. Pure raw emotion just floods from this track. These types of songs are what made me fall in love with Post. The guitar and vocals are crazy good. This is Post at his best. This song will be remembered for a very long time. 


12) Enough is Enough— 9.5/10
This one is probably going to be a lot of peoples favorites and for a reason. Lyrics and production are top tier. This song makes me feel uplifted and I’m so glad he put it after “Hold My Breath”. The chorus is what really makes this song amazing though. One of his best Chorus on the album. 


13) Texas Tea— 7/10
I feel like this is the worst song on the album but it’s still a decent track. Production and vocals are good. I just don’t really enjoy the lyrics and it’s a shorter song. Nothing really stands out to make me want to play this song over others. 


14) Buyer Beware — 7.5/10
I didn’t like this song at first but it’s been growing on me the more I listen to it. I don’t think there’s anything special about it though but the chorus is good. 


15) Landmine — 10/10
This is the most underrated song on the album and hasn’t been getting the recognition it deserves. This song sent me into a trance. Such a beautiful song that touches your soul. One of my favorite Post’s song production wise. Beautiful song that gives me chills every time. This might be a top 5 Post song ever written. I could listen to this song everyday for the rest of my life. This is proof that Post is one of the greatest generational talents to exist. 


16) Green Thumb— 9/10
I love this song so much. Beautifully written song and story. The guitar and vocals are so soothing. Such a sad song but Post’s voice is phenomenal and makes me constantly comeback to this track. 


17) Laugh It Off — 9.5/10
This song gets better everytime I hear it. Post shows a little bit of everything on this track. Verse two is one of the best verses on the album. Vocals, production & lyrics are all perfection. This song is going to age like fine wine. The outro was AMAZING and there couldn’t have been a better way to end the album.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PostMalone/comments/15e6slf/rating_all_the_songs_on_austin/,Rating all the songs on Austin,PostMalone,t3_15e6slf,/r/PostMalone/comments/15e6slf/rating_all_the_songs_on_austin/,2023-07-31 05:11:59,Post Malone,0.11357342

"I’ve been a Bad Bunny fan since 2016. I went to a party and Soy Peor was playing and I was hooked since then. He’s been my top artist every year, but I always knew that he was an underdog and he was no Freddie Mercury or Residente. I didn’t become his fan for his angelic voice or deep lyrics. I obviously love how much he’s grown and how he’s evolved since 2016, but I feel like the fandom holds him to a standard he didn’t have back when he was an upcoming Soundcloud rapper, asking him to be the most politically correct artist and a role model. Some of y’all should remember how he started and where he’s come, and if you’re worried about “the kids” then be a better parent and make sure your kid has healthy role models. I’m just tired of people dragging him for doing SOME of the stuff he sings about.

"

I spend a lot of time thinking about content strategy, and I’m really curious what the BTS game plan will be for content when they reunite in 2025. (I’m pretty sure they have their plans already mapped out up until then, because they’re just that intentional and strategic.) 

So, just for fun, let’s imagine what their content plans might be, in several different categories:

- General vibe 
- OT7 content
- Wild card (something unexpected!)
- Personal projects? (For one or more of the members)

My take, to get things started!  

**General vibe:** laid back, we got this, no need to prove anything to anyone, we’re here for the long haul 

**OT7:** As a group, they have periodic EPs every 1-2 years that are mostly OT7 tracks, with solo work continuing under their individual names. They also record an occasional Bangtan game-mukbang evening that features much chaotic laughter, an occasional “back in the day” story they feel comfortable telling now,  inevitably ends in them all singing together (with copyright clearances arranged so we can actually hear them!) 

**Wildcard (something unexpected):** Hoseok spearheads a project where they read stories for kids. Each member is recorded narrating a favorite story, and children’s organizations get free copies of the books they read. Occasional subunits record stories, too. 

**Personal project:** Namjoon starts an occasional video series featuring up and coming indie artists across multiple artistic genres, who also get exhibition and performance space at his new mixed media gallery (I’m thinking of him as kind of a one-man MacArthur genius grant kind of patron and benefactor, but more actively engaged in supporting younger, emerging artists)",https://www.reddit.com/r/bts7/comments/113fzxr/bts_content_plans_for_2025_and_beyond/,BTS content plans for 2025 (and beyond?),bts7,t3_113fzxr,/r/bts7/comments/113fzxr/bts_content_plans_for_2025_and_beyond/,2023-02-16 02:46:31,BTS,0.10002319

"Not MY person opinion, but something I saw posted on X (twitter). Much of Jungkook’s success is attributed to the pop genre he chose to follow artistically. Others seem to believe he is popular enough to chart any song regardless of genre. Taehyung, however, pulled great numbers in spite of the niche music on Layover. I am by no means suggesting Taehyung “flopped.” Taehyung is/was arguably the most popular member, and Jungkook could have very well eclipsed him. Comparing these two is interesting, and I’m curious to see if this is indeed an unpopular opinion.  

 I think this maybe an unpopular opinion because army tend to prioritize western accolades and charts. I don’t think a korean jazz ballad would have charted the same way Seven did.",https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/17r06db/respectfully_jungkook_would_have_charted_layover/,"Respectfully, Jungkook Would Have Charted Layover Songs With No Problem",kpopthoughts,t3_17r06db,/r/kpopthoughts/comments/17r06db/respectfully_jungkook_would_have_charted_layover/,2023-11-09 00:23:44,BTS,0.15600902

"Help, I (F15) have this girl, M(F15) who I dated 1 1/2 years ago and have been in love with this whole time. She’s an amazing person who can genuinely make me smile no matter the situation. A mutual friend said that she was getting tired of waiting around for me and wasn’t sure how much longer she can play cat and mouse with me.
 
She’s saved my life more times than I can count, all my firsts have been with her and I can’t see myself loving anyone else but her. 

We initially broke up because my parents were uncomfortable and I was worried about the consequences. They still are tense whenever I mention her too.

The tricky part is I go to a catholic school, while not having and strict rules about lgbtq. I get ridiculed and made fun of by peers and girl who I play sport with as well. I’ve gotten a lot more used to this over the passed few years but it still bothers me. And I’m not sure if it’ll get worse if I get back together with M.

My Dad is catholic and is against gay marriage as it isn’t what the bible ways (cliché I know). My mother is supportive of everyone else but doesn’t understand where I “went wrong”. I talked about it previously but she wants me to explain why I’m gay. I can’t, there isn’t a reason. We live somewhat rural so anything I do has to go through them. I’ve been laying low lately so it hasn’t really been an issue. They support me in every other way though, but this is the one part they can’t. 

I’ve spoken with my mum about it and she says she won’t be comfortable with it, and most likely won’t support me. The closest to supportive was when she had a few wines and said it was my choice.

I’m stuck on what to do. I really don’t want to loose M, they mean a-lot to me but its hell having my parents uncomfortable and unsupportive towards me. I don’t know what to do. M asked me today what the hell we are and whats going on between us. I just need somebody’s perspective.

TLDR; I’m struggling to choose between getting with the girl of my life and loosing my relationship with my catholic family and some friends.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/12v0e79/help_i_being_a_gay_catholic_teen_is_sometimes_v_e/,HELP!

"Hello there! With over 12+ hours of different fav soloists & K-indie/R&B artists on my playlist, I really wanted to write about a few of my absolute favorites & whom I listen to the most. Even though I try to listen to all the artists on my playlist equally bc they're so amazing & some soloists are underrated. So without furtherado, I wanted to start with Kim Jongdae, aka, Chen. 

Chen has always been known for his vocals and impressive singing control, ability to hit incredible high notes and even low tones as well. He is a singer I would definitely want singing lessons from and he even tries to improve even more himself. He has said in one of his listening party episodes for Last Scene last year, that, he didn't want to only be known for hitting high notes..or be the ""high note singer"", which even though it's recognized, his singing is WAY more than just high notes. You can just hear and listen to how freaking stunning his singing his vocals and control are in his albums & songs! A few songs for example: [I Don't Even Mind](https://youtu.be/xt_kv3YUoUY), [Hold You Tight](https://youtu.be/W71gqyA15Uk), [Amaranth](https://youtu.be/zHlDvTcu5us), [Cover by Chen](https://youtu.be/hmhL5DdhY6s)

His albums are mostly..well..all ballads and soft, soothing songs with lots if emotions and hope. I think they're really good and great to listen to literally any time of the day. My favorite album is probably Last Scene, which honestly gave me a scare bc of the name of the album at first lol but I feel like to me, this album is like a step up from April, and a flower & Dear my dear not to say the other two aren't amazing, they are! Chen has evolved and grown more as an artist, a singer & a songwriter and it's so nice to see how much between his 3 albums. Chen said he wanted to be known as Kim Jongdae in his albums rather than, Chen. He wanted his albums to seperate Chen, the EXO member and Kim Jongdae/Chen, the singer and soloist. 

Chen deserves so much love and support, he is so talented and not only can he sing like an angel but he can rap and dance too (which his dancing is kinda underrated imo lol but that's besides the point). If you haven't heard or know of Chen/Kim Jongdae, I honestly find that impossible but I would highly recommend checking his music out, his albums are wonderful and so beautiful to listen to! 


The next solo artist I wanted to talk about is, Kwon Jin Ah, I love her! She is a K-indie/R&B artists and debuted with her 2016 album [One Strange Night](https://open.spotify.com/album/2NIHcafPBpwE9exKTsSWrr?si=bJcFQEChQ1qwA3-KsVLm5w&context=spotify%3Aalbum%3A2NIHcafPBpwE9exKTsSWrr) which is great first impression album, her vocals blew me away & I feel like zigzag was a perfect opener for it. She started her music career on the SBS competition show 'Kpop Star 3' in which she got 3rd place! She at first wanted to debut in an K-pop idol group but changed her mind as she thought the demanding physical lifestyle wasn't for her and went solo instead. 

She has 3 full albums, One Strange Night which I mentioned above, Shape of Me (2019) & The Way For Us (2021). One EP called The Flag which released this year on March 2nd. The reason I love Jin Ah so much and her music is because of what she writes about- it's not all love and romance but being strong, not doubting yourself, giving hope, motivation and encouragement through uplifting lyrics and songs, and also as a woman too. 

Some of my favorite of her songs are: [Something's Wrong](https://open.spotify.com/track/3ctGT9T08w6VnpND1zhPTW?si=63Bdf8hbTgOl9T0J2tLeEQ), [Fly Away](https://youtu.be/OARgsIKS8VU), [6:35PM](https://youtu.be/x-v9ZefEdos), [These days](https://youtu.be/9amGcW8QccY), [Butterfly](Nighttide](https://youtu.be/N9s15H1UF08). Her lyrics have hidden meanings and some are deep but sung beautiful & full with heart from her. Jin Ah has also done many OST's and collaborations in her career which has also been a driver in more popularity for her. Some notable fans of hers are Jihyo (Twice) and Irene (RV), even Bangchan listened to Something's Wrong in one of his lives! 

All her songs are so beautiful, heartfelt and give you comforting vibes. I can't wait to see where she goes from Raise Up The Flag and more amazing music from her! Please give Kwon Jin Ah a listen if you haven't she is awe-inspiring, at least to me. 

The last but NOT least solo artist I wanted to appreciate and talk about is Bily Acoustie! Real name Hong Jun Seob, Bily is an K-Indie/ballad artist and debuted with his single, For A Rest in 2013. I first got into Bily from his OST for one of my favorite Kdramas, The Miracle We Met (which is really sad). One of the things that I love about his discography is how he has these numbered Edit project singles & under each edit single is a different song like: [Edit. #01](https://open.spotify.com/album/6LxQsWbtcof6sWbBrGU0Ou?si=sQ8nhL-wTLuSxyUq0onaOA&context=spotify%3Aalbum%3A6LxQsWbtcof6sWbBrGU0Ou), [Edit. #02](https://open.spotify.com/album/6wVZX0c9sNZHadtPUd7hof?si=rzegl_JpRCeuEcqP2GDMOg&context=spotify%3Aalbum%3A6wVZX0c9sNZHadtPUd7hof), [Edit. #03](https://open.spotify.com/album/2r8XbqN7jN8xxFN3NCde3r?si=76hgsLsVTpyv6Zvf9-wYoA&context=spotify%3Aalbum%3A2r8XbqN7jN8xxFN3NCde3r), and you get the point it just goes on. He put out 5 edit singles in 2018, the combined those songs into one [Edit](https://open.spotify.com/album/3fPL620JaVICMNJDh0gqbo?si=Uk-hTHo7SOauWT7xAQe5fQ&context=spotify%3Aalbum%3A3fPL620JaVICMNJDh0gqbo) album in 2018. 

He has made two more Edit singles since then in 2021 called, [Edits. #6](https://open.spotify.com/album/6bKSuguOqPd0HFsshcjTAP?si=C-5gdDDoQJSPhIGMARlHjg&context=spotify%3Aalbum%3A6bKSuguOqPd0HFsshcjTAP) which has two of my favorite songs of his Fine Day & I'll be by your side. Also put out [Edit. #7](https://open.spotify.com/album/6x6Q2IqJJ5mgRQDWoEKbzT?si=PiLKaiG7RxKUKdxy6jr9MQ&context=spotify%3Aalbum%3A6x6Q2IqJJ5mgRQDWoEKbzT) later in the year 2021 in June. 

Bily has sung many OST's for dramas, most noteable [Monochrome](https://youtu.be/Wc4RtfxPKS4) from Miracle We Met, [Request](https://youtu.be/ZPnMeGKaPp8) from Time Pt.5, [I'll be with you](https://youtu.be/h8IkA-qRPI8) from another hit idol drama At Eighteen. Though my favorite OST of his, is, [Growing](https://youtu.be/ZgkUBfnaQ40) from Love Interference season 2, it's so beautiful and sweet! Honestly just like all of them. 

Bily's voice when he sings is so warm, calming and has that homey feel, especially with most of his songs. They make you just want to cuddle up in a blanket and write or read, maybe chill with a cup of coffee. I say it a lot but I really do love such soft, cozy ballad songs and especially when they're sung with care, emotion and like they mean it, and Bily Acoustie does that. I can absolutely guarantee that if you are the same as me and love K-indie, soft, slow, comforting ballads then you will absolutely love his music and him. 

Now I just want to list off a few of my favorites from him: [No Reason](https://open.spotify.com/track/2I0YGyXdCKdsaV8m3KLXnt?si=8XOxXVMoQ-uP268sPBTFZQ), [For You](https://open.spotify.com/track/62svDED0RDF9unzKgMOWEs?si=p0LqDaFnRju4ZcIkF1JBsQ), [Re:start](https://open.spotify.com/track/5VN7I51lBteRedMTQODRPN?si=xo10FohZS16r4LwP1BIbkg), [A Stranger](https://open.spotify.com/track/3evvRAyWkNNHlkyIEAf43X?si=zgNOuV-9QZ6pE3RSQAusmQ), [To you](https://open.spotify.com/track/6OLqpz785uRCVFMe0dUCMT?si=dQVMOyzvTAONB4NlAOFSZg)

"So here's the deal. I have been a blink since bp debuted. And an army since BST era. Since 2016 to be precise. I miss the way things used to be back then. The blink fandom was moderately small but energetic. Not many toxic people, not many solo stans, and great friends with other fandoms. 

In fact armys and blinks used to have a collab fandom name at that time called armyblinks. We used to die for interactions between our favorite idols. And yeah there was the usual cringe shipping between the two groups but still it was ignorable. 

But then as years passed both the groups started gaining HUGE popularity. And while Army retained some of their good character. The Blink fandom went straight into gutter. The amount of toxic people? Solo stans? Misogynistic people insulting on other ggs? I started to hate what we had become. And the thing I hated the most was how strained the relationship became with other fandoms, especially armys. 

And it was so sad cause we really had them by our side for so long. And all my hopes of having a bts and bp collab ended right then cause no way in hell would they ever come close with their fandoms constantly at their necks. 

But anyways as a fan who is still stupidly hopeful, I truly believe some kind of collab between bts and bp would bring little peace between the fandoms.",https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/10j3lvx/i_believe_that_a_collab_between_a_bts_and/,I believe that a collab between a BTS and Blackpink member will bring some peace between their rival fandoms,kpopthoughts,t3_10j3lvx,/r/kpopthoughts/comments/10j3lvx/i_believe_that_a_collab_between_a_bts_and/,2023-01-23 04:20:43,BTS,0.20572066

"Yo.

I've recently gotten VERY into Post's music after being mostly a metalhead for my life. B&amp;B and HB are amazing albums, but I wanted to know which melancholy song do people prefer from each album. It's close for me, but I think Stay edges it.

"Drake and his mischievous entourage are playing timeless staples of recess such as tag and soccer.  Drake is having a good time, until he notices a sharp pain in his abdomen.  Drake shrugs it off and continues gallivanting about until notices the abdomen pain reoccurring.  “Aubrey, is everything alright? Are you hurt?” Drake doesn’t want to look like a chicken in front of his chums.  “Yeah, I’m okay! Had a little too many mozzarella sticks for lunch, y’know.” “I hear that! They do go hard!” Drake continues about his school day getting progressively more hurt and nauseous.  When he gets back home, Drake’s mom notices him limping and vomiting.  She sends Drake to the doctor at once.  Drake absolutely despises going to the doctor.  He always imagines he’ll subject him to a myriad of unethical science experiments.  “Good afternoon, Mrs. Graham, what seems to be the emergency?” “Be honest with the doctor, Aubrey, he’s here to help.” Drake tells the doctor the truth because he secretly wants to the pain to go away “Oh, dear, we better give you an x-ray.” The doctor takes his x-ray and confirms that Drake’s appendix is swollen.  “So, what do I do about it, doc? Chicken noodle soup? Ginger ale? Pepto Bismol?” “I’m afraid it’s not that simple, Aubrey, you’re going to have to have an operation.” Drake is absolutely floored upon hearing this an immediately imagines ridiculous scenarios such as the surgeon decapitating him and stringing his organs on a cello and playing his funeral march.  “You’re gonna have to be a brave boy, Aubrey.  I know you can do this.”  “We’re going to schedule his surgery on the 30th.  Anytime after that would be too risky.”  Drake then spends the rest of the month pretending he’s in perfect health, but of course no one is buying it.  And when the day of the surgery comes, Drake is scared out of his wits.  “Oh geez, I better write my will now!” Drake thinks to himself.  “I leave my Pokémon card collection to… myself.  And I leave my Nintendo Switch to… myself as well. And-“ “Aubrey Graham to the operating room.” “It’s time, Aubrey, you can do this.”  Drake is noticeably nervous on the operating table.  “It’s okay, son, we’re going to administer anesthesia.  You won’t feel a thing because you’ll be asleep.”  The doctor administers the anesthesia and, in an instant, Drake is knocked out.  He then has a dream where he imagines himself as a superhero who saves the day.  A crowd enthusiastically chants his name.  “AU-BREY! AU-BREY! AU-BREY!” Drake wakes up and discovers it was just the doctor calling his name “When does the surgery start?” Drake asks “it’s over! You did it, buddy!” “I did?” Drake smiles and continues to live his life free of pain, where he learns surgery isn’t so scary after all.",https://www.reddit.com/r/DrakeTheType/comments/135s0vk/drake_the_type_of_ill_philbert_to_be_enjoying/,Drake the type of ill philbert to be enjoying recess at school,DrakeTheType,t3_135s0vk,/r/DrakeTheType/comments/135s0vk/drake_the_type_of_ill_philbert_to_be_enjoying/,2023-05-02 16:01:31,Drake,0.37073207
"Hi everyone! 

Since Pleasing doesn’t offer returns and doesn’t do reviews, I just wanted to share my experience with the clothing as a plus size person since I know how hard it can be to choose a size. 

I personally have found Pleasing’s sizing to be pretty inconsistent, which sucks due to the fact that you can’t return things, there is no permanent brick and mortar store to try things on, and the prices are steeper. 

I do think that for what you’re paying, the quality is nice for most everything I have. The hoodies and crewnecks are heavy and feel really nice and are my favorite apparel products from Pleasing. 

My measurements are: Bust- 50 in, Waist- 46 in, Hips- 53 in and I am 5’ 0”. I wear a 2x in most things and can sometimes be between a 2x and 3x. 

Sleepover shorts: I got these in a 2x and a 3x. The 2x was uncomfortably tight but fit. The 3x were still a tighter fit, but weren’t uncomfortable. I would suggest sizing up 2 sizes if you want a looser fit. These have an elastic waistband, but the fabric doesn’t have much stretch at all. 

Heavyweight drawstring hoodie: I got this in a 3x. This fits very comfortably and is nicely oversized. The sleeves are a few inches too long. I would say the sizing runs normal to slightly larger. 

The House Pajamas: I got these in a 3x. The description does say to size up. These fit but were not as loose as I would like. I would size up 2 sizes for these. These are like a silk material and don’t have much stretch at all. I also felt like the quality of the fabric wasn’t as great as the other clothing items I have. They didn’t feel like $200 pajamas in my opinion. 

The Pleasing Hoodie in Pink: I have this in a 3x. It fits comfortably, but not an oversized fit. The longer/more I wear it, it seems to stretch to a looser fit.

The Pleasing T-shit in Sunshine Yellow: I have this in a 2x. It fits very comfortably and is a looser fit. It is quite long though. The fabric is thicker and feels like it’s very good quality. 

The Pleasing Crewneck in Sky Blue: I have this in a 4x. This was the only size available when I bought it during the first release. I would say this fits pretty true to size. It’s comfortably oversized on me. If I were to order it again I would order a 3x for a loose fit. I wear this regularly and have found that the frog graphic has faded quite a bit so I would definitely turn it inside out to wash. 


I hope this helps someone! I know how devastating it can be to save up to buy something and it not fit.",https://www.reddit.com/r/harrystyles/comments/18txzje/pleasing_plus_sizes/,Pleasing Plus Sizes,harrystyles,t3_18txzje,/r/harrystyles/comments/18txzje/pleasing_plus_sizes/,2023-12-29 21:29:36,Harry Styles,0.2667042
"This is not to try and start any kind of hate towards any members or anything. I am genuinely curious as to who everyone thinks will have the most success as a solo artist. I am going to rank my personal opinion (as an ex army) but please let me know who you think will be the most successful as a soloist,obviously none of them would flop and would all be fairly successful.


1:Jhope- his solo stuff both times blew up tremendously and had a lot of people talking about it. He’s got a fun energy and has the ability to showcase the 3 top things people look for rap,dance,and vocals. I feel he will have probably the most successful career solo.

2:Jimin- he already has at least 1 really big name in K-pop having wanted to work with him (Taeyang bigbang) and his solos from previous albums are usually the most liked. He has a very pretty voice and is an amazing dancer as well. He will have a very successful solo career as well.

3: it’s a tie between V and Jungkook honestly- they both are already very popular members. They have the most solo stans as well it seems so i look for them both to have fairly successful solos when they do release their solos. V may not be as popular as jungkook in korea tho because he suits a kinda R&amp;B blues maybe jazzy type sound imo which isn’t really isn’t all that popular in Korea.

4:Suga- he isn’t usually the most popular but out of him RM and Jin id say he’s probably the most popular. He has a very clear distinct sound to him and a very set style that does well for him. He won’t be as successful as the other 4 above as he doesn’t dance a lot and he doesn’t sing which is what most K-pop fans gravitate to with at least when it comes to soloists. He will be pretty popular with the K-hiphop fans tho.

5:RM- again not a very popular member compared to the others in BTS(tho even the least popular members have more fans that the most popular of some groups) again probably more popular with the K-hiphop fans rather than most K-pop fans as he doesn’t sing or dance when he’s solo at least not very much anyways.

6:Jin- Jin is probably the least popular member unfortunately. He still will have a lot of support behind his solo activities once he is discharged. Unfortunately as he isn’t the best dancer (observation not attacking) and really fits more slow songs I don’t foresee his solos being as popular as say Jimin or Jhope.


Now I could end up being very wrong with my idea and I am ok with that. Who do you guys think tho will be the most successful as a soloist?",https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/10dpnbc/as_bts_start_their_journey_as_solo_artists_who_do/,As BTS start their journey as solo artists who do you think will have the most successful solo career?,kpopthoughts,t3_10dpnbc,/r/kpopthoughts/comments/10dpnbc/as_bts_start_their_journey_as_solo_artists_who_do/,2023-01-16 19:56:22,BTS,0.20149297

"Okay, here we go. Just to get it out of the way, I generally do agree with the sentiment that ""BTS paved the way"". While I do think that the work that 1st and 2nd gen idols did to initially bring Kpop to the international stage shouldn't be discounted in any way (PSY, Wonder Girls, etc.), I think that BTS had the longest-lasting impact on the relevance of Kpop in America and the West in general. I could say more about it, but in the briefest of summaries, I think many of the opportunities that groups have now would not have been possible without them. With that out of the way, I think it needs to be said that a majority of people who use the ""BTS paved the way"" argument as a way to minimize the success of other groups need to really think about what they're saying for a second.

So, Stray Kids just had their [first song to chart on the Billboard Hot 100](https://www.billboard.com/music/chart-beat/stray-kids-hot-100-debut-lalalala-1235500331/), with ""Lalalala"" debuting at No. 90 and I am so proud of them! This is something that the members themselves have expressed as a goal for their career and I'm so glad it was able to happen. What I don't appreciate is the sheer amount of people that immediately tried to discredit them. And I hate to be that person, but it's mostly Armys. And yes, I know that ""not all Armys"" are like that and that most fanbases are much worse in any online space, but the amount of Tweets I saw saying anything from ""No. 90 isn't even that good"" to ""X member of BTS charted higher"" was just... it was a lot. But I think what I saw the most of was this idea that ""BTS paved the way and that's why Skz was able to do this so they should be thankful.""

So what I want to understand is what people hope to gain by using this argument. By saying ""BTS paved the way"", you are implying that they paved the way for something to occur, and in my opinion that 'something' is the ability for other Kpop artists to have the same opportunities as they did. So no, I don't think it's fair to claim that a group did none of their own work to achieve something or that they're copying BTS by wanting to win a Grammy because that is just what happens when you are the first to do something: you're the first, but you're definitely not the last and others are going to want to follow in your footsteps. I do respect and admire the hard work that BTS has put in to get to where they are now, but their fans really need to check themselves when they get mad at other groups for using the path that BTS paved because that's kind of the whole point, right? Am I missing something here??

If you think I'm way out of line with this one, please let me know but I'm really hoping this sub understands what I'm trying to say here. In conclusion... I think I need to delete Twitter!",https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop_uncensored/comments/1813sl4/i_dont_think_people_understand_what_bts_paved_the/,"I don't think people understand what ""BTS paved the way"" actually implies and I'm tired of it.",kpop_uncensored,t3_1813sl4,/r/kpop_uncensored/comments/1813sl4/i_dont_think_people_understand_what_bts_paved_the/,2023-11-22 07:42:15,BTS,0.10870059

"As of recent news, RM got caught in a scandal where he reposted Frank Ocean's song ""bad religion."" The song itself contains lyrics that are seen as islamophobic according to Muslims.  

As a Muslim myself, I am offended by the song indeed and disappointed that RM did something like that. 

Now I have seen some kpop subs calling the news irrelevant or that ""twitter people"" are triggered again.

Honestly, this is the only sub I can go to regarding this topic, but even then I'm unsure whether or not I should have posted this. I just want to rant my frustration in a safe place and I'm unsure whether me being a Muslim and being offended is acceptable in this sub.

"**╔═══════════════╗**

*Today BTS member Jimin released his first mini album. I've enjoyed all the solo stuff BTS members have done since the group went on hiatus. I'm curious to see what sound and style Jimin will bring to the table with this record. I hope Jimin will get an enjoyable album like RM and J-hope did last year. Even though this project isn't that long, I'm still hoping it packs in many killer moments. So now, let's jump into this album and see what Jimin brought.* 

**╚═══════════════╝**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cbvl2gri2rpa1.jpg?width=2102&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e75da645a3b3f84b1fc507c3e5c9de91dcabc8ae

**Face - Jimin**

**1.**[**Face-off**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLT_MqzRHfY)

*This record opens with sounds of people talking before Jimin comes into the mix. The synths and guitar blend well with the overall vibe as Jimin brings in slick vocals. I like the trap vibe; it works well with the overall performance. I remember hearing this track for the first time and forgetting what it sounded like immediately after it was over. I like the backing track accompanying Jimin, but there could be more meat to the bones. Jimin's smooth voice helps open up the record with a welcome, as it excites me even more for the rest of the album. Face-off isn't my favorite song on the album, but it's still decent.* 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3jrxbm2v2rpa1.jpg?width=1548&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5cc8851a2f5ea4fb031d1caf01881c7331eaa5f3

*»»————- ♡ ————-««*

2.[Interlude : Drive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUIRGc_53IY)

*Right after this project's opening, we enter an interlude that doesn't bring much to the table. Instead, most of the interlude is an instrumental with Jimin talking and crowed sound effects in the mix. I don't mind there being an interlude on the album, but I wish there were singing than just talking and ambient effects. So again, I don't know how this song connects to the overall project, but from an instrumental point of view, it's beautiful but only does a little for me.* 

&amp;#x200B;

3. [Like Crazy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOI67IDlNMQ&amp;list=OLAK5uy_kfk5qQMVWGQHFm6aKsm98uJeNjJRSa7uo&amp;index=3)

*The title track on the album is a funky-pop tune we've heard before in pop music. Jimin sounds excellent with this funky backdrop, making this my favorite song on the album. The synths craft this 80s sound that almost has a synth-wave feel, which kept bringing me back for more. Again, Jimin sounds smooth as his vocals performance is on point, making this an enjoyable tune for this record. I won't say this is the best track ever, but for a Jimin solo, it's a decent one that I can return to. We also got an English version, which was an excellent addition to the record, as Jimin sounds great in English.*

*»»————- ♡ ————-««*

4.[Alone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q9UDPZuTi0)

*A beautiful piano melody opens the track as Jimin brings in soft vocals that move the tune forward. I love the guitar moments that help craft the chill vibe the backing track delivers. I find myself super relaxed as I'm listening to this tune. We get some synth-sounding elements during the pre-chorus and hook, which don't take much away from the track. This tune sometimes sounds dull, like they could've added more to the production. I'm not the biggest fan of this song, but it works well with the artist and fits the album wonderfully.*

5. [Set me Free, Pt. 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wko5wTh0Heg)

*The pre-release single we heard last week is my least favorite solo BTS has delivered. The autotune vocals are cringy, making me dislike the track. The chorus is not doing much for me as it feels empty for my liking. I wonder why we needed Autotune on the vocals, as they sound better without it. It sounds like Jimin is trying rap which we don't even need, as he could do better. The backing track is OK; it brings trap vibes and choir backup vocals. I have yet to listen to this song since it dropped last Friday since it leaves me super disappointed in the mess Jimin brought to the table.* 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lxa1568l3rpa1.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=452148201547d5ad67ba36e7d6fb068b28cef9f0

**╔═══════════════╗**

**Summary:** *Jimin released his solo album, and I have to say it only delivers two songs I like off the project: Like Crazy and Alone. The face-off song is decent but feels forgettable, as I am trying to remember what it sounds like after it ends. Set me Free is super cringy with the autotune that leaves me disgusted. Even if we've heard funky-pop before, it works well for Jimin, making that one of the best moments on the whole record. Face by Jimin is my least favorite thing from the BTS solo stuff. I hoped this album would be good, but it was a huge letdown.*

"This is kinda a sub where you can share everything so why not just tell y’all this? If you don’t care then scroll.

So it’s 2017 and my sister and I were kinda just learning k-pop dances, I mean I was doing easy ones like ’Knock Knock’ by TWICE, which is legit just knocking, I did like some boygroup songs but not the dances as they were too hard. My sister however was a big boy group stan so she got a little bit prideful. She tried to dance to ‘Monster’ by EXO and she did a really good job, it was going okay you know but then she wanted to try some BTS, this is where it all went sour. She tried to do ‘DOPE’ first of course and it didn’t go too well, I advised her to stop but she kept going. She then decided to do that dance move where they jump up at the chorus in ‘Blood, Sweat and Tears’ which is a very fitting name for what happened. She legit fell and hit the edge of the table and broke her arm, she was also bleeding and her arm was definitely broken, and she was also crying and sweating. She laughs at it now and she even went into dance so never give up.

Lesson: don’t learn the dances to boy groups songs in k-pop.

Thinking Austin might be a great album even though I’m a posty “banger” fan. Saw him in time square and flying down to Dallas from PA to be in the pit for his first show there (pit Hollywood is bleeding and 12 karat toothache). I am a big fan of beer bongs and Bentleys and stony so I really wanted to hate this new direction but I think I’m in on it. Just needed to get this out there. Not sure if anyone else is in this camp or wanting him to stick to the bangers but I really did want to hate Austin.

"It’s been a year and I barely skip a song

Almost every song is playable in the summer and fun even if the song writing is corny, it’s the most fascinating and interesting he’s sounded

I think because it’s Drake people rushed to laugh at it and fit in with the narrative. My mind does wonder what would happen if another artists released it they’d probably get more praise for trying something different

I also think Drake’s perception of being the guy can take a joke and be on the end of one sometimes contributes to how his music is perceived?

"Hi all! I have recently been listening to Ed Sheeran. Like everyone I know his radio hits but started getting in to his music more a few days ago after I spontaneously bought tickets to his Philly show on Saturday. He's got so much depth to his craft and I'm kicking myself for not apriciating it sooner! 

I did buy a general admission ticket but there is no section or seat number on it. Is GA just like a pit style set up? Or will I be getting a seat?

"Hey guys, 

It has been a time since I have been on Reddit, but there is something that I wanted to talk about. I have still been lurking on Reddit, and I follow r/Toddintheshadows. For those who do not know, Todd in the Shadows is a music critic who does reviews of current pop songs(Pop Song Review), failed albums that ended an artist's career(Trainwreckords), reviews of one-hit-wonder songs(One Hit Wonderland), and year-end lists of the best and worst hit songs of a given year. Now, Bieber has appeared on many of Todd's videos through reviews(Todd has reviewed Eenie Meenie, Yummy, and What Do You Mean in a vs. review with Shawn Mendes's Stitches). Also, Bieber has appeared on some of Todd's year lists, which I will discuss later in this post. Recently, someone asked a question on the subreddit about good songs by bad artists. Someone mentioned Bieber, and I wanted to ask you guys some questions that have sadly been on my mind about Bieber and how people perceive him on this day in 2023. 

1. Do you think Bieber is a bad artist? 

Now, I know most of you will say no, and I even say no too. So, let me reword this. Why do you guys think people think that Bieber is a bad artist? People only focus on his bad songs. I know I am coming off as biased, but Bieber does not have that many bad songs or albums. Off the top of my head, some of his bad songs for me include Baby, Yummy, First Dance, Honest, Second Emotion, etc. Regarding bad albums, I do not like both My Worlds and Changes. But these two records have good songs like Somebody to Love, That Should Be Me, Overboard, One Time, Love Me, Intentions, etc. 

Now, this next question comes from the response of the OP to the person that stated Bieber. The OP said that they do not support Bieber due to his controversies. The OP pointed out the incident when he ignored a disabled fan and encouraged fans to mass-stream Yummy and get it to #1 by cheating the system. I thought the first incident was fake and a celebrity impersonator pretending to be Bieber to that fan, or was it him? I also heard that Bieber was not even mad at the impersonator for what he did. The second incident is something that I can not defend. But the same goes for other artists who have found ways to cheat the system and encourage their die-hard fans to mass stream the Billboard Hot 100 chart system and cheat to get a song to a higher position. An example of this is recent, with Taylor Swift releasing many remixes of Anti-Hero, and BTS did the same thing with Dynamite. This is where my second question comes in. 

2. Do you think Bieber is a bad person? 

Now, I know most of you will say no, and I say no too. This is because Bieber was involved in many controversies from 2009-2014, such as being racist by saying the n-word, peeing in a mop bucket and shouting F Bill Clinton, being a nuisance to his neighbors, etc. Even after these years, Bieber still found himself in controversies, such as the Yummy mass streaming or the time in 2019, doing NFTs, or even defending Chris Brown and calling him better than Michael Jackson and 2Pac combined. But Bieber is always the first example to be pointed out when it comes to celebrities being bad people or doing bad things. I am not defending his actions as what he has done is wrong. I believe in second chances and moving on before canceling people, which Bieber has done. Plus, most of these incidents occurred when he was younger. If he were racist or a nuisance at 29 now, that would raise some red flags. What about other controversies that Bieber's contemporaries have been involved in that are as bad, if not worse? Some examples include the following: Ariana Grande(donut-licking incident in 2014 and black fishing controversies in 2019), Taylor Swift(under fire for being a polluter last year), Cardi B(admitting to drugging and robbing men back when she was a stripper and before she became famous and being proud of doing so), Nicki Minaj(her husband's controversies and her anti-vax tirade in 2021), etc. I am just pointing these things out. I am not trying to pit these artists against each other. Most of the artists I mentioned have a lot of music/songs that I like, including but not limited to the following: Style, Anti-Hero, Lavender Haze, Blank Space, Bartier Cardi, Finesse (Remix), Girls Like You (remix), Chun-Li, Super Bass, Barbie Dreams, Thank U Next, and a lot of the singles off of Sweetener and My Everything, to name a few. Most of these celebrities I have mentioned have also done a lot of good things, like the following: Bieber\[Holding the #1 Make-a-Wish record before John Cena and still being in touch with the organization and the story of Avalanna(RIP)\], Taylor Swift\[letting fans come into her house and have listening parties for them by treating them like they are her friends(I have even seen videos online of her visiting fans homes and sick fans in the hospital too)\], Ariana Grande\[her handling of the 2017 Manchester Bombing situation and how she got over Mac Miller(RIP) and his passing in 2018\], Nicki Minaj\[telling her fans to stay in school(Barbz stay in school speech)\], and Cardi B(the way she treats her daughter Culture if you have ever seen clips of the two). At this point, these guys are celebrities who simultaneously care and do not care about us. The issue here is to separate art from the artist. I at least tell myself that Bieber is not as bad as someone like Tory Lanez(who shot his ex Megan Thee Stallion in the foot) or R Kelly(who did the following: pissed on underaged girls, tried to marry underage girls, tried to recruit Ethiopian woman to come back with him to the US at a concert one time, and a whole lot of other messed up incidents). FYI, I would stop supporting Bieber if he did something as heinous as Tory or R Kelly, considering how these two were grown men when they committed most of their crimes and not teenagers or young adults like Bieber. I don't know, but that is just me. What do you guys think?   

3. Do you think people still hate Bieber? 

This is the final question that has been on my mind. This is in terms of Bieber's music and personality. As I mentioned, one of the comments in the Reddit thread has someone stating that they still think Bieber is a terrible person. Plus, I know no one is perfect, and Bieber has still had recent controversies, as I have already stated. As far as his music goes, some people still do not like his music or think that he is a lousy artist. Some people still put him on the same bar as other bad artists, like 2010s Maroon 5, Kid Rock, MGK, Meghan Trainor, Luke Bryan, FGL, 69, Shawn Mendes, Views-onward Drake, Peter Cetera era Chicago, etc. Again, Bieber is not a bad artist. I was one of his haters who thought he was a lousy person who made awful music. Only two years ago, I discovered he is not that bad, musically or personally. I am an RYM user, which is also why this question has been on my mind. On RYM, all his albums, except for Purpose and Journals, are rated below 2.0. Also, a lot of his songs, both old and new, are below two stars. Anthony Fantano put Changes and Justice as his worst albums for 2020 and 2021, respectively, on his year-end worst list. Changes could be a better album, as there are good songs. But it is not really that great. As far as Justice goes, I first thought it was alright, not too remarkable, and a bit of a disappointer. I was still coming out of my Bieber=bad phase, and the album has grown to the point where I like it. It is what Changes should have been, or at least done right. In addition, the album is a part of his holy trinity of Purpose and Journals, but the weakest one probably sits at a 3.5/5 for me. I also found it baffling that Justice made it over other bad albums by bad artists of that year. Two big snubs that should have taken its place on the list include Maroon 5's Jordi(Maroon 5 just made another generic pop album and keep on making the most basic and banal top 40 pop ever since their downfall days of Overexposed/V) and DJ Khaled's Khaled Khaled(DJ Khaled just made another generic album in which he assembled all the current day big names of Rap, Hip Hop, and R&amp;B and made another forgettable album that combines all of these genres, probably without him producing and having his ghost producers do all the work without receiving proper credit). I also noticed many Bieber songs make it into Fantano's worst tracks during his weekly roundups. Going back to RYM, I even think that Journals and Purpose are rated too low at 2.32 and 2.48, respectively, considering how these are some of his best albums. Todd in the Shadows is still not big on Bieber, as he was always his most hated artist since he first came out. As far as recent years go, Bieber appeared on Todd's 2020 worst list two times, two more if you count honorable mentions, and once on his 2021 worst list. For 2020, 2 of those songs I do not like(Well, one of them is just alright but could have been better). But the song on his 2021 worst list is one of my favorite Bieber songs. The only positive YouTube music critics towards Bieber are ARTV, Roomie, and Mic The Snare. ARTV gave Justice a 3.5/5, even changing his score on Purpose from a 3 to a 4 in 2021. Roomie is usually very positive towards music, which I like, even towards hated musical artists and songs. For instance, Roomie enjoys a lot of Nickelback, thinks The Chainsmokers Don't Let Me Down is better than the Beatles song of the same name, and criticizes songs in a way that is still positive and does not sound negative. An example is when Bad Blood, a Taylor song I do not like, and many of her hardcore fans appeared in one of his videos. He gave a positive criticism about how this song's beat sounds like something you would find in a Paramore or FOB song and how it does not suit Taylor. Roomie also positively reviewed Kendrick's verse even though it is alright(no pun intended) and not one of his best(He was just on the song to remix it and make this song more popular than it already was on the charts). I bring this up because Roomie liked Justice, as stated in one of his videos. Now, Mic The Snare. I do not think he hates Bieber. Again, he is another positive music critic. But I do not think he is too big on Justice too. This is because he paused in his 2022 Grammy video when reading the nomination for Justice for AOTY and stated Peaches is a good song. Also, in his album roundup reaction to this video, I think he was fine with this album, but just a little bit turned off by the MLK sampling. He also praised Purpose as a stepping stone in 2015-2016 music. This was because it set the stone and switched the first half of the 2010s music scene to the second half by bringing tropical pop music into the mainstream and showcasing what the later 2010s would be like. He even compared this record to what Justin Timberlake's Future Sex Love Sounds did for the 2000s, which is another record I like. From this statement, I think he likes Purpose and indirectly stated that he was not too big on Changes, which I agree with. Again, this guy is another positive YouTuber who always finds a way to say something nice when trying to say something bad without coming off too negatively. He made a DDD on Maroon 5 and discussed their current years without harsh resentment. So, that is something, and Mic and I would like a Bieber DDD, please. I am getting sidetracked here, but we need more Roomies and Mic The Snares. As it is, I am not a big fan of YouTubers who are too negative and make their whole personality, like Mr. Enter. I do not know why I am letting this bother me. I hope his next album, which I hear rumors about coming out this year or next, is excellent. I hope that it is his best. I also hope that Honest is not on this record. I was not too fond of this song, nor did some music critics, like ARTV or Fantano. Allegedly, that was his lead single for his next album, and I am hearing rumors that it would come out last year as he stated that this next record was almost done. I am glad it did not since I would not have liked it if it had more songs like Honest. Plus, I do not think it would have done well, as songs from the Justice era were still big around this time, like Ghost and STAY. I hope this new record proves he is a good artist and person. I am also afraid about how Bieber's legacy will be shown. I fear he may end up like Journey, Bon Jovi, Chicago, or Aerosmith. These were all big artists of the 70s and 80s that were not well-liked during their prime. However, revisionist history and survivorship bias has made these artists become well-liked due to them still being remembered from a musical decade, that is well-liked and remembered. From what I have heard, Journey was just the 80s Nickelback, 80s Chicago was just 2010s Maroon 5, Aerosmith, mainly 90s onward, could also be considered 2010s Maroon 5, and Bon Jovi was just never liked with both their older and newer records. I guess Journey just kept making the same kind of music repeatedly, and people got tired of that and started hating them. Aerosmith and Chicago, like Maroon 5, both bands started well but were then on the brink of irrelevancy. However, these bands became relevant again by making a hit song that was completely different from their initial sound and kept on making songs similar to this song and other bad music, thus ""sell-out."" For Aerosmith, this was I Don't Want To Miss A Thing. For Chicago, this was Hard To Say I'm Sorry. For Maroon 5, this was Moves Like Jagger, but I do not think they got bad until Daylight and Love Somebody. Again, Bon Jovi was always seen as bad, both with their older and newer records and how they have been trend hoppers. In the 2000s, they worked with in-demand teen pop Max Martin to return to the pop world with It's My Life, which sounds like a rejected Backstreet Boys song, all pop-rockified. Besides this, they hopped on the failing rock band/artist, or even artists from other genres, like Jessica Simpson, going country trend by making the bad song in 2006, Who Says You Can't Go Home. Also, their latest album, 2020, was not well received. I am getting sidetracked again, but I hope Bieber does not turn out this way. Part of the appeal of Purpose was that the people who would bully this kid and pick on him in 2010 are now the ones listening to his music and becoming newfound fans of his five years later. But, 8, even 14 to an extent, years later, it still seems that it is cool to hate on him, both on his music and as a person. Will it ever end? Again, what do you guys think? I know I stated a lot, and thank you so much for reading all of this if you have made it this far.

"As well as interacting with other fandoms, knowing that nothing good will come from insulting them? 

It boggles my mind with this mindset. And with reporting people who tweet obviously low-effort hate comments? It's pointless to report 'bts suck' 'bts don't deserve success' etcetc. Every army who have their account dedicated to protecting the members have tweets saying to report these types of tweets. Why can't the reports be used for actual, severe hate, like death threats?
 I keep quiet about it, as seeing others who do say something like this, you'd think the person was threatening awful things to BTS. I just don't understand it. Am I actually missing something to the army-code? Lol.

"I'm not the type of person who cares about numbers much. But kinda tired of seeing many comments about mass buying/mass streaming. It's 2023 but still people believe you can chart a song 2/3 years straight because of mass streaming.

Like be real at least. We are not bots. We are real people. We have our own lives. If we can chart anything with mass streaming then yet to come didn’t have to leave the chart after 56 days meanwhile songs like dynamite charted 780 days. I don't even know how any song could get 610k paks by mass streaming or could chart 6 years straight. I have seen people are now downplaying their concerts numbers by saying that same rich armys have attended multiple concerts just to boost bts revenue 💀. Every kpop groups are now doing 10/20+ versions( it's their personal decision. I'm not against it) but I'm pretty sure if bts did many versions like them then we would have post like how bts is destroying the environment.

Anyways I'm not saying armys don't mass stream. Of course, they do. Armys are notorious streamers. But they themselves couldn't maintain longevity many times. Armys always make 24hr and 1 week goals but after that it's upto gp/casual listeners which song will mantain longevity. This is why rapline solo works and some bts songs like On,Yet to come, Black Swan didn’t maintain much longevity. 

 I'm sure if any kpop group can break bts spotify records then everyone will say how organic they're. I don't understand the double standard here.

now, i believe there were tons of comments asking him about it and i'm 100% sure it was because of the video. bh and him have not acknowledge the video yet and we'll see in the incoming weeks if bh ever would. if we see them say they will sue, then it's him definitely. 

i get that the fans have no business asking him about his private life but i honestly wish he didn't say armys are his girlfriend. he already does weverse lives that kinda play into the ""boyfriend"" delusions a lot of armys have. and i understand it's all for fun but i'm pretty sure idols, including him know the possible reactions of fans when they do this kind of fanservice.

i wish he would just set the record straight and say, no he is single and left it like that...no need to say your fans are your girlfriends.

"TL;DR - hip hop albums are LONG and sequencing has suffered. Scroll down to see my version of FATD (very subjective; I’d encourage you to read my reasoning if you have a different opinion).

Won't get approved over at HHH but maybe yall will appreciate this
___

I feel like I’m in the minority in this day and age, but I miss the days when we would get concise & cohesive albums. It’s obvious a lot of artists are just throwing everything they have at streaming services to boost numbers, and while this is great for fans wanting to squeeze everything out of their favorite artists’ discography, ALBUMS as a packaged piece of art have suffered greatly.

What constitutes an album as good? Is it the quantity of good tracks? If mediocre tracks are then added, does the overall quality decrease? Do songs need to be connected thematically, sonically, or conceptually? This is certainly up for debate, but I am of the opinion that for an album to be considered good, it needs to be considered as a whole body of work, from start to finish. Say good-bye to the album shuffle. Listening to an album from front-to-back is one of the best ways to consume music as an art.

This also means sequencing matters, which has also suffered in recent years (especially in hip-hop). Along with a high quantity of songs comes more complexity when deciding how to sequence things. Throwing 3 interludes on a long album doesn’t always help, although they are warranted when helping the flow of an album.
___

If you’ve made it this far, and you’ve read the title of the post, you might see where I’m headed - I’d argue Drake has been at the forefront of this movement with some of his work:

**Views** - *20 songs, 1hr 21min*

**Scorpion** - *25 songs, 1hr 30min*

**CLB** - *21 songs, 1hr 26min*

**FATD** - *23 songs, 1hr 24min*

Not only are there a large quantity of tracks, these runtimes are long. Again, my opinion: ~30min to 1hr is the sweet spot for albums; anything longer starts to blend into playlist territory (to Drake’s credit, “More Life” was deemed a playlist, and you could make an argument the other pieces I listed above could be considered as such).

I’ve started to consolidate super long albums into bodies of work I think would:

* Be more consumable over a shorter period of time
* Flow a bit better across the tracklist
* Highlight the highs & mitigate the lows

Thus making, what I would consider, to be a better “Album.”
___



**Additions:**

*Scary Hours 3* - I personally love all 6 of these. I’m just a sucker for rap Drake. Cole/Drake trading bars is a huge highlight, and I’m also loving the Alchemist/Conductor/Yachty production on these. This is what a lot of Drake fans have been asking for, and I’m grateful he delivered.

*Search & Rescue* - Some think it’s a snoozer, but I think the tone perfectly captures Drake’s “Search” (even if it’s the same thing he’s been telling us the past 10 years). I’m also surprised it wasn’t included on the initial album, given it’s popularity.

*Unfortunately, adding these 7 songs means we had to remove a chunk -*

**Removed songs:**

*Calling For You* - I love 21’s verse & instrumental, but imo this is 3 songs in 1. Not a fan of the skit.

*Fear Of Heights* - Two rage tracks back to back was an odd choice, and not one I’m fond of. I opted for Daylight (s/o Adonis)

*IDGAF* - This is a fantastic Yeat track, but I’d argue it doesn’t belong on the album. Again, still glad this song exists.

*Bahamas Promises / Tried Our Best / Drew A Picasso* - Initially the hardest part of the album for me to get through. I love sleepytime/vibey Drake bars, but 3 in a row is difficult to stomach, especially when other tracks on the album capture the same mentality but better.

*Members Only* - The instrumental and PND’s verse are mesmerizing, and the hook is an ear-worm, but personally I get tired of the melody after some time.

*All The Parties* - Same issue as above. Same 3 note melody, across the entire song. Sucks, because I actually enjoy Sosa’s verse. 

*BBL Love* - Feels less like an interlude and more of a throwaway studio session, albeit across a smooth instrumental.

*Gently* - IMO, dancehall just doesn’t fit on this album.

*Another Late Night / Away From Home / Polar Opposites* - Again, 3 similar tracks in tone, just not much exciting going on to close out the album.

**Sequencing:**

Generally, I tried to keep the order of the initial tracks in place, while sprinkling other tracks in. Some highlights:

Disc 1~ *Virginia Beach / Amen* is probably my all-time favorite 2 opening Drake tracks. Classic relationship woes Drake, followed by an excellent feature in with Teezo. *The Shoe Fits* is a great standalone track and these 3 are fantastic openers, each have their own story/theme, and aren’t too intense. Immediately, these are followed by 2 hard hitting tracks. *7969 Santa / B.A.R.K. Interlude* is a much needed breather before jumping into the next portion of the tracklist.

Disc 2~ *Slime You Out / Search & Rescue* serve as some lead singles, and compliment each other very well thematically (themes of being used, searching for someone better, etc….. but again, you can prolly say this about a lot of drake tracks). You could argue *Red Button* furthers the shot-taking that’s alluded to in *Search & Rescue*, thus placing them back-to-back highlights what Drake is trying to say (in general, i’m not a fan of the subliminal half-dissing Drake does, so anything to improve on his inability to be direct helps his themes here). *Stories About My Brother*: “This is the decompress before the intermission”... quite literally a decompress from some more emotionally intense tracks, directly before *Screw The World Interlude.*

Disc 3~ If anything, this is the cruising portion of the album. Nothing too specific here, just some great tracks (and imo, 8am is an all-time great). *Evil Ways* into *You Broke My Heart* is an excellent way to close the album. We get bar-trading reflections of Cole/Drake’s careers, followed by a seemingly celebratory (sonically) track, where Drake seems to come to terms with a past relationship.

"Will Drake's Next Album Be His LAST?

When will Drake fall off? Has Drake already fallen off? These are questions that have been asked for years and it still seems that Drake is on top. Drake has had 12 number one albums and with his new release of For all The Dogs it looks like he will lock in his 13th number one album. Drake also has 12 number one hits and is just one away from tying Michael Jackson for the most number one songs for a male solo artist. Drake is in a whole other category than any other rapper in the industry right now. So today I will be answering the questions when will Drake fall off?

"Taehyung's first song for his solo album is out and yeah everyone (including me) is freaking.

What I love about this music video is how minimalistic it's. It's just him, a Mic and his voice on stage. It was more of a Performace video than an actual music video? Or it's just me. Anyways I love the music video a lot.

- Can we also talk about his gorgeous that man is? I know that he's handsome but everytime he impress me, in a good way. His blonde hair and that shirt dress omg it was perfect.

- His voice? It suite this genre of music so much. Like if you say Taehyung's voice, I'll think of jazz, rnb and slow pop no in between.

The song is so him. It's perfect for him.

Now into what I dislike:

-first of all, I wish if he use his lower register more. The song will feel more pleasing if it was his lower register for me.

- I felt awkward watching him. Maybe because I've never seen him alone for a music video. Okay singularity exist but again I'm just not used to see him alone ig (he's damn hot tho)

-the refrain could have a different melody? I can't describe it but it feel empty or missing something for me. And if the song is produce and compose by him, I can feel the same missing thing in Chrismas tree and Sweet night where some of the melody are just not fit.

That's all.

"Hey everyone. As the title says, I'm trying to sell some pcs that have been wasting away & taking up space. I've tried selling them on Ebay & Instagram, but seems like nobody wants them on there, so I figured it was time to move to reddit.
The PCs in the red box are SMCU & a limited
Japanese PC, so I'd like to sell them for 10€ each.
All other PCS/Polas I'll sell for 4€, the group PCs/ID for 2€. I'm also willing to give them to you for free if you buy 3+ other PCs. 
In general I'm fine with offering a lower price to those buying in bulk, I really need the space they take up.

"incoming album tangent‼️
PROOF in general to me is iconic because it's an anthology album ( meaning it includes songs from previous eras &amp; albums) reminding yall that their old songs DO still exist. you don't have to say you miss them, because google music, spotify, soundcloud and youtube are all right there.

lets talk about the main 4 songs on proof; 
for youth is a direct call-back to young forever both the song and album, born singer is a remake of one of their very first covers and yet to come is all about reflection of their past music &amp; being grateful for their career up until now (also looking forward to the next chapter and ehat's to come). run bts ties it a up in a pretty bow with solidifying their artist of the generation status.

 it's such a revolutionary album and i think it ends this argument because i might be the only one who thinks staying in a box or not experimenting with sound is a bad thing. i think bts has taken nothing but progressive steps for their discography, evolving both their sound and as artists. i don't think you can say there is an 'old bts' in terms of music because as someone who has been an army for just under a decade, their music has changed yes but they've stayed true to their vision and remain authentic. concepts are also supposed to change otherwise it gets old very quickly.

anyway, that's just some food for thought lol.",https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/10f47f8/proof_ended_the_whole_bts_new_music_sucks_argument/,"PROOF ended the whole ""bts new music sucks"" argument",kpopthoughts,t3_10f47f8,/r/kpopthoughts/comments/10f47f8/proof_ended_the_whole_bts_new_music_sucks_argument/,2023-01-18 10:34:43,BTS,0.112643376
"I’ve been a fan since Post Malone’s early days. His August 26th mixtape really gave me the respect of who he is as an artist. Stoney, soon after, even accelerated that claim. I enjoyed B&B, but not as much. Hollywood’s Bleeding had a few tracks I enjoyed, but I always compared his earlier albums and couldn’t listen to them as much. His previous album before Austin I never really got into. 

Austin is an incredibly, top tier, well produced album. It’s one of my favorite listens of an album that I’ve heard in a looonggg time. He absolutely killed it. Almost every single song is just… great. I cannot get over how wonderful it is.

"Eds Minneapolis performance will be the first time I'm seeing him live. I have been waiting SO long to see him live and to say I am excited is an understatement. I also haven't been to a concert I really care about since before smart phones were a real thing. I do want to be fully present but I'm also a person that enjoys reliving memories. I also have 2 young children who are also little Sheerios who will not be coming to the show and they've asked me to record  their favorites (which are a lot) for them to hear later. Anyways. I'm just curious what people do at concerts nowadays. Can you even truly enjoy yourself if you're holding onto a phone? If you're someone who records do you go back and watch? I will be in the seats, not GA so I'm assuming I won't have a super amazing view of him worth recording. 

Also for some strange reason the Minneapolis gig is far from sold out which makes me quite sad because other venues are having record breaking amounts of people show up for him and I think everyone here knows he is truly amazing.  So I'm wondering if it'll still be fun to be in a huge stadium that's half full.",https://www.reddit.com/r/EdSheeran/comments/157i8oj/not_sure_if_i_should_record_or_put_my_phone_away/,Not sure if I should record or put my phone away?

"Happy Wednesday, r/bts7! 💜 This week, we’re trialling something new - Would You Rather Wednesday. 

**It’s simple: leave your WYDs down below in the comments and then let others leave their reasons of what they’d rather.** 

The classic example is, would you rather 5 x Jungkook or a 5-year old Jungkook? But your WYD can be song-related, content-related or absolutely whack. For example:

* Would you rather be in an episode of Bon Voyage or In The Soop?
* Would you rather have BTS *finally* perform Paradise or Louder Than Bombs?
* Would you rather go for a bicycle ride on a super hot and humid day with Namjoon or have a 3 hour gym session with Jungkook where he goes all out?
* Would you rather metal concept Bangtan or country concept Bangtan?
* Would you rather have a sneak peak into the Genius Lab and listen to unreleased songs or have a sneak peak at Hopefilm and see pictures from over the years?

The more silly, lighthearted and absolutely abstract, the better. Plenty of links to evidence is highly encouraged!

"First of all, the songs aren’t bad by any means for me but they feel incredibly simple (melodically and lyrically) and formulaic. Eyes Closed is definitely the “pop hit single” that Ed was looking for which led to it being incredibly formulaic. Boat is fine but 1/3 of the song is the same repeated lyric and the rest of the song isn’t particularly deep. The production has also been incredibly lacking. 

I know we were all wanting an acoustic album but I was hoping for a lot of emotion (Give Me Love, the man, Lego house) and/or be original in composition (photograph, castle on the hill, etc). These two songs just feel very basic lyrically and compositionally. 

Let me know if I’m the only one or you agree!

"I was watching some video and a stoner in the comments section said
 
‘you don’t miss old counter-strike, you miss being happy’

And I thought, fuck, that’s a good way of describing nostalgia, from the Greek ‘nostos’ for the ‘road home’, and ‘-algia’ to make it a pain for the road home. 

Maybe it ironic that someone talking about a video game I cared only mildly for could hit so hard, that something so trivial could spark such emotion. 

How can we trust ourselves if we cannot even define our happiness; we know it’s finite and yet we chase it indefinitely. We know the past isn’t perfect, yet we idealise it. 

We must be the only creatures to be allergic to happiness. 

Maybe… maybe if people knew that there was no salvation in the past; no romance to history… Maybe if we each individually remind ourselves that now we live better than any emperor in history, free of worry of persecution, disease and famine. 

Maybe then we could learn to be content: kill desire, vanquish dukkah… end suffering.

"Not that anyone cares, but I’ve definitely gone back and forth on what I honestly think happened the night Morgan wallen cancelled his last show. I think a lot of people seem to forget two things can be true. I definitely believe that he wasn’t feeling well and struggling with his voice prior to that night. HOWEVER, I also believe instead of taking care of himself he went out partying that night. Obviously  if singing is your job and your voice is suffering but you have a show the worst thing you can do is go out drinking alcohol which is terrible for your voice in the first place. He should have stayed in, drank tea, and gone to bed early.

" I've been following Bad Bunny since day 1, although I didn't like him that much at that time. I was more of an Ozuna fan. People were hyping this new album, because he was supposedly going back to his trap era, but I wasn't that excited for it. I think that Bad Bunny separated himself from the rest of Latin artists of his generation when he released his first album and left Hear This Music. Although he has done trap since that, it has not been the same as when he started, and that's great in my opinion, because he evolved for the better. And I find that people who wanted that Bad Bunny, are going to be disappointed with this new album. In my personal opinion, the intro to this album (Nadie Sabe) is one of the best songs of his career, and it took away the shine from all the other songs of the album, making it feel like the album was going downhill, although there we other really good songs still. Songs like: MR OCTOBER, CYBERTRUCK, VOU 787, are other highlights of the album, in my opinion. I'm speaking after my very first listen, so it can maybe grow or fall in my ranking, but I think this is better than his last album, although worse than EUTDM, X100pre, and YHLQMDLG.

"THIS is the drake I love, the drake I fell in love with. I don’t think it’s wrong for drake to revisit his roots while still incorporating a “newer” sound. I also think it’s weird to police what drake can rap about when he’s rapping about HIS life, wtf. Nobody ever has these same critiques for other artists. I never saw anyone say Beyoncé was “too old” to be singing “drop it like a thotty” and “paint the world pussy pink”. 

Realistically, Drake fans are the most fed fanbase, he is constantly releasing music and even if you absolutely hated EVERY SINGLE ALBUM, you would still have at least one banger on each on. 

At this point I believe people are just jumping on the bandwagon to hate on drake. There is no other artist that’s been able to maintain this type of relevancy and constantly be at the top of his craft like he has. And yal will not appreciate him until he’s gone. 

That being said I think FATD is one of his best albums of this era.

"Haven't heard this song since 2019, but yesterday I was in Hollister shopping and heard it playing on their speaker and oh man it really hit me on how good the song was. Couldn't stop listening to it on the way home from the mall and put it on repeat in the car. Such a soothing vibey song for anyone and I could see it definitely hitting home for those going through a recent breakup.

However, I felt Young Thugs part sort of ruined it. I remember thinking the same back when the song first came out too. I wouldn't necessarily say he ruined it, but his voice just did not compliment the style and vibe of the song. I think his part in the song was very unique of him to sing though compared to his own songs.

Overall, still a great song for sure. Especially Post Malone's part and even Young Thugs as well. Still listening to this song and added it to my playlist, glad I found the song again.

*Hey everyone, I hope you all had a great week. My week was good; we got some enjoyable songs that kept the days feeling good. One thing I did this week was pick out my summer anthem and album, which I'll share with you in the next couple of days. I'm excited to share that with you all since my summer anthem has been helping me a lot this summer. Let's jump into the music and see what the artists delivered this week.*

**Other Releases of the Week:**

*August 7th*

[**Deja Vu - Yena**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5IxNINeewg&pp=ygUMeWVuYSBkZWphIHZ1)

*Choi Yena is back with her first solo Japanese release. A piano opens the song with sweet vocals from Yena, but after that, it sounds like the production lacks something to make it stick with the listener. The hook is the weakest moment in the track, as it doesn't do much to pull me in. As a Jpop fan, it feels like I've heard this style but done better than what Yena delivers to the table. Yean does a little rap that doesn't need to be there since it doesn't add anything to the vibe of the producer's craft. I'm disappointed in what Yena delivered with her first solo Japanese release. '*

[**Somebody Like - Yoo Yeon Jung**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyMpMRU4XoE&pp=ygUYU29tZWJvZHkgLSBZb28gWWVvbiBKdW5n)

*Cosmic Girls member Yoo Yeon Jung is back with a new OST. A guitar opens up the smooth track as Yeon Jung delivers some sweet vocals that immediately pull me in. I love the melody and the catchy chorus that works well with the singer's performance. The instrumental might deliver nothing groundbreaking, but it does its job to make this an enjoyable OST for the singer. I listened to this tune several times this week, as I always love the solo OSTs that Yeon Jung releases.*

[**Alright (feat. pH-1, HAON & Jay Park) - Sik-k**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONZlJ4z044k&pp=ygUtQWxyaWdodCAoZmVhdC4gcEgtMSwgSEFPTiAmIEpheSBQYXJrKSAtIFNpay1r)

*My fifth favorite rapper has returned with a new studio album, and I've decided to talk about one song from the project. Alright, is the track I choose which features pH-1, Haon, and Jay Park. The instrumental goes for this funky hip-hop vibe that works well for Sik-K. Sik-K's autotune rapping/singing is enjoyable, helping to make this tune catchy. I love The 99 Problem, but a bitch ain't one line Jay-Z used in one of his songs. pH-1 delivers a killer feature that blends well with the bouncy instrumental. Haon teams up with Sik-k again this year, adding to the song by spitting some bars. I love Jay's smooth transition to the music, adding his vibe to the mix. The Sik-k project will have to grow on me the more I listen to it.*

*BTS member V released two songs from his album, dropping next month. The first new song is Rainy Days, opening up with Rainy Days and a phone text sound effect with a soft piano melody. V comes into the mix with his smooth vocals that blend well with this laidback tune. I like this tune's vibe; it gives me a coffee shop feel. I will mention this, but if you remove the vocals from V, I could see the instrumental fitting perfectly in those lofi study playlists or streams. Love Me Again is the second pre-release single V release, going for another coffee shop vibe. The jazzy piano melody helps move this tune forward as V sounds smooth with his vocal performance. This track gets repetitive, but the song is still enjoyable. While I find Rainy Days to be something I see myself listening to often, Love Me Again is still a beautiful tune. I'm excited to see what the rest of the V album will sound like*.

*Saxophone player Jason Lee is back teaming up with R&B singer meenoi for a new single called New York. A piano opens up the track with a jazzy feel as the saxophone comes into the mix. I love it when Jason Lee plays his saxophone cause he does a killer job blending well with different styles. I love the sound effects of New York that this tune delivers, which work well with the overall vibe. meenoi comes into the mix with some beautiful vocals that blend well with the instrumental. I love the moment the saxophone comes back, and meeoni sings with it. The piano melody closes the song perfectly, making me want to hear it again.*

*KHH producer Code Kunst is back teaming up with rapper Woo. A funky beat comes into the mix, with Woo delivering some excellent bars that work well with the instrumental. I'm not the biggest fan of Woo, but his performance on this track works well. I love the guitar and the drum machine that blend well together, crafting the overall vibe. The hook explodes with color as it adds to the general funky vibe Code Kunst crafts. I am returning to this tune since it's funky, so it might get stuck in my head.*

[**I Rise - Pentatonix**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStULxbd-BY&pp=ygUTSSBSaXNlIC0gUGVudGF0b25peA%3D%3D)

*Acapella group Pentatonix is back with a new original song, which I've been excited about since they announced. Stomping and breathing opens up the track as Scott starts off the tune. I love the backup vocals and the beatboxing, as it works well with the vibe. The chorus is fantastic, as it might be my favorite section of this song. The other members start clapping during the second verse, which works well with the vibe. Scott sings most of the track as the other members are used as backup vocals. Even if we don't hear the other members that much, I still love the overall sound this song delivers.*

Hello, redditors!  
Could you tell me which place will give you the best view for Ed's concert in Europe (Sofia, Bulgaria).  
I'm torn between the blue and green sectors, but I'm concerned about the positioning of Ed's mics, because when he sings on the two mics on the stage, one of the two sectors will look at his back. From  
videos in YouTube, I have come to a conclusion (but it's not final) that he will be ""face to face"" with the people in the green sector. The red sector is more expensive because it's under the roof.

Attached you can see the stage view and a snap from YouTube where the ""tongue/trail"" is behind him and in Sofia there is alos something like ""tongue/trail"", which is in front of the blue sector.

Not only does the song have a groove, but their two voices blend together so well. The drop beat at the start of the chorus, I really felt it in my bones. I loved Jimin's voice on it, delicate and recognizable as always but also with a lower register at the beginning of his verse and then Taeyang really has an easy voice to listen to with dynamism, his voice seems really versatile. The transitions between the two voices were so clean. Their vocals and high notes towards the end too were awesome. I liked that it was melodic.

Then also the fact that they were dancing, OMG as a fellow ARMY I can't get over Jimin dancing sharply. I liked Taeyang's dancing too, it's smooth too and it seems like the kind of song that suits him. Even if the MV is not extraordinary in itself (the setting), I liked the camera work, especially at *2:05* when we watch them dance, the camera goes from Taeyang to Jimin, then it comes back to Taeyang where in the meantime they are positioned so Taeyang is in the forefront but with his head a little off and Jimin just appears in the empty space, the camera follows them in mini rotation - anyway, you gotta see it to know it. I can definitely see this choreography being covered on tiktok.

However, the only negative side was that it was too short though but it really is a vibe and an easy to listen to song.

Taeyang also had the opportunity to [explain](https://www.nme.com/en_au/news/music/taeyang-single-vibe-featuring-jimin-music-video-interview-3380218) a little how the came to be collaboration, it was Teddy in the beginning who suggested Jimin two years ago, and after meeting BTS members one by one, he was able to met Jimin a year ago and offered him to do this collaboration.

So, your thoughts on this collaboration and song ?",https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/10anf5r/vibe_by_taeyang_and_jimin_just_came_out/,VIBE by Taeyang and Jimin just came out.,kpopthoughts,t3_10anf5r,/r/kpopthoughts/comments/10anf5r/vibe_by_taeyang_and_jimin_just_came_out/,2023-01-13 06:29:47,BTS,0.10739898

"Got VIP standing tickets in Bangkok last Thursday. I was so surprised that tickets were still available for the very next show in Singapore and I wanted to go!

Now I can’t help but keep trying to look for other locations in which tickets are still available and somehow figuring out flight tickets and if I can just fly there for the next concert. I’d love to fly to Tokyo next week or even Australia in November but my job isn’t allowing me to!!! Because 2 other people are already off and I might need to be called back just in case anyone else calls in sick. Argh, I’m so upset.

Their deep voices go so well together, they were LIVE. 

Jimin is so sweet, when he speaks I just get lovestruck and he such a sweet soul. He’s always hyping up everyone and I know yoongi always tells Jimin that he’s doing well but my god I love their bond. 

I have genuinely never seen someone as sweet as him. Just so precious.

"I am really appreciating V and his music nowadays . I was pretty lukewarm on Layover when it released , but it has grown tremendously on me. His voice is my favourite in BTS , and it has such a relaxing effect on me. His album flows extremely well as a whole and playing all of his solos while travelling from work to home while eyes closed really helps me mitigate my stress from the day.

I do still stand by the opinion that his previous solos were better, I love how he always painted vivid pictures around his favourite words( look up the lyrics of winter bear , snowflower or scenery) , but layover is so chill and easy to listen to. I know that it was his decision to release layover before he actually released his songs , and honestly it makes sense and I support his decision 

He is not my bias , but I am really liking to watch him nowadays in interviews and shows and stuff . He has a very calm vibe and has a sweetness in him. 

I look forward for more work from him in the future.",https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/16zjm88/layover_has_grown_on_me_so_much_so_an/,Layover has grown on me so much.

"Hi there - an older (and late to the game!) fan of Harry's, and just wanted to start a thread of all the things Harry's music (or example) has helped us with/go through, etc.  


A quick example - my husband is kind and lovely, but his job is one of those emotionally difficult ones, where at the end of the day, he has seen the worst side of people and is just sort of burned out on people sometimes. But, he's kind and spoils me, as we went to the Paris concert together even though he was on the fence about Harry's music.  


This weekend when we were out and about, he slid on the shirt I bought him for the concert ""Who is Harry and Why Are We Going to His House?

Nope - he said that Harry's concert/seeing him perform helped him remember to treat people with kindness, and just not take life so seriously sometimes.

"***Preface*** - Thought I needed a short preface for why I suddenly decided to write this long essay on an album that was released 3 years ago. This happened because I got a video on my Youtube recommendations, a fan-made video from Sept 2020 titled ['BTS making their new album'](https://youtu.be/2s-Ui8vICtY?si=Bf2VZk_BOfFvCGSJ). Watching it, I was shocked at how this video, released 2 months before the actual album, *so accurately* summarised the album and its contents. I was surprised by how much of the album had already been revealed several months in advance. This started my deep-dive back to BE era, resulting in me walking away with a new found appreciation for how unique this entire era was - from the album-making process to what the entire era encapsulated, and finally on how ambitious it all had been. This is a long post, so a big thank you to anyone who reads the entire thing.

## BE - The album

Let me start with a short introduction to the album. BE is BTS' 9th studio album, released on November 20th, 2020. It was their first and only album which was unplanned (not part of a normal release cycle) and was released in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was also an album where the members were actively involved in the production process, from concept and theme development, to songwriting and music video direction. With this album, the group and the company, as part of their attempt at staying connected in the midst of a raging pandemic, also decided to be more transparent with the whole process, uploading multiple videos of meetings held and doing youtube lives where they updated fans on how the album was coming along. The album contains 8 tracks (7 songs and 1 skit) with [""Life goes on""](https://youtu.be/-5q5mZbe3V8?si=oya1U-it51ajdC6R) as the title track. Out of these, 4 tracks were ones based on original compositions from the members and except for the skit and [Dynamite](https://youtu.be/J8fQMq4T8Yg?si=Clc6BiYioW0HzYWP), all seven members were also involved in writing lyrics for atleast one of the songs. The tracklist is as below (with the primary member involved highlighted):

- Life goes on
- [Fly to my room](https://youtu.be/jrKXI_OBgYY?si=GITrYaPKILH3wE1p) (unit song - V, Jimin, Suga, J-hope)
- [Blue and grey](https://youtu.be/qmMspfkCnuc?si=qI1QF10I4o5jiWoB) (V)
- [Skit]( https://youtu.be/_Z99SGoxRkk?si=pvuPu-aDo6tiGWpX) (of them the day following their Hot 100 No.1 announcement)
- [Telepathy](https://youtu.be/6Lu2q37k7kI?si=3IHywf5GiJDO01d8) (Suga)
- [Dis-ease](https://youtu.be/wUig7BD1kag?si=g3AQWIlA8r2yECWd) (J-hope)
- [Stay](https://youtu.be/GbeGE38H0XE?si=_kUq0W2kY9dHw0Ko) (Jungkook) (unit song - Jungkook, Jin, RM)
- [Dynamite](https://youtu.be/c4V0FNZfEv0?si=CTcxMvSNS0iJ3VJj)

Borrowing from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be_(BTS_album)),

>”Be” is primarily a pop record, encompassing hip hop, EDM, and disco genres with elements of synth-pop, funk, and R&B. Described by BTS as ""a letter of hope"", the lyrics are about comfort, loneliness, anxiety, sadness, hope, connection, and joy

Sonically, the album starts out with more subdued melodies and songs with slower bpm, with the skit providing a short interlude, then picking up pace and energy in the second half of the album with [Dynamite](https://youtu.be/PCZYPgprwFk?si=FMOABCZSf99PMf36) as the final track, sort of a celebratory hurrah after ""Stay"", a song that reaffirms their comfort in knowing they have fans who will always stay, and to whom they feel a connection with even being so far apart physically.

## BE - The era

So this is actually the most important part of the post for me because, what is so unique about the BE era, is that **it did not start when the date of the album release was first announced, nor did it end after the first few weeks of promotion**. To help expand my point, let us go back to [February 28th 2020](https://twitter.com/bts_bighit/status/1233195543842549760?t=eLs_pc9p5m_7p_eb0oMyEg&s=19), when, as the world slowly started to realise the seriousness of the COVID-19 flu, Bighit announced that the Seoul concerts set to kick off BTS' *""Map of the Soul""* tour had been cancelled. Over the next few weeks, announcements would continue coming in, of the postponement of tour dates at more and more regions till eventually, by late March 2020, all tour dates had been indefinitely postponed. The future seemed more uncertain than ever and BTS and ARMY, along with the rest of the world, were stuck in limbo with no set plan or direction. Then, on **17th April 2020**, a few weeks after the tour postponements, RM [came live on youtube](https://youtu.be/-uUB9fpiTN4?si=H0HGuvq8G51Tjsyi) to announce that **they would be releasing a new album**, and that no details had been worked out yet, but they would try to share as much of the album-making process as possible. He talked about wanting to share some aspects of their daily lives and work as they found themselves forced into isolation by the pandemic, and in that way, hopefully providing some form of comfort for people and in turn, themselves. The live was tagged with the hashtags \#StayConnected and \#CarryOn. This *officially kickstarted* the BE era and also set the theme for the entire era - ***trying to remain connected while working through feelings of isolation, helplessness and fear; trying to find joy in the little moments in life; being more honest and transparent with self and others and doing the best you can in situations where there is little that can be done***. The biggest goal - **offering comfort**. In whatever way they could, the members of BTS wanted to alleviate people's suffering atleast at a miniscule level, or make them smile even for just a moment.

Over the next few months, they would set out to do exactly that. While continuing to give updates about their album prep (more on this later), they started doing lives where they would share new hobbies like [painting](https://www.youtube.com/live/hiLg74p4i8M?si=knqI-VC3puEVFIMy) or [playing the keyboard](https://www.youtube.com/live/6g6gPmE-gcg?si=qetoESz1FApd_D0v). Other times, J-hope let the viewers watch as he [worked on his freestyle and warm-up](https://www.youtube.com/live/Thd1z7iN4QA?si=MhGBejoeYAu42eNp) or [song production](https://www.youtube.com/live/tSvIsJtHAng?si=BwneMZf-uU1UMCbA), while sometimes they popped in just to [hang out listening to music](https://www.youtube.com/live/z0BqjWi0qeU?si=z3R0op6rCm7vMdHu) or just for a [quick chat](https://www.youtube.com/live/U5w6hZtsBt0?si=tPUpBDpTXiRN38xh). Jimin often came to [give updates](https://www.youtube.com/live/DYaj3NLIOQU?si=Ado6kqwl-hWCLr3a) about the album. On VLIVE, they would come in singles, pairs or trios to do hour long activities ranging from [making dalgona coffee, arts and craft, Just Dance, cooking to making bracelets](https://youtu.be/bquWFIL8Mug?si=uPC0bLKZxSwc_MfL). Suga started a radio series where he would host one member each week, where they read *(voice-acted to their hearts' content would be more apt)* [old folktales](https://youtu.be/KeHctqB8UE4?si=NWdq1WtpBbhQzHp5) and did fun activities, ending with him reading out listeners' messages and offering small pieces of advice. The series ended with a grand finale on the date of their 7th anniversary (13th June 2020), when the seven members all came together to read [""The Wizard of Oz""](https://youtu.be/7_e6j_mPQio?si=MRG3IV7ILRojrLLj). During this period, BTS did a total of ***39 VLIVEs and 25 Youtube lives***, more than any other year (one could argue they had more time, which is true to an extent, but they also worked a lot during this period, which I shall elaborate on later).

Knowing how disappointed fans were by the tour cancellation, Bighit hosted the first [BANGBANGCON](https://atwoodmagazine.com/bbcb-bts-bang-bang-con-livestream-review/?expand_article=1) lasting two days during a weekend in April 2020, where old concerts and shows *(a total of 8)* were livestreamed for free on Youtube and Weverse. These had an accumulated 50 million views and a peak of 2.2 million concurrent viewers at one point, with fans from all over the world tuning in for a happy shared experience as a community, the concerts being a first-time watch for many. Two months later, during their anniversary celebrations, the group would host ""Bangbangcon: The Live"", their *first ever online concert*. They also performed for the [""Dear Class of 2020""](https://youtu.be/ErTgtL1Tjns?si=a0ETRDTre5pwVEO3) youtube series, prepared for the graduating students of the class of 2020 who had been unable to attend a live graduation. Their [speech for the occasion](https://youtu.be/AU6uF5sFtwA?si=2AywEbpgKocpruc4) is one of my favorites to this day, offering warm words of comfort and encouragement to not just the graduating class, but anyone who listened or was going through a difficult time. Unable to go on their usual ""Bon Voyage"", the show where they travelled as a group to different countries, they instead filmed [In the Soop](https://youtu.be/lyk0Sc4o2t8?si=yDynXY5blke8uSiH), a healing show where they spent time together at a peaceful retreat near the forest.

Continuing their commitment to remain connected, they sent [handwritten postcards](https://twitter.com/bts_bighit/status/1321104459867385856?t=rzrfp73qEZtJGDKOFopaHQ&s=19) to ARMY and asked for letters in return, [some of which they read out loud](https://youtu.be/_sxUG8O6M2w?si=c79lJvcioj8mlKQ2&t=18m22s) in a video just before the album release. The big culmination of their efforts to offer some brightness to the world, was [Dynamite](https://youtu.be/ikgefER2O08?si=wa7QdLBoHqHxO-au), their first all-English song which, to their surprise, was so much of a success that it gave them their first Billboard Hot 100 no. 1 and catapulted them to even greater heights. Overall, BE era felt less like an album era and more like a journey and fight that BTS and ARMY put up to find some healing and comfort in very difficult times. The era also continued well into 2021, with the last few months of 2020 being another difficult time for the group as *Suga had an operation done for his left shoulder injury, leaving the group as six through a season of award shows and performances*. In my opinion, it may have drawn to a close with the release of the [Be-hind interview series](https://www.youtube.com/live/cNomzAh3-tY?si=9DoFy2j_pH7sy9nh) where the members took turns interviewing each other one-on-one on their musical journeys, and Suga rejoined the group as they prepared to release Butter.

## BE - Making the album

Like I mentioned before, the preparations for BE album were vastly different from previous ones. A decision was made for the members to be actively involved, from the album theme to the visuals to the music video and even the album art. Another decision was to be as transparent as possible whilst making the album, offering fans a look into the process as much as possible *while avoiding straight-up spoilers*. Thus, members were given the roles of [""Project Manager""](https://twitter.com/strrynghtskyys/status/1330306462405566477?t=XaBPLOj_PjJNzmDLsUOqJA&s=19) within the group, coordinating with the company on various details of the album: Jimin as [Music PM](https://www.youtube.com/live/iJWzkOH8glo?si=Se_yh5bRsqz_pN8N), V as [Visual PM](https://www.youtube.com/live/_N9SBkvY-tw?si=3yq08rJfaN9be3gD), Jungkook as MV Director and the other members chiming in with ideas for the concept and styling, as well as album design. V also took charge of planning the entire schedule for [their album photoshoot](https://youtu.be/dnnxNw2ZZ5o?si=DyfgKQvRaa2OCbtZ&t=3m56s) They would regularly upload videos of their meetings [discussing concepts](https://www.youtube.com/live/_N9SBkvY-tw?si=1P1-pC8cssUsTgMM), learning [camera work](https://www.youtube.com/live/T5GoQ5DYNy8?si=dWOopAYE5LNqYutz), and meetings with the company staff on the [music video for the title track](https://www.youtube.com/live/gyqx8i40dkU?si=5RAYLubWeiLlQ2Wg). We saw them [working on the lyric book](https://www.youtube.com/live/CRxXTqp5tTM?si=Wg0cM7gaArxKWCjf) and [recording the songs](https://www.youtube.com/live/dlKk5Fx9czQ?si=P9sO4qtb4IDRHNrG). The album design itself seemed about done by [September 2020](https://www.youtube.com/live/bxd4M4UiUmE?si=ot35aPoZRTdpupGI). All these were released way before the album, and most of the ideas made it into the actual album itself. Going back and watching these actually gave me a lot of pleasant surprises seeing how transparent it had all been.

### Theme and song selection

A [recording of a meeting](https://www.youtube.com/live/D7HPWv4apDA?si=9tX4ETDGPc_j_MuC) between the seven members of BTS held some time in April was uploaded on 11th May 2020. The agenda for this - *discussing the theme of the album, what messages to convey, and how many songs to include*. The entire era and album was thus based on this one meeting, and it surprised me how true they stayed to most of the things decided. For example, they decided on a total of 7 tracks (4 group songs, 2 unit songs and 1 skit) with the unit having 4 and 3 members each. [Dynamite](https://youtu.be/y5g-PTeDkwY?si=vMlvKR6B2N2yiB_W) was an addition to this plan later on after its massive success. They brought up the keywords *""Life goes on""* and *""Telepathy""*, which both ended up being actual song titles. They had collectively agreed on trying to bring comfort through this album, but one thing that sticks out to me is Jimin's words about this, which was

>But we should be careful. Even something intended to be consoling can make someone feel even worse

which comes across to me as so emotionally sensitive and empathetic. I personally feel like they did a great job with doing exactly that. I love V's words in his Weverse interview about his track ""Blue & Grey""

>Rather than just some stranger telling them to cheer up, I think it's better to say something like, ""You seem depressed lately"", or ""Seems like these days it's tough for you to perk up"". ""Blue&Grey"" is the same: ""You're depressed lately? Me too. We're in the same boat. Wanna talk about how you're feeling? You wanna feel better, right? I know, but sometimes it feels like you're being washed away by a whirlpool of stress"". I want the listeners to hear me saying that to them.

In their later meetings, they also decided on the concept of [""Room""](https://youtu.be/LfPLS5Sndq4?si=ndUJeNwgBu7nGPzp), as a big part of quarantine life was being stuck in your own room feeling suffocated and longing for the outside, having little to do. Particular to them as artists, they also wanted to portray missing performances in front of live audiences. As most of their themes were about being their natural selves, they also wanted to include atleast one [conceptual shoot with a more uniform look](https://youtu.be/dnnxNw2ZZ5o?si=pPI-oAsIz-bV2OwZ&t=4m36s) that they thought fans might appreciate. All these ideas came to fruition in their [concept art](https://ibighit.com/bts/kor/discography/detail/be.html) and ""Life goes on"" music video.

As for the song selection process, as is Bighit's style, it was again akin to a big *song camp*, with the members submitting their songs and melodies to Jimin, who organised them and presented them to the company. Both the members and in-house producers were part of this song camp. But this time around, the members mentioned how more of their ideas were entertained, how excited they all were, how competitive they got about composing for the title track especially, and how more songs made by the members themselves made it in. Their unit songs especially were interesting as they didn't decide on who would be in which unit, but rather, after listening to each track, each member decided which one they wanted to be in. J-hope did recall some clashes here and there but stated they've always been good at communication, hence everything went smoothly. They also worked closely together on each song, with RM taking part in lyrics for every song except Dynamite, and J-hope mentioning [Jimin and RM especially](https://youtu.be/RIJ33f6khDI?si=RRE7JZWSKM208kZf&t=14m16s) for their help in completing Dis-ease, and V thanking Suga for [his lyrics on Blue&Grey](https://youtu.be/4T6oiXKDPyI?si=BDis8KQgJyGxJIJX&t=8m40s). The members have talked about how this was the most fun they've had making an album, and how it cemented their teamwork even better, also reviving their love for songwriting and composing. They also did not claim full involvement in the album production, talking about how **none of their own compositions** made it to the final version of ""Life goes on"" (it was their longtime producer, Pdogg who won finally), and RM mentions having to [compromise with the company](https://youtu.be/1mkhdpbe4R0?si=ia54ACZf4QhkLqy3&t=17m46s) between *having a track that was radio-friendly and what they themselves wanted which was something warm and comforting to listen to*. Suga's rejected submission for the title track would eventually [make it into his own album D-day](https://youtu.be/mzWnW1V9EMc?si=fCWLZahwD1R0s6La) three years later. Overall, they were very candid about the whole process and this album provided great insight into how album production and song selection usually happens for BTS.

## BTS in 2020

So I needed to add this part because I find it so fascinating and admirable how BTS did everything they did while making BE, while still connecting to fans regularly, and still worked a ton on other things, none of which were easy. I still can't believe they wrote Dis-ease (a song about feeling restless while not working), when they did all this. I've just grouped them into two big chunks to not make this too lengthy:

***Music releases*** 

- [D-2](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lV1BhQbKMjudkNoNKYokycJgbbWDdt7ZM&si=dmzEPvfmtw9aPWmu] (Suga's second mixtape)
- MOTS: The Journey (Japanese album containing two new original songs [""Stay gold""](https://youtu.be/9IHwqdz8Xhw?si=iIEAPwea8CMrDnDq) and [""Your eyes tell""](https://youtu.be/KVAt8jwUobI?si=_rpkqbsPlMuIKy58))
- [Still with you](https://youtu.be/BksBNbTIoPE?si=j6wNGI3GLA_HqsWI)

- [Blueberry eyes](https://youtu.be/TzFRVk2ektI?si=ysgNWt5KNihAUv-I) by MAX (ft. Suga)

- [Dynamite](https://youtu.be/jWRMXiHhDjc?si=1ifadZ1xB-zFai7w)
- [IONIQ](https://youtu.be/l6yzZdHruUI?si=2mdnCJ9Y3imNEfPW) (how is this for an ad?)

Most of these came with their own set of promotions and filming as well, so they weren't just a one-off and then done thing *(just for funsies, every time I've mentioned Dynamite, I've linked a different favorite performance of mine, just to show how many performances of this they've done)*.

***Performances and shows*** 

- BANGBANGCON: The live *(1st online concert)*
- Run BTS *(their in-house variety show which cheerfully continued all through the year)*
- In The Soop
- MOTS ON:E *(2nd online concert)*
- a [whole](https://youtu.be/oYpUZjxJOVg?si=UVMb4FA2P51T6acw) [Jimmy](https://youtu.be/2rcKpY-4QBI?si=9w8aAZ6Zo7z03hBd) [Fallon](https://youtu.be/g1-sFn-j5D0?si=_6OzxNpPOc6WOYRQ) [week](https://youtu.be/MXFkjMNXfpY?si=2yiksVU9-YVCU3N4)
- Dear Class of 2020
- [Festa](https://youtu.be/t9zPnWQIiuw?si=rpPrNyEn1QOZVhvz) with all its [celebrations](https://youtu.be/kBVQ1s_REzI?si=IPItsoio-9UpedYu)
- [Tiny Desk](https://youtu.be/gFYAXsa7pe8?si=_WJ2VnsTuQi-PyFl)
- their *second speech* at the [UN General Assembly](https://youtu.be/5aPe9Uy10n4?si=1bdksy4GZcracYHr)
- and all their performances at award shows including [BBMAs](https://youtu.be/F43Rj9c1TQs?si=B-LTjISmJ51eG-wd), [AMAs](https://youtu.be/iK86ae14jV4?si=VX3FjZHMkneQYOnG), [VMAs](https://youtu.be/2DKJO8YBWas?si=aMBx_JIZDGgmFsUU), [MAMA](https://youtu.be/5XjSuldr_i8?si=vC8gHMWaC6rd3EEX), [MMA](https://youtu.be/PtaP4UkZKyc?si=a1oaP2dRkhruaIyg), [AGT](https://youtu.be/raAt5oFQqqc?si=Sq1Ay4-KbD3iJI7Q), [GMA](https://youtu.be/owGeoIF0zOs?si=Ypi5iEFUIQ5RbpF3), [James Corden show](https://youtu.be/IDIiFj_q1Sc?si=77L3kCat0hjbQwMJ). 

Whew! These were the major ones I could think of. I think I missed a few Korean award shows and some other music shows. But yeah..they were ***performing*** that entire year. In addition, both the **""Break The Silence""** docu-series and movie were released as well. I wouldn't even mention their [Season's greetings shoot](https://youtu.be/yjetoy-RKQ8?si=Y6tLVFZEYvGzRTUR) if it wasn't one of the best things they've ever done.

So, yeah, all this in addition to BE and all its promotions and shoots. All I can say is, I truly agree with V when he recently said on [Suchwita](https://youtu.be/M6wpkLCiHoI?si=GS0lPC_nHrNoCuvp&t=32m42s) (Suga's talk show) that for the past 10 years, BTS has worked harder than anybody.

### So why do I think of BE as their most ambitious album yet?

First, I really do have to commend Bighit. At the point of BE's release, BTS was already the biggest group in the world, with many fans and non-fans having their eyes on them, making sure to check out their new releases. With that, I definitely think it was a brave move letting the members have free rein on the entire production process, right down to the little things (we can also clearly see how this wasn't just for show, but actually reflected in how the album turnt out). The company, while ready to provide a helping hand and coordinate with the members, and probably having the final say on many things, did let the members decide most of what went into this, *without any guarantee that it would work, or that a quality album would be made*. If you look at the entire promotion and rollout, including concept introduction, album packaging (for example, *having just one expensive deluxe edition at the time with all photocards in one album*), and development, it was completely different from their other releases. *Profits were not guaranteed either, as before this, they had been releasing atleast 4 versions for a while*. Thinking from a business perspective, one version probably wouldn't break their previous sales record either, which we know is a big talking point for companies in the media. This really was BTS' brain child album that they mostly thought up themselves. But the company allowed it and went ahead with a very unconventional release. I give them a lot of props for that.

Secondly, the members. Again, they took on a lot of responsibility for this album, besides **so many other things** they had on their plate. They clearly know how any mistake would reflect on the team and the company, but they truly stepped up to do their best. That must have taken so much courage, and so much hard work to make sure they delivered. So, I find their courage truly admirable. And then talking about the actual quality of the album...BE is an **excellent** album (I do know taste is subjective, but I think a lot of people agree with me). ***Thematically cohesive, sonically diverse and rich, emotionally moving and visually appealing.*** I think they did a great job, and it really shows how talented the members are musically, creatively and how well they work together. If you watch any of their uploaded meetings that I've linked, you can see how open they are to each other's ideas, while freely discussing the pros and cons of each, how they don't mind shooting down ideas they don't think might work, and **how great RM is as a leader** as he often summarises their discussions into more compact points. I think they also really enjoyed this type of album creation and found it an important stepping stone for them as a group. My favorite video from this era is when, after the album's release, the members [did a be-hind video looking back on the album making process](https://youtu.be/cYX88pxQuCo?si=023trDYQbuZwT-wL). And I love Jimin's quote on the advantage of working together with the members. When asked how, as the Music PM, he prods along the members who take too long to submit ideas, he replied

>I would mention them by name in our group chat, and that got them to reply. (laughs) Any time I said someone or other didn't submit their idea yet, all the others would chime in with,  ""Hurry up, guys!"" and then they'd give it to me

I think Bighit's A&R team would love having Jimin as a permanent member lol. So now you see why I find BE so ambitious and daring.

## Conclusion: *Thank You BTS*

If you are a BTS fan, you've probably seen all the interviews and videos BTS have filmed since the release of BE, where they mention how *2020 was the hardest year for them*. They struggled both personally and as a group, with feelings of uncertainty, loneliness, insecurity and missing a part of their job that they love the most (performing in front of fans). They had been planning **the biggest tour of their lives**, which got cancelled and they had to keep watching their plans be cancelled again and again. As they mentioned during Festa 2022, we also know that the pandemic *messed up a lot of their career plan as individuals and as a group*. We can see bits of their struggle in their solo albums and songs. Yet in spite of all this, they kept up a brave front for us and only sought to comfort people and help alleviate their pain in some way. **All through that year**, they were a big support system for thousands of people around the world - through all their lives and activities, speeches, performances and finally by releasing ""BE"", *the perfect pandemic-themed album*. I'm so grateful to them and I'm so happy that even though they didn't mean for it to, they got rewarded with Dynamite's success propelling them even higher and even a **Grammy nomination**. I will always be grateful to have discovered these seven lovely men, and so proud to be a fan always. Thank you so much BTS, for being you, and for BE. It ***forever*** remains one of my favorite albums.

"I joined this group cause I love Drake, I think everything he puts out is a 10/10. I genuinely love him as a person. I’ve traveled as far as Toronto just to see him preform in his home city (I live in Australia) and I have several tattoos referencing him… I’m kind of sad that everyone on here just talks shit about him. So my question being, how come so many people hate him on his fan page? Or is this a joke page?

Edit: yes people’s initial posts may not be negative but just click on any post and you’ll find it filled with negative comments. I know the internet is always going to criticize and everyone is entitled to their own opinion but it’s LITERALLY a Drake FAN forum.😅",https://www.reddit.com/r/Drizzy/comments/17k9wju/does_everyone_on_here_actually_hate_drake/,Does everyone on here actually hate Drake?,Drizzy,t3_17k9wju,/r/Drizzy/comments/17k9wju/does_everyone_on_here_actually_hate_drake/,2023-10-31 01:47:57,Drake,0.37073207

"Realistic Prediction Timeline of PM6

First Single: Mar/Apr 2024
Second Single: Sep/Oct 2024
Third Single: Dec/Jan 2024
Album Release: February 2025

I pose this discussion because I like to look at trends in artists music. And Post Malone’s trend was very consistent until COVID. We see an early single, a second promotional single, and a third and final single close to release of album. 

And given the time frames between albums I believe this one lines up well. 

Debut Single For Each Album
White Iverson: 16 months before Stoney
Candy Paint: 12 months before b&B
Wow: 9 months before HB
One Right Now: 7 months before TCT
Chemical: 3 months before AUSTIN

So an average of 9.4 months between first single and release date. 

Expect PM6 early 2025 and the first single 
early-ish 2024 if the world doesn’t shutdown again :)

"Even wonder went a K-pop Group will perform at the Halftime Show, and who will it be and went. BTS and TWICE are both one of popular groups in the world with both selling out Stadium in US. 

It be cool, if these two collaborators, I believed they could collaborate by perform the Super Bowl Halftime.

I highly doubt that two will happen performing at the Super Bowl, they both have good fanbases. 

What good things that can come out is that they both put on a good show performance some of their songs. 

BTS: Dynamite and Butter 

TWICE: Fancy and Feel Special 

What bad things is the language ge barrier, people not knowing who they are, and worried that show could collapse. 

What your though on BTS and TWICE collaboration for the Super Bowl Halftime? 

With BTS members still being in the Military, it likely be once the group reunion.

"I've always liked Post Malone's mainstream songs but these last few months been listening to a lot of his other stuff which is his best IMO. Recently went to a music festival for the first time (37M) and decided I want to experience more live music. Been contemplating buying tickets to one of his concerts and one night decided to bite the bullet and spent $1500 on 2 tickets in the pit. I've NEVER spent that much on a lot let alone concert tickets. For anyone who has been to his concerts what can I expect? I've heard mixed reviews. I told my wife I only bought lawn seats so she's in for a treat when she realizes we are going into the pit. Also...what is the pit like? Is it crowded, does it vary on location? I'll be in Tampa. My wife likes his music but not to the same extent as me.

"I really love festivals and it's so great as non-fans get a chance to see other artists from different industries. Blackpink did such a wonderful job and they totally killed it. 

BTS never did any US festivals as far as I remember right now but I'd really love them to headline one. Like just imagine how spectacular that would be and they'll get a chance to show GP the songs apart from Dynamite or Butter that they are mostly known for now. They could have a 2 hours set and can include their solo songs as well. BTS are such a phenomenal performers so i know people will love it. 

What do you think? Is there any chance that will make their comeback in Coachella in 2026? Or just  perhaps do a festival??

"MEGA SPOILERS!

Here is the list of songs on the album in the order he played them with a summary of how I feel about it at the end. PLEASE DO NOT READ IF YOU WANT TO EXPERIENCE THE ALBUM ORGANICALLY. However, I have been asked by a few people to make this post. :)



Boat- beautiful song, very emotional, probably my favourite from the album. “The waves won’t break my boat” is the sort of descent of the chorus. Really impactful. A song basically relating staying afloat on the water and struggles in life.



Salt water - unsure, (if anyone can help) although I remember hearing the words “kiss me, salt water”



Eyes closed - a song about losing someone and thinking that you’re going to see them or “bump into them” but you won’t anymore. 



Life goes on - Ed felt that after his friend Jamal passed away, he wanted everything to stop as it did when the queen passed away. However, everyone has to get on with their life and that’s what he felt he had to do, hence, “life goes on”.



Dusty - a more joyous and upbeat song from the album. It is a song about his two daughters and no matter how upset he is, he will wake up and they will always bring him joy. The name dusty is in reference to “dusty in Memphis” an album which I believe is the vinyl that she chose to play with Ed leading to him writing this song.



End of youth - Ed reflected back on his time at school and how there are people at a very young age that lose someone they love and how this essentially cuts their youth short. This is an emotional song about losing someone you love as a child and how painful this would be as it would essentially be the “end of youth”.



Curtain - a song about how no matter how dark life gets, there will always be someone to pull back the curtain and let the sun shine through. Ed went on to say how he was so lucky to have great people surrounding him, (friends, wife, parents, etc)



Colourblind - this song was about something along the lines of life and how it can be all different colours with ups and downs but when you’re in love you become colourblind. Essentially, it’s about how love can help you deal with all of life’s troubles.



Borderline - unsure, (if anyone can help)



Spark - a song about wanting to get rid of all of the bad things from a relationship and replace them with the original good things about the relationship that gave them the initial “spark”. The main lyrics are something along the lines of “let’s burn it all on a fire until we’re left with the spark” (something like that).



Vega - this track is about the time in his life where his pregnant wife had fallen ill and the track is him venting his imminent feelings about this after hearing the news. Vega is in reference to the brightest star in the northern constellation of Lyra. The main lyrics are “it burns like hell to be Lyra”. He claimed that he wrote this song in a very short amount of time and wasn’t even sure what some of the lyrics even meant but they fit what he wanted perfectly.



Sycamore - unsure, (if anyone can help)



No strings - Ed claimed this this was one of his favourite songs he has ever written it is a love song about his wife.



The hills of aberfeldy - a beautiful song he wrote ten years ago, about falling in love on the hills of aberfeldy. He claimed that this song was always meant to end his version of subtract and felt that it does it perfectly. It is a feel good song and a lovely way to end the mathematics masterpieces, (disregarding subtract deluxe)



Overall, the album is an ensemble of beautiful songs about common tragedies and how these situations made Ed feel. You can really sense his vulnerability and how he used these songs as a shield to fend off all the pain and sadness that he was feeling during these times. 



A picturesque description of how poorly life can treat people and the emotions are painted vividly between each lyric. An impactful album that will leave you sad, reflective and overwhelmed and all you can say is “Ed Sheeran has done it again”. What a way to end my favourite series of albums that have seen me grow up from a young age



Also, if anyone can add anything to these or correct me if I’m wrong on anything then please do, there was so much to take in and I know I have missed out so many great points. :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/EdSheeran/comments/124ig7f/mega_album_spoilers/,MEGA ALBUM SPOILERS!,EdSheeran,t3_124ig7f,/r/EdSheeran/comments/124ig7f/mega_album_spoilers/,2023-03-28 08:53:16,Ed Sheeran,0.115658075
