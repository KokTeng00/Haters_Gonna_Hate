"On November 11, 2008, Taylor Swift released her second album Fearless. Swift began writing the album while touring for her 2006 self titled debut album. Fearless’s would help launch Swift to superstardom outside of the country music scene. 

5 singles were released from the album. [Love Story](https://youtu.be/8xg3vE8Ie_E?si=Uk4Wd0wF9bghn5ep) was the first single released from the album and would peak at #4 on the Hot 100 and #1 on Billboard’s Hot Country Songs chart. [White Horse](https://youtu.be/D1Xr-JFLxik?si=42Ijz2oUoraXKRx-) was the second single and peaked at #13 on the Hot 100. The third single [You Belong with Me](https://youtu.be/VuNIsY6JdUw?si=tC54FXXu8Gl94NST) would become the most successful single from the album, peaking at #2 on the Hot 100 and would become Swift’s highest charting single on the Hot 100 at the time and  #1 on the Hot Country Songs chart. The fourth single [Fifteen](https://youtu.be/Pb-K2tXWK4w?si=9G3iSPz6iH6DMjr-) would peak at #23. The [title track](https://youtu.be/ptSjNWnzpjg?si=RETTBA_L7gRoBVAG) would become the fifth and final single from the album and peaked at #9. 

Fearless would become a massive success. The album peaked at #1 on the Billboard 200 chart. In 2017, it was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album would become the most awarded Country album of all time winning Album of the Year at the Country Music Association Awards (CMAs), the Academy of Country Music Awards (ACM Awards) and the Grammy Awards. 

Following the dispute over the ownership of her masters, Swift would release a re-recorded version of the album titled Fearless (Taylor’s Version), which would become the first of her re recorded albums in 2021.

"I'm sure as most of you have seen, If This Was A Movie (TV) is now considered part of Fearless (TV) and The Hunger Games songs are considered part of Red (TV) after the releases from last night.

Thinking of these songs within the tracklist as a whole, where would you put them in the tracklist?

For me:

* If This Was A Movie would be put in between Today Was A Fairytale and You All Over Me on Fearless (TV) 
* Then, it would be State Of Grace (Acoustic), Eyes Open, Safe &amp; Sound for Red (TV)
* And All Of The Girls (is harder to place) but I guess between Death By A Thousand Cuts and London Boy",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/11ttm4s/tracklist_game_for_the_new_released_songs/,Tracklist Game For The New Released Songs,TaylorSwift,t3_11ttm4s,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/11ttm4s/tracklist_game_for_the_new_released_songs/,2023-03-17 15:02:04,Taylor Swift,0.20839658

"*1989* changed Taylor's career forever. If *Red* had just sprinkles of pop sounds, *1989* was marketed as a pure pop album from the get-go.

While many fans and critics kind of expected that, it seems like:

1. Taylor didn't have a clear direction from the start (except for the cohesiveness): “I wanted it to be a sonically cohesive album, and it ended up really being the first I’ve done since *Fearless*. I also wanted the songs to sound exactly how the emotions felt. I know that’s pretty vague, so I really didn’t know where it was going to go, but I knew that I wanted to work with the collaborators I had such crazy electricity with on *Red*, like Max Martin. I wanted to do some things that sounded nothing like what we had done before.”
2. She knew that she didn't want another Red: “When people say that they like one of my albums, like when people told me that RED was their favorite album I'd done, I didn't take that as, 'So, I should make that again'. I took that as, 'Great, awesome, now I wanna make them like this new album just as much if not more than the last album.' But I want them to like it for different reasons.”
3. She was worried about the change of direction of her music: “I worry about everything. Some days I wake up in a mindset of, like, ‘Okay, it’s been a good run.’ By afternoon, I could have a change of mood and feel like anything is possible and I can’t wait to make this kind of music I’ve never made before. And then by evening, I could be terrified of the whole thing again. And then at night, I’ll write a song before bed.”

**October 17, 2012:** \[From a Lover Journal\] Taylor writes *This Love* in LA. This will be the last song produced by Nathan Chapman and the only one recorded in Nashville.

* “The last time I wrote a poem that ended up being a song, I was writing in my journal and I was writing about something that had happened in my life – it was about a year ago – and I just wrote this really really short poem. It said, 'This love is good /this love is bad / this love is alive back from the dead / these hands had to let it go free / and this love came back to me.' And I just wrote it down, closed the book and put it back on my nightstand \[…\] All of a sudden in my head I just started hearing this melody happen, and then I realized that it was going to be a song.”
* Handwritten lyrics:

**November 18, 2012:** Taylor meets Jack Antonoff and his band, fun., for the first time in Frankfurt, Germany, while at the MTV Europe Music Awards. They bond over 80s music.

**January 4, 2013:** Taylor is [seen in a boat](https://href.li/?https://www.eonline.com/news/376598/taylor-swift-spotted-on-boat-without-harry-styles-amid-breakup-reports) without Harry Styles, ready to return to LA from the Virgin Islands.

She will wear the same dress in the *Out Of The Woods* music video (and also in *Look What You Made Me Do*)

**January 10, 2013:** Taylor tweets ""*Back in the studio. Uh oh..."".* She will confirm that the song was *All You Had To Do Was Stay* on October 27, 2014 on Tumblr.

* [Candids here](https://href.li/?https://taylorpictures.net/displayimage.php?album=2039&pid=119342#top_display_media);
* “There’s a song on my album called 'All You Had To Do Was Stay.' I was having this dream, that was actually one of those embarrassing dreams, where you’re mortified in the dream, you’re like humiliated. In the dream, my ex had come to the door to beg for me to talk to him or whatever, and I opened up the door and I went to go say, 'Hi,' or 'What are you doing here?' or something — something normal — but all that came out was this high-pitched singing that said, 'Stay!' It was almost operatic. So I wrote this song, and I used that sound in the song. Weird, right? I woke up from the dream, saying the weird part into my phone, figuring I had to include it in something because it was just too strange not to. In pop, it’s fun to play around with little weird noises like that.”

**January 11, 2013:** Taylor is [seen again at Conway Studios](https://href.li/?https://taylorpictures.net/displayimage.php?album=2043&pid=119397#top_display_media), likely to continue working on *All You Had To Do Was Stay*.

**January 15, 2013:** Taylor posts a picture of herself in the studio, with the caption ""Somewhere in LA"". She'll later reveal that she was writing *How You Get The Girl.*

* “The song ‘How You Get The Girl’ is a song that I wrote about how you get the girl back if you ruined the relationship somehow and she won’t talk to you anymore. Like, if you broke up with her and left her on her own for six months and then you realize you miss her. All the steps you have to do to edge your way back into her life, because she’s probably pretty mad at you. So it’s kind of a tutorial. If you follow the directions in the song, chances are things will work out. Or you may get a restraining order.”

**March 6, 2013:** Taylor is seen [going to a studio](https://href.li/?https://taylorpictures.net/displayimage.php?album=2102&pid=122066#top_display_media) in LA.

**March 23, 2013:** Taylor posts a picture of herself playing guitar, which might mean that she was working on a new song: *""Pre show. Columbia, South Carolina""*. This could be either *Wonderland, New Romantics* or a vault song.

**May 27, 2013:** While in Rhode Island for the Memorial Day weekend, Jack plays Taylor an instrumental track that will later become *I Wish You Would*.

* In 2014, Lena Dunham posted this photo of Jack and Taylor. She didn't say they were recording I Wish You Would but Jack's studio is credited only on this song:
* “'I Wish You Would’ is a song that I wrote with Jack Antonoff and it was the first song we ever worked on together. I think, for this song, we wanted to create a sort of John Hughes movie visual with pining and, you know, one person’s over here and misses the other person but is too prideful and won’t say it. Meanwhile this other person is here and missing the same person; they’re missing each other but not saying it. And I had this happen in my life and so I wanted to kind of narrate it in a very cinematic way where it’s like you’re seeing two scenes play out and then in the bridge you’re seeing the final scene, where it resolves itself. So it says, 'It’s a crooked love in a straight line down, makes you wanna run and hide but it makes you turn right back around.’ It kind of is like that dramatic love that’s never really quite where it needs to be and that tension it creates.”
* \[[Voice Memo Intro Transcript](https://href.li/?https://youtu.be/hWJMZyfdROM?si=U9cGLPoityC6tdx9)\] “This is another way I’ve written songs recently. This is a song I did with Jack Antonoff, and Jack is one of my friends and so were hanging out and he pulled out his phone and goes ‘I made this amazing track the other day. It’s so cool, I love these guitar sounds.’ And he played it for me and immediately I could hear this finished song in my head, and I just said ‘Please, please let me have that. Let me play with it, send it to me.’ And so he sent it to me and I was on tour and this was me playing the track on my laptop recording me singing the vocal into my phone and it ended up being a song called 'I Wish You Would', because Jack wrote back and said ‘I love that’. So this is another way of writing, it’s writing to track.”
* \[Secret Sessions\] “Taylor said that she wrote ‘I Wish You Would’ a couple of months after her and Harry Styles broke up, and they decided to become friends again and she said this was the first time she had become friends with an ex, to the point where they were comfortable enough to talk about why the relationship didn’t work out. She said he told her about how, after they broke up, he bought a house literally one road adjacent to hers. Every day he would drive home, and accidentally turn into her street, and he told her how he just wanted to stop at her house and see her, but he never did. She said this song is about while he was in the car making the decision to get out the car and see her, she was sitting in her bedroom, wishing he would make the move and go back to her and just pitch up at her house. She compared it to a classic John Hughes movie where both parties want the same thing but neither has the guts to say anything. Honestly, she spoke so fondly of that relationship.” **\[this is from a secret sessioner and therefore it should be taken with a grain of salt\]**

**Between May 28 and June 2, 2013:** Taylor writes *I Wish You Would*. After this set of shows, she'll settle in Rhode Island basically all summer, so it's possible that she went to Jack's studio in New York by car without being seen and especially photographed, cause I couldn't find any pictures with the same outfit. Conway Studios are also credited but it's possible that she recorded background vocals there. Taylor was in LA in late August.

**June 7, 2013:** During an interview at the CMA Music Festival, Taylor confirms that she has started writing her next album.

* \[[Transcript](https://href.li/?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsMiZ_hHnHE&ab_channel=tayswiftruclub)\] “\[The new album\] is starting, all the anxiety is starting and when the anxiety starts, then the writing happens right afterward usually. I like to write for about two years before I'm finished with an album because at this point I kind of know that whenever I read in the first year is going to get away, because I'm going to like it but it's going to sound a little bit like the last project I had, and the second year usually ends up sounding like the next project. So I think at this point I feel like staying the same is the easy way to go but it's not the way that I want to go creatively. I think you need to challenge yourself, I think you need to change up your influences, I think you need to be inspired by different things that you've been inspired by before. It's harder to call people you don't know, it's harder to think of topics you haven't covered and think of new ways to say old emotions that everyone feels. I think one of the things that I'm happiest with in the last year is the acceptance level in country music for me experimenting and for me trying to evolve and challenge myself musically because I think it's never felt better to be on that stadium stage performing knowing that and so welcoming of change.”

**July 13, 2013:** After a show in New Jersey, Taylor has an interview with Rolling Stone, where she says that she has been writing a lot.

* “The floodgates just opened the last couple weeks,” she says of the songwriting process. “I’m getting to that point where I’m irritating to be around because I’ll be with you for half the conversation and then the second half of the conversation I’m clearly editing the second verse of whatever I’m writing in my head. I *really* loved collaborating: you work with a lot of different people and you find the people you have this dream connection with in the studio. I know those people and I know the ones I want to go back to. But I also have a really long list of the people I admire and I would really love to go and contact. So that’s kind of where that is. I think that the idea of having a different approach to every single one of my albums is so exciting to me. I never want to make the same record twice. Why do it? What’s the point? It’s so overwhelming that when you’re starting a project there are such endless possibilities if you’re willing to evolve and experiment. If you’re willing to become a different version of yourself, you can really go anywhere with it. And that’s kind of where I am. The kind of the laboratory experimental stage of really catching onto a new thing that I’m liking.”

**Somewhere around June and early September 2013:** Taylor and Jack write *Sweeter Than Fiction*. No credits are available but we know that it's the second song on which Taylor and Jack worked, so that places it before *I Wish You Would* and *Out Of The Woods*.

**September 15, 2013:** Jack completes the instrumental track that will later become *Out Of The Woods*, after his show [was cancelled](https://href.li/?https://www.noise11.com/news/fun-down-20130915).

* \[Jack Antonoff\] “When I did the track for Out of the Woods, which is a Taylor song that I'm really proud of, there was some issue at a venue and our show was canceled that night and I didn't have my stuff, I had left it on the bus, so I only had these old samples on what was on my laptop, and caught up that 'oh oh'' thing, and I only had one drum kit on there, and these dumb little things sometimes turn into a great song.”

**Somewhere around September and October 2013:** Taylor writes *Out Of The Woods*.

* [Voice memo here](https://href.li/?https://youtu.be/BvCI33z9wiM?si=WmiiuplzzVNXl0Nb&t=64);
* \[Jack Antonoff\] Although Antonoff and Swift shared studio time for some of their other *1989* songs while working throughout 2014, “Out of the Woods” was completed as a long-distance collaboration. “She’s very natural -— when she gets an idea, it just happens very quickly. I would send her these tracks, and when an idea would happen, we’d be 5,000 miles apart or whatever, but she would start emailing me these voice notes like crazy and it would just be happening so quickly that there’d be this excitement. There’s a frantic feeling in the song,” he says. “What’s interesting about ‘Out of the Woods’ is that it doesn’t really let up. It starts with a pretty big anthemic vocal sample that’s me, and then there’s a drum sample that kicks in that’s kind of huge, and then you don’t really know how you’re going to get any bigger, but then the chorus hits and it just explodes even larger. And then the bridge hits, and it gets even more huge.“When I was working on the track, I was thinking a lot about My Morning Jacket,” Antonoff continues, “and how everything they do, every sound is louder than the last, and somehow it feels like everything is just f—ing massive. And that’s the feeling that I went for. It started out big, and then I think the obvious move would have been to do a down chorus, but the idea was to keep pushing.” Antonoff is excited to share the rest of his work with Swift on *1989*, but he views “Out of the Woods” as a highlight on the project. “This song means a great deal to me. On a production level, on a writing level, Taylor’s lyrics and her melodies — there’s something very important about this song.”
* “It kind of conjured up all these feelings of anxiety I had in a relationship where everybody was watching, everybody was commenting on it. You’re constantly just feeling like, ‘Are we out of the woods yet? What’s the next thing gonna be? What’s the next hurdle we’re gonna have to jump over?’ It was interesting to write about a relationship where you’re just honestly like, ‘This is probably not gonna last, but how long is it gonna last?’ Those fragile relationships... It doesn’t mean they’re not supposed to happen. The whole time we were having happy memories, or crazy memories, or ridiculously anxious times, in my head it was just like, ‘Are we okay yet? Are we there yet? Are we out of this yet?’”
* “That line is in there because it's not only the actual, literal narration of what happened in a particular relationship I was in, it's also a metaphor. 'Hit the brakes too soon' could mean the literal sense of, we got in an accident and we had to deal with the aftermath. But also, the relationship ended sooner than it should've because there was a lot of fear involved. And that song touches on a huge sense of anxiety that was, kind of, coursing through that particular relationship, because we really felt the heat of every single person in the media thinking they could draw up the narrative of what we were going through and debate and speculate. I don't think it's ever going to be easy for me to find love and block out all those screaming voices.”

**October 21, 2013:** *Sweeter Than Fiction* is released. Big Machine was originally not on board with the release since they wanted a dormant period between album releases.

**Late 2013:** Taylor writes *Bad Blood*, after Katy Perry announces her Prismatic World Tour.

* “For years, I was never sure if we were friends or not. She would come up to me at awards shows and say something and walk away, and I would think, ‘Are we friends,or did she just give me the harshest insult of my life?’ Then last year, the other star crossed a line. She did something so horrible. I was like, ‘Oh, we’re just straight-up enemies.’ And it wasn’t even about a guy! It had to do with business. She basically tried to sabotage an entire arena tour. She tried to hire a bunch of people out from under me. And I’m surprisingly non-confrontational – you would not believe how much I hate conflict. So now I have to avoid her. It’s awkward, and I don’t like it.”
* “That was about losing a friend... But then people cryptically tweet about what you meant. I never said anything that would point a finger in the specific direction of one specific person, and I can sleep at night knowing that. I knew the song would be assigned to a person, and the easiest mark was someone who I didn’t want to be labeled with this song. It was not a song about heartbreak. It was about the loss of friendship.”

**October 20 to 22, 2013:** Taylor is in Cape Town (South Africa) shooting *The Giver*. One of the members of the cast is Alexsander Skarsgård. He is said to have inspired *Wildest Dreams* (or at least he's the most popular theory, as far as I know), because the music video is set in Africa and it features Clint Eastwood's son Scott as love interest, just like Alexsander is actor Stellan Skarsgård's son, but we don't actually know more about the song.

* “I think the way I used to approach relationships was very idealistic. I used to go into them thinking, ‘Maybe this is the one – we’ll get married and have a family, this could be forever’. Whereas now I go in thinking, ‘How long do we have on the clock – before something comes along and puts a wrench in it, or your publicist calls and says this isn’t a good idea?’”
* **Note:** Selena Gomez was present when Taylor wrote this song.

**November 19, 2013:** Taylor records Blank Space. This is based on the wall behind her on an Instagram post from this day, the credits, and the behind the scenes clip.

* [Voice memo here](https://href.li/?https://youtu.be/WSo2flkc9VA?si=Zdvv_qAH_uLIGM8y);
* [Behind the Scenes here](https://href.li/?https://youtu.be/EmT8IT2E_f8?t=28s);
* “Every few years, the media finds something they unanimously agree is annoying about me. 2012-2013 they thought I was dating too much, because I dated two people in a year and a half. ‘Oh, a serial dater. She only writes songs to get emotional revenge on guys. She’s a man-hater, don’t let her near your boyfriend.’ It was kind of excessive and at first it was hurtful, but then I found a little bit of comedy in it. This character is so interesting, though. If you read these gossip sites, they describe how I am so opposite to my actual life: I’m clingy, and I’m awful, and I throw fits, and there’s drama. An emotionally fragile, unpredictable mess. I painted a whole picture of this character. She lives in a mansion with marble floors, she wears Dolce & Gabbana around the house, and she wears animal print unironically. So I created this whole character and I had fun doing it.”

**November 21, 2013:** While at the American Music Awards, Taylor tells Billboard that she has around [seven or eight songs ready](https://href.li/?https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&t=61&v=PhY3oSjD4E0&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=Billboard).

* \[Transcript\] “We got a lot already,” says Swift. “There are probably seven or eight songs that I know I want on the record. It’s really ahead of schedule for me. I’m just stoked because it’s already evolved into a new sound, and that’s all I wanted. And I would have taken two years to make that happen, but it just kind of happened naturally, so that’s all I could really ask for.”

**2013:** Taylor writes *New Romantics* and *Wonderland*. Not much is known about these songs, except that they were both written in 2013.

* \[About New Romantics\] “People will say, 'Let me set you up with someone', and I’m just sitting there saying, ‘That’s not what I’m doing. I’m not lonely. I’m not looking.’ They just don’t get it. I’ve learned that just because someone is cute and wants to date you, that’s not a reason to sacrifice your independence and allow everyone to say whatever they want about you. I’m not doing that anymore. It’d take someone really special for me to undergo the circumstances I have to go through to experience a date. I don’t know how I would ever have another person in my world trying to have a relationship with me, or a family.”

**January 6, 2014:** Taylor decides to look for a house in New York.

* \[Lover Journal\] *LA.* So I've decided I want to look at places in New York. I know I went through this phase months ago, but it has to mean something that i've circled back to it, right? You know what they say, if you love something let it go and if it comes back... blah blah blah. so I'm leaving the day after tomorrow. Dating is awful. Love is fiction/ a myth. I'm over it all.

**January 21, 2014:** Taylor sends Ryan Tedder the [*I Know Places Voice Memo*](https://href.li/?https://youtu.be/e9QkWFpb95s?si=30umGwTHZs2-IRdq&t=79).

**January 22, 2014:** \[From the 1989 Booklet\] Taylor and Ryan finish and record I Know Places.

* “I had this idea of like, when you’re in love, along the lines of 'Out of the Woods’, it’s very precious, it’s fragile. As soon as the world gets ahold of it, whether it’s your friends or people around town hear about it... it’s kind of like the first thing people want to do when they hear that people are in love is just kind of try to ruin it. I kind of was in a place where I was like, ‘No one is gonna sign up for this. There are just too many cameras pointed at me. There are too many ridiculous elaborations on my life. It’s just not ever gonna work.‘ But I decided to write a love song, just kind of like, ‘What would I say if I met someone really awesome and they were like, hey, I’m worried about all this attention you get?’ So I wrote this song called ‘I Know Places’ about, ‘Hey, I know places we can hide. We could outrun them.’ I’m so happy that it sounds like the urgency that it sings.”

**January 23, 2014:** Taylor and Ryan Tedder write *Welcome To New York*. Ryan produces a demo in three hours. This demo is the one included in the album.

* “I wanted to start *1989* with this song because New York has been an important landscape and location for the story of my life in the last couple of years. I dreamt and obsessed over moving to New York, and then I did it. The inspiration that I found in that city is hard to describe and to compare to any other force of inspiration I’ve ever experienced in my life. It’s an electric city.”
* \[Ryan Tedder\] “I thought we were going to walk in and start something from scratch because that's what I was used to. Then she calls me and says, 'Is it cool if I already have an idea?' I said, 'Sure.' She said, 'I have this song, I'm obsessed with New York and I just moved there, I want to write an ode to New York because no one's done it in a long time.' And then she sent me a voice memo. She's like, 'I want it to sound like the 1980s.' So the next day I brought in a Juno-106, which is a very 1980s keyboard, and I literally programmed that entire song right in front of her. It was very much on the fly, and that song was done in about three hours. And I did the rest of the production I think later that week.”
* Handwritten lyrics:

**January 26, 2014:** Night of the 56th Grammy Awards. Taylor delivers a legendary performance of *All Too Well*, but loses the Album Of The Year Award to *Random Access Memory* by Daft Punk. This will prompt Taylor to make a ""sonically cohesive"" pop album.

* \[Lover Journal\] January 25th. *LA.* It's the middle of the night and I was at the Clive Davis Party tonight which means... the Grammys are tomorrow. Never have I felt so good about our chances. Never have I wanted something as badly as I want to hear them say 'Red' is the Album of the Year.
* “It was the night of the Grammys this year. I remember going home and playing a lot of the new music I had recorded for some of my backup singers and one of my best friends. We were all sitting in the kitchen and I was playing them all this music, and they were just saying, ‘You know, this is very eighties. It’s very clear to us that this is so eighties.’ We were just talking and talking about how it’s kind of a rebirth in a new genre, how that’s a big, bold step. Kind of starting a part of your career over. When they left that night, I just had this very clear moment of, ‘It’s gotta be called *1989*.’”
* “I woke up one morning at 4 a.m. and I decided the album is called *1989.* I’ve been making ‘80s synth pop, I’m just gonna do *that*. I’m calling it a pop record. I’m not listening to anyone at my label. I’m starting tomorrow. I liked the idea of collaborating. But with *1989* I decided to narrow down the list. It wasn’t going to be 10 producers, it was going to be a very small team of four or five people I always wanted to work with, or loved working with. And Max Martin and I were going to oversee it, and we were going to make a sonically cohesive record again.”

**January 2014:** Taylor writes *You Are In Love.* This is actually speculation but it's based on (1) Taylor going to NY in early January and (2) Jack Antonoff confirming that it was the fourth song they did and (3) it's the only Antonoff-produced song that is copyrighted in 2014. Based on the credits, I'm pretty sure that Taylor and Jack worked on the song separately, with Jack recording the instrumental at the Jungle City Studios in NY (which is a studio that [Jack used in 2014](https://href.li/?https://www.soundonsound.com/people/jack-antonoff) to record Bleachers' first album *Strange Desire*) and Taylor recording the vocals at Conway Studio in LA.

* “I wrote it with my friend Jack Antonoff who’s dating my friend Lena. Jack sent me this song, it was just an instrumental track he was working on and immediately I knew the song it needed to be. And I wrote it as a kind of commentary on what their relationship has been like. So it’s actually me looking and going, ‘This happened and that happened, then that happened and that’s how you knew you are in love.’”
* “I’ve never had that, so I wrote that song about things that Lena Dunham has told me about her and Jack Antonoff. That’s just basically stuff she’s told me. And I think that that kind of relationship — God, it sounds like it would just be so beautiful — would also be hard. It would also be mundane at times.”
* “We first worked on 'I Wish You Would' together and realized we kind of have a good thing, and the next thing we did was ‘Sweeter Than Fiction,’ which was on the \[*One Chance*\] soundtrack, and after that we did ‘Out of the Woods’ and another song called ‘You Are in Love.’

**January 26, 2014:** At the Grammy's, Diane Warren reveals that she and Taylor [wrote a song together](https://href.li/?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kjwr9z_eiVw).

* \[Transcript\] “I worked with Taylor Swift on a great song. I don't even know what she's done \[for her next album\], I'm excited about the one that we did, it's pretty cool.”
* \[[Billboard 2016 Interview\]](https://href.li/?https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/diane-warren-michelle-obama-this-is-for-my-girls-interview-7262719/) “I know \[Swift\] likes it, so hopefully it will see the light of day. I know she really likes the song. She didn’t want me to give it away, so hopefully that means she wants it.”

**February 9, 2014:** \[From the 1989 Booklet\] While in London, during the European leg of the *Red* Tour, Taylor and Imogen Heap write *Clean* in just 9 hours at Imogen's home studio. Taylor will sing the song just two times.

* [Voice memo here](https://href.li/?https://youtu.be/BvCI33z9wiM?si=sbldLbDF3_4eMNO1&t=38);
* “'Clean' I wrote as I was walking out of Liberty in London. Someone I used to date – it hit me that I’d been in the same city as him for two weeks and I hadn’t thought about it. When it did hit me, it was like, ‘Oh, I hope he’s doing well’. And nothing else. And you know how it is when you’re going through heartbreak. A heartbroken person is unlike any other person. Their time moves at a completely different pace than ours. It’s this mental, physical, emotional ache and feeling so conflicted. Nothing distracts you from it. Then time passes, and the more you live your life and create new habits, you get used to not having a text message every morning saying, ‘Hello, beautiful. Good morning.’ You get used to not calling someone at night to tell them how your day was. You replace these old habits with new habits, like texting your friends in a group chat all day, and planning fun dinner parties, and going out on adventures with your girlfriends, and then all of a sudden one day you’re in London and you realize you’ve been in the same place as your ex for two weeks and you’re fine. And you hope he’s fine. The first thought that came to my mind was – I’m finally clean.”
* “'Clean' is the last song on the album for a lot of reasons, but mostly because it felt like the complication of this emotional process I’ve been going through for the last couple of years. You know, I feel like my personal life was really, really discussed, and criticized, and debated, and talked about to a point where it made me feel almost kind of tarnished, in a way. And the discussion wasn’t about music. It broke my heart that I had made an album that I was proud of, and I was touring the world, and playing sold-out stadiums, and still they managed to only want to talk about my personal life. At a certain point I felt a switch and it was at the end of recording this album that I began to feel like my life was mine again and my music was at the forefront again. I was living my life on my own terms and I really no longer cared what people were saying about me. That was when I started so see people talk less about the things that didn’t matter.”
* “I had this metaphor in my head about being in this house, there’s been a drought but you feel like there’s a storm coming. Instead of trying to block out the storm you punch a hole in the roof and just let all the rain come in, and when you wake up in the morning, it’s washed away.”
* **\[Imogen Heap\]** “We met at my studio in London. She had the bare bones of “Clean.” She had the lyric, the chorus and the chords. I thought it was brilliant.I was really writing the tiniest amount just to help her do what she does. I put some noises, played various instruments on it, including drums, and anytime she expressed she liked something I was doing, I did it *more*. It was a really fun day. She recorded all her vocals during that one session. She did two takes, and the second take was it. We always thought she would probably re-record it, because we thought it can’t possibly be that easy. But after we lived with it for a few months, we felt it was great. I knew she loved it. She said she loved it and her mum loved it. But I wasn’t sure it would be included on the album. But everyone felt it had something special. It came together really magically.”
* \[Taylor about Imogen Heap\] “The coolest thing about Imogen for me was that there was no one else in the studio. There was no assistant; there was no engineer. It was her doing everything.”

**February 11, 2014:** Taylor [gets a haircut.](https://href.li/?https://twitter.com/ThrowbackTaylor/status/1624215861379715082) (I'm including this for funsies)

**February 15, 2014:** Taylor, Max Martin and Shellback write *Shake It Off*.

* [Voice memo here](https://href.li/?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvCI33z9wiM&ab_channel=DazzlingBurritoes);
* \[Lover Journal\] *LA.* This week I've been in the studio with Max and Johan every day and it has been the most creatively successful and fulfilling time. The first day, Johan just made a really up tempo drum beat because we decided we needed something up and light. We worked at it for a few hours before i just started singing ""shake it off, shake it off, shake it off"" And then the best way i know how to describe it is that the chorus just fell out of the sky. It ended up being this song about doing your own thing even though haters are gonna hate, and you just have to dance to your own beat. We all went home and I wrote the first and second verses and brought them in the next day. We wrote this chanty cheer leader bridge that I absolutely LOVE. We spent all day doing vocals and the next day recording the background vocals. I think it'll end up being the first single and Max said it's his favorite song he's ever been a part of.
* \[Max Martin during the lawsuit\] “Shellback started out with a drumbeat. Shellback, Taylor, and I then collaboratively developed the melody and other lines of ‘Shake It Off’ to Shellback’s drumbeat. I did not write or provide any input into any lyrics in ‘Shake It Off,’ which were written entirely by Taylor.”
* “I've had every part of my life dissected – my choices, my actions, my words, my body, my style, my music. When you live your life under that kind of scrutiny, you can either let it break you, or you can get really good at dodging punches. And when one lands, you know how to deal with it. And I guess the way that I deal with it is to shake it off.”
* “The message in the song is a problem I think we all deal with and an issue we deal with on a daily basis. We don’t live just in a celebrity takedown culture, we live in a takedown culture. People will find anything about you and twist it to where it’s weird or wrong or annoying or strange or bad. You have to not only live your life in spite of people who don’t understand you, you have to have more fun than they do.”

**February 19, 2014:** Taylor, Max Martin, Shellback and Ali Payami write *Style*. This is the last song made for the album.

* “I loved comparing these timeless visuals with a feeling that never goes out of style. It's basically one of those relationships that's always a bit off. The two people are trying to forget each other. So, it's like, 'All right, I heard you went off with her, and well, I've done that, too.' My previous albums have also been sort of like, 'I was right, you were wrong, you did this, it made me feel like this' – a righteous sense of right and wrong in a relationship. What happens when you grow up is you realize the rules in a relationship are very blurred and that it gets very complicated very quickly, and there's not a case of who was right or who was wrong.”
* “This song is about those relationships that are never really done. You always kind of have that person, that one person who you feel might interrupt your wedding and be like, ‘Don’t do it cause we’re not over yet.'”

**February 19, 2014:** While on tour, Ryan Tedder produces another three versions of *Welcome To New York.*

* \[[Ryan Tedder](https://href.li/?https://ew.com/music/ryan-tedder-songwriting-hits-beyonce-adele-taylor-swift/) interview\] “I was in Switzerland on a tour bus, and I did four versions of 'Welcome to New York,' one of which I liked personally more, but the thing about artists is they become very obsessed with the demo. She was in love with the demo so no matter how hard I fought, she brought it back to the demo, so really what you hear is what I did on the first day.”

**March 24, 2014:** \[From a Lover Journal\] Taylor moves to New York.

* \[Lover Journal\] So in the last few weeks, I've completely moved into my apartment in Tribeca. That's right, I'm writing this from my new bed in my new place, watching Law and Order with Meredith. Strangely, I've never felt more busy.

**May 29, 2014:** \[From a Lover Journal\] Taylor chooses another photo for the cover, after having a nightmare of the previous one being not enough.

**May 30, 2014:** Taylor chooses the album cover.

* *\[Lover Journal\] Shanghai.* So we got to China at around 2pm and I knew it would completely ruin me if I slept when i got to the hotel, so I decided to work out. WHY IS THIS PEN RUNNING OUT?! Just went to my purse and got my pen. So a crazy story unfolded in the last 24 hours. Last night, I had this vivid dream where the photo I'd chosen for the album cover wasn't good enough, intriguing enough, artful enough. it woke me up. I couldn't shake it and it stayed with me all day. Because that nagging feeling I'd been pushing back for weeks was now confirmed in my gut... it wasn't good enough. I went to the venue, mind racing, wandering if I'd have to do an entirely new photo shoot... I got to my dressing room with newer versions of the ""cover"" I looked at it and felt nothing. The team pulled up this new scanned file of the polaroids we had taken during the shoot. I saw it within 10 seconds. The shot. The cover. It's a polaroid of me sitting against a beige wall with a blue seagull sweatshirt on. You can see my red lips but the photo cuts off my eyes. For some reason unknown to me it's the most intriguing photo i've seen. I think it's the mystery of not seeing my eyes. Maybe it just looks effortlessly cool. The craziest moment came when something caught my eye. The cover photo is photo 13. I kid you not. I played a sold out show in Shanghai tonight and the crowd was amazing. Tomorrow we go to Tokyo, where they'll have the whole ticker tape parade at the airport. Smile and wave...

**Conclusive notes**

**What** ***1989*** **represented for Taylor**:

* “The 1980s was a very experimental time in pop music. People realized songs didn't have to be this standard drums-guitar-bass-whatever. We can make a song with synths and a drum pad. We can do group vocals for the entire song. We can do so many different things. And I think what you saw happening with music was also happening in our culture, where people were just wearing whatever crazy colors they wanted to, because why not? There just seemed to be this energy about endless opportunities, endless possibilities, endless ways you could live your life. And so with this record, I thought, 'There are no rules to this. I don't need to use the same musicians I've used, or the same band, or the same producers, or the same formula. I can make whatever record I want.'”
* “In the past, I've written mostly about heartbreak or pain that was caused by someone else and felt by me. On this album, I'm writing about more complex relationships, where the blame is kind of split 50–50 ... even if you find the right situation relationship-wise, it's always going to be a daily struggle to make it work.”

"Hi everyone, I saw this posted on another sub and was wondering what people’s thoughts are on joining in? These changes will make it really hard for people with disability to access Reddit :( something that I feel very strongly about. Would love to see our inclusive Swiftie community join in.

r/taylorswift is joining the Reddit blackout from June 12th to protest the planned API changes that will kill 3rd party apps and Reddit access for vision impaired people

Hey r/taylorswift

Recently Reddit Inc has announced changes to their API which, if enacted, will shut down many, if not all, 3rd party apps that a large number of Redditors use to access and enjoy their favourite communities. Critically, this also completely guts access to Reddit for visually impaired people as screen readers are 3rd party apps.

One of the most critical changes to the API is that it is moving from a free to a paid model, resulting in expenses that developers of 3rd party apps simply cannot afford. To put the price change in to context, Apollo, one of the most popular 3rd party apps for Reddit, is looking at a cost of US$1.7 million per month to continue operating. That's a cost of US$12,000 per 50 million API requests. In contrast, Apollo pays Imgur US$166 for every 50 million API calls.

This means popular apps like [Apollo](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/), [Reddit Is Fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/13wxepd/rif_dev_here_reddits_api_changes_will_likely_kill/), [Narwhal](https://www.reddit.com/r/getnarwhal/comments/13wv038/reddit_have_quoted_the_apollo_devs_a_ridiculous/jmdqtyt/) and many more will have to shut down, permanently.

Even if you're not using a 3rd party app yourself, these changes are likely to impact the communities you enjoy as well, with the vast majority of moderation teams relying on 3rd party or self-made tools, that utilise Reddit's API.

Additionally, if you are a member of a community that uses bots - those will also cease to function.

And on top of all that, it paints a bleak picture of what is to come for those of us who use other tools, like Reddit Enhancement Suite and old.reddit.com.

[Here's a little TLDR on why this is important](https://i.imgur.com/E7jSWf1.jpg).

**So what are we planning?**

On June 12th, [we and a growing number of other subs](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) \- large and small - will go dark. During that time, you will not be able to view or post any content on r/taylorswift from June 12th 0:00 EST to June 13th 11:59 EST.

This action isn't something we take lightly.

We understand that Reddit is a company that has to make money in order to offer us a place to be the community that we are - but killing 3rd party apps is not the way to do it.

We are not asking Reddit to provide a paid service for free - we are asking for reasonable pricing for apps that people have come to love and depend on to participate in their communities.

We can't tell you that the blackout will solve the problem, because we simply don't know. But we have to try.

**What you can do to support this**

While subs going dark is one thing, regular users can help as well.

Reach out to Reddit via the channels available to you: Modmail [r/reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/), comment in relevant posts regarding the API changes, submit your comments via the contact forms.

Spread the word about the changes and the consequences where you can. Doesn't have to be on Reddit. The important thing is getting it attention.

Participate in the communities that highlight this issue: [r/Save3rdPartyApps](https://www.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/), [r/apolloapp](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/), [r/redditisfun](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/), [r/getnarwhal](https://www.reddit.com/r/getnarwhal/)

And finally stay off Reddit completely from June 12th to 14th. The blackout is one thing, but users staying away from the site entirely will send an equally important message.

But don't forget: Don't be a jerk. As frustrating as this is, being toxic or aggressive is not the way to go. Remember the human on the other side of the screen.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/142br1i/reddit_blackout_to_support_people_with_disability/,Reddit Blackout to support people with disability,TaylorSwift,t3_142br1i,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/142br1i/reddit_blackout_to_support_people_with_disability/,2023-06-06 10:38:24,Taylor Swift,0.11078331
"Hello! My name is Cokebottlewithnolid and I am hosting a game called Swiftie Bingo!

  How to Play:  The bingo card template that I have created can be found in the link, please make a copy.   You must choose 10 songs from each of Taylor’s 10 Albums (Taylor Swift, Fearless, Speak Now, Red, 1989, Reputation, Lover, folklore, evermore, Midnights.) All songs from deluxe versions will be called, however extra things (Piano/Pop versions, voice memos, messages, etc.) will not be called, then add them to their respective cells. 

Then choose 4 FTV tracks from each of the four TV albums, please do not use TV songs. And finally, the 5 Wild spaces are where you can choose any song from any of the 10 albums or FTV tracks. Please do not choose songs that are from Beautiful Eyes, any of the Christmas tunes or any singles unless they are from their specific album.  

Each day I will be randomly spinning a wheel and posting the result of the wheel, if you have that specific song, use the line tool or something that will show you that the song has been called.  

A Songs Called List will be posted with the bingo call for anyone to make sure that any missing songs have been crossed off, or for anyone who wants to join the game. 

 We will be following classic American Bingo rules, so the winners of each of the different patterns will win the following: 

 Line-A shoutout

 X-A shoutout 

Blackout-A certificate   

Rules:  

Ronan is not going to be called or should be used in this game due to the r/taylorgameswannaplay rules. 

 If you get a bingo, immediately call bingo in the comments of the most recent song post, do NOT wait until you have multiple lines to call bingo, the first person that calls it will get the win.  

If a song that you have missed gets you a bingo, DO NOT call bingo, if you have missed crossing off songs and you get a bingo from the most recent song, then you may call bingo  

Please don’t fake fake fake fake fake, it ruins the game for everyone.

"Far be it for me to contradict Dr Swift but I am not sure being male and turning up to a Taylor Swift concert is a sign of emotional intelligence. And incidentally unironically liking the Barbie movie isn't either. I honestly believe there is something more profound going on.

I have, over the last few years, had my optimism about the future sucked out of me. The issues of climate change, populist fuckwittery and the feeling that battles for equity and equality I thought were won turned out not to have been have worn me down. The unvarnished joy of Swifties communing has restored some of my hope for the future.

When I became a fan of Taylor in 2020 I kept my thoughts to myself, especially with male friends. In 2023 there are still some comments about Taylor just being a pop pixie but they are way less. Men are taking her more seriously. And, perhaps over optimistically, I think men are taking women's political and social power more seriously than they have before.

There have been serious discussions in the Financial Times and Economist about the implications of Taylor Swift and Barbie on society. This was not happening 3 years ago. The notion that a man liking art that was made by women is odd or suspect is being eroded.

I have been assured by women on this subreddit that I and my cohort of older Swiftie men are welcome and the evidence from the concerts is that that is true. I don't think we are any more emotionally intelligent or enlightened than anyone else. Just that the tide is turning away from male dominated culture and politics and we have latched on to one aspect of it.

The power for good of people like Taylor is phenomenal. However it is not her but the millions of Swifties who will make the real difference. I had a spate of Tik Toks appear on my feed by older male Swifties this evening articulating their appreciation of their acceptance and just wanted to share my thoughts.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/15j4uv8/are_swiftie_men_emotionally_intelligent_or_are_we/,Are Swiftie men emotionally intelligent or are we just bowing to the inevitable,TaylorSwift,t3_15j4uv8,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/15j4uv8/are_swiftie_men_emotionally_intelligent_or_are_we/,2023-08-05 19:49:08,Taylor Swift,0.4269174

&#x200B;

**ISO:**

All ISO related posts should be commented in this megathread from now on. *Individual ISO posts will be removed.*

&#x200B;

**SELLING & TRADING:**

Please review the [selling](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwiftMerch/wiki/selling) & [trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwiftMerch/wiki/trading) rules before commenting. As a reminder, your Reddit account should be at least one month old if you want to sell or trade.

The *basic* rules are (but PLEASE review the full rules):

* **You MUST upload a photo of the items you are trading or selling** \- No stock images or images that are not yours. You can upload images to Imgur and share the link in a comment on this post. **THIS ALSO APPLIES TO TRADE OFFERS. Comment with a photo of your item you are offering to trade before private messaging.**
   * Any very RARE items should have a photo with a handwritten timestamp (your Reddit username and the date handwritten on a piece of paper).
   * i.e. ""Record Store Days"" Vinyl Records, 'Lover' Snow Globe, Signed Items, and Lithographs
* If you are interested in a sale or trade, comment ""Sent a private message to you. I accept your listed price or I have X item to trade"" so the moderator(s) know who is reaching out to who.
* No ""Taking offers"" comments - **Items being sold must have a clear price**. If anyone tries to sell something to you ABOVE their listed price - please let the moderators know.
   * If you want to negotiate a lower price or offer something else that is not an ISO, please do so in the comments first.
   * Insane price gouging is not allowed.
   * If you are unsure about the value of an item, feel free to make a post with the ""Fair Trade/Value Question"" flair.
* ***Please edit your comment once you've accepted an offer and tag the user you are selling or trading to.***
* **No trade or sale sniping** \- If an offer is accepted, other members should wait 24 hours before commenting to ask if the transaction went through. If two users make the same offer, the person who offered first gets priority.

There are a lot of scammers out there or bad sellers so these rules are in place to help protect the members of this subreddit. There are new members joining every day and some people are completely new to Reddit. No worries if you make some mistakes.

Hey Swifties! 💕
I was wondering if you have songs where you just recently realized how good they actually are. Maybe it's because she performs them on tour or has sung them as a surprise song, maybe because of the re-recordings... Or you simply listened to a song randomly and suddenly loved it!

Here are my examples:

From Fearless -  The Way I Loved You, Jump Then Fall, Tell Me Why & TOSOTD. I appreciate Fearless a lot more since the re-recording came out and before that I never really paid attention to the mentioned songs but they are actually so good?? Safe to say that especially TWILY is now in my top 3 from this album. 

From Speak Now - Back To December. This song was good before but the re-recording? That's just chefs kiss 💕

From Red - Come Back...Be Here. Before the re-recording I kinda forgot this song even existed and now I ask myself how could live without it? Such a good and underappreciated song! ❤️

From Folklore - Illicit Affairs. The Eras Tour version of this song is so so good!! Can't wait to hear it live next year 🥺 Before that it was somewhere in the middle of my folklore ranking, now it's definitely higher!

From Evermore - Ivy & Marjorie. Ivy for the same reason as Illicit Affairs. It sounded so good when she sang it as a surprise song! And Marjorie is a lovely, even if an unexpected addition to the setlist (at least for me). In general Evermore is probably my least favorite album (because I just prefer the others more!), I still love it but ever since the tour it has been growing on me a lot as a whole which is awesome ❤️

I hope this wasn't too long haha but I would love to hear yours if you have any! 😊",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/14zuuo5/what_songs_grew_on_you_over_time/,What song(s) grew on you over time?,TaylorSwift,t3_14zuuo5,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/14zuuo5/what_songs_grew_on_you_over_time/,2023-07-14 22:55:19,Taylor Swift,0.1373533

"I went to the NeedToBreathe concert in Minneapolis on November 4th, and they mentioned how they toured with Taylor back in the Speak Now era. They talked about this to intro their song “We Could Run Away” which they said was Taylor’s favorite song of theirs. I just thought this was interesting looking at the lyrics: 

Everything stops, as we look towards the clock
It feels like we're moving backwards
It's easy to find potential in before
But we look the same in the afters
So could we wait long enough to bide my time?
Could we stay and say enough to change my mind?

'Cause we could run away
Maybe we could change
Get back on our feet and then
Maybe make it home again
We could run away
Be on our own again

Maybe in the twilight
We can break out
Buy ourselves a Cadillac
Never turn around
We could run away
And be on our own again

We could stay here where things became unclear
Fighting what's left of the right way
But everyone hates the chances that we waste
Under the light of the new day
So could we wait long enough to bide my time?
Could we stay and say enough to change my mind?

It’s giving vibes of being closeted and in a secret relationship, no?

"Had to get this out somewhere. I'm probably the only one who thinks this, but I'm going to try to defend my point here.

The way 'Maroon' is constructed - the drone in the background, the drowsy beat, the vocals fading in and out towards the end - makes me think it would be great music for a ""taking drugs"" scene in a movie, maybe as the introduction to a character with those kinds of problems. Am I crazy? It's definitely an unorthodox kind of song for that context, but I think it could work.

Either way, I think it's one of the more underrated songs on the album. And now that I've made you read all that, I shall politely accept my cancellation.

"It is well known that one reason Taylor Swift is so impressive is because she is also a great songwriter. She has writing credits on all her songs, and many of her lyrics are compared to poetry, literature, or the works of William Shakespeare.

(This is true for some genres more than others: indie/folk I also believed that most artists at least tried to care about their own work and their fans (maybe not to Taylor Swift's extent, but at least they were trying). This... didn't turn out to be true  for many of them. 

I thought that what Taylor Swift is doing was what everyone else aspired to be. That isn't true. 

The fact that this isn't true for many artists makes Taylor Swift even more admirable. Her love of her craft, her writing skills, and her appreciation for her fans are to be respected even if you are not a fan of her music.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/142qea1/my_taylor_swift_misconceptions_about_other_artists/,My Taylor Swift misconceptions about other artists,TaylorSwift,t3_142qea1,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/142qea1/my_taylor_swift_misconceptions_about_other_artists/,2023-06-06 19:16:23,Taylor Swift,0.14950264

"Hi Swifties! As I mentioned previously, a group of us worked together to shuffle the songs around in the various pen styles. While we had a lot of fun seeing how everyone voted, we needed to even out the amount of songs in each pen style per album in order to turn this into a fun elimination game! We used playlists stated to be curated by Taylor to shift songs first. After that, we got together and discussed which songs could be on the borderline of being another pen style which included moving some of the songs Taylor put in a specific style herself. The only exception to this was the folkmore sisters as we could not justify enough songs for glitter gel pen; those albums will be quill and fountain only.

The playlists are below. While fountain pen's playlist includes SYGB and BTTWS, neither will participate in game. Those two songs were not shuffled.

Each round for the game will last three days. Each pen style for each album will have their own round but all pen styles for the album will be happening at the same time (this hurt my head to write lol). Soon we will be starting with Debut's Fountain Pens, tomorrow will be Debut's Glitter Gel, and then the following day will be Debut's Quill Pen.

"I just listened to this song for the first time. Please please please keep in mind that this girl is ten years old. I think she wrote this song on her own, which is MAJORLY impressive. 

But there was one line that kind of made me cringe a little bit, and that was “never find a lover”. Obviously this is a reference to Taylor’s song, but the whole concept of this song is her saying that she wants to be like Taylor. Which is cool. What ten year old DOESN’T want to be famous is some kind of way?

But she is saying she doesn’t want to find love (at least not now) like Taylor. Obviously this girl is ten years old. Way too young to be thinking about love lol. I’m sixteen and it still freaks me out, but what bothered me is her kind of saying Taylor will never find a lover. 

It’s not my place to tell Taylor what she should do in her life, nor do I care. I just want her to be happy. But she has said before in interviews and even recent songs that she wants to find her person in life, and this girl is kind of saying she won’t. 

I’m probably reading WAY to much into it, she’s ten. But it just bothered me a little bit. 

Overall the song is actually pretty good. It’s fun, kind of catchy, and overall pretty good! If it came up on my shuffle or on the radio I would have fun singing and dancing along. But what do you guys think of this song?

"Howdy Swiftie reddit, this is my first ever post so bear with me!

I spent a chunk of time yesterday creating an acoustics only playlist of Taylor's songs, because I am an absolute *sucker* for a good acoustic rendition (literally when artists release them it makes my entire life), and thus I ask a very important question -- what is your favorite acoustic version Taylor has done? And what are some of your dream songs to hear as an acoustic? Live renditions if done acoustically totally count. I also personally include the long pond studio sessions as acoustics because they sound so different arrangement wise and are more stripped down.

I would kill for an acoustic rendition a la long pond of Lover and Midnights (especially as someone who doesn't like Midnights much on it's own -- sorry! -- due to the production, I feel like I could appreciate it much more with a stripped down acoustic album).

For my favorite already existent one, although it is SO difficult, I would have to go with the ""mirrorball"" version on long pond -- I wasn't much of a fan of that song originally, but when I heard it in that arrangement it literally became one of my fave Taylor songs so fast. That's the power of an acoustic <3 Honorable mention to the Lavender Haze acoustic because the guitar on that is straight fire.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/12pw75x/fave_taylor_acoustic_versions/,Fave Taylor Acoustic versions?,TaylorSwift,t3_12pw75x,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/12pw75x/fave_taylor_acoustic_versions/,2023-04-17 20:47:34,Taylor Swift,0.37576625

"Taylor Swift is extremely successful and justifiably so, but there are some moments of her career that leave me scratching my head. 

Why did she even participate in ""Cats"" at all? The play is very difficult to adapt properly, and many people including myself knew it was going to bomb from day 1. Not even a Sonic Movie esque redesign could have saved it. 

ME! as a single is going to show up here. I know it's to differentiate from ""reputation"", but many people such as myself dislike this song being a single when Cruel Summer exists. 

No ""Evermore Long Pond"" is another one. Maybe this will happen eventually, but I think this was a big missed opportunity. 

Let's Go (Battle) should appear on Speak Now (Taylor's Version) (there's still a chance, but I fear it will not show up). This song was hyped up by the fanbase, and I believe the ""fight"" theme might also relate to a more modern context with the masters villains. 

Obviously everything related to Matty Healy, but this is more about music/career decisions and not personal life.

"Hey Swifties! When the Eras Tour officially started in mid-March, I vowed to myself that I would do my best to avoid spoilers. After having the giant snakes spoiled during Rep, I decided I didn’t want to know ANYTHING: the setlist, the costumes, nothing! And I did a pretty dang good job, though I had to go off TikTok completely to get it done (my algorithm knows me too well). A few things slipped through the cracks (dang it, Buzzfeed, for writing about the stage dive!), but for the most part, I went into the show completely blind and had an absolute BLAST being delightfully surprised (to put it mildly) each time a song and era came on. 

With all of that said, I’m back in the loop now since I attended Nashville night two, and I gotta know: what did I miss? What’s the tour gossip??? Some examples of things I did not know:

-Taylor giving her hat away during “22”?!? How does that work?
-Secret songs from other shows?
-Things cut and added from show to show?
-Celebrity appearances at other shows?
-Little speeches Taylor gave during different shows?

"So I came across this old article from 2016 where they interviewed this guy who was apparently a family friend of Taylor’s who lived next door to her and worked as her photographer when she was a kid/teen. This guy definitely comes off as creepy and could just be looking for attention, so of course the article should be taken with a grain of salt. But THIS part stuck out to me and I thought everyone here might find it interesting…. 👀


So when Taylor is ready for love in, say, 10 years or more, who does Andrew think the lucky guy will be? Well, first of all, wrong gender.

"So ever since the time article came out I have heavily been considering one particular quote. 

&#x200B;

>*“But then I think, Who am I to challenge it, if that’s how she felt? The point is: she* ***felt*** *canceled. She* ***felt*** *as if her career had been taken from her. Something in her had been lost, and she was grieving it. Maybe this is the real Taylor Swift effect: That she gives people, many of them women, particularly girls, who have been conditioned to accept dismissal, gaslighting, and mistreatment from a society that treats their emotions as inconsequential, permission to believe that their interior lives matter. That for your heart to break, whether it’s from being kicked off a tour or by the memory of a scarf still sitting in a drawer somewhere or because somebody else controls your life’s work, is a valid wound, and no, you’re not crazy for being upset about it, or for wanting your story to be told. After all, not to be corny, haven’t we all become selective autobiographers in the digital age as we curate our lives for our own audiences of any size—cutting away from the raw fabric of our lived experience to reveal the shape of the story we most want to tell, whether it’s on our own feeds or the world’s stage? I can’t blame her for being better at it than everyone else. “*

&#x200B;

This part really delves into some things I find really interesting as an idea and on some level can agree. I can agree that people can be having a very large internal struggle while at the same time appear on an external level to be doing fine. And I also understand this idea of her being afraid that she was going to lose her career because I think the unknown is the thing that scares humans the most. The unknown consequence, the aftermath that we can't control. And I also agree that there is something in society that minimizes the feelings of women. I think a lot of women experience their feelings either being trivialized or they experience their anger at another person being reflected back to them and they're wrong for having their reaction. Although I don't know that it's a unique problem unique to women. I think you'll find lots of bipoc and queer people who also have their feelings and their internal reality challenged just as frequently as sometimes to a much more detrimental extent. 

And this is where I really want to get into the conclusion the author comes to which basically sounds like it doesn't matter if Taylor's feelings about a moment are rooted in reality as long as she genuinely felt that way. And that doesn't sit right with me though. And I mean this less talking about the exact specific experience that Taylor is talking about but more from the idea that women are going to be reading this and applying that quote to themselves. Like I was thinking so many TERFs Have a platform rooted in fear of trans women and this idea that they're dangerous. Even if they genuinely believe that to be true it is categorically false. It's not a reasonable take to have. It also victimizes another person and so it would be unethical to validate those feelings. So then it really made me start pondering ----where is this line between validating another person to emotional experience and telling them they need to bffr because their feelings are not rooted in reality?

I feel like there needs to be both because I totally agree that we need to foster understanding we need to be empathizing with another person and what they're telling us but I also feel sometimes it does a disservice to a person when you don't challenge them sometimes and say, ‘this is not objective reality this is the feeling inside yourself and you need to unpack that’. I think sometimes that's the kind of tough love that actually helps you grow. 

Furthermore on the topic of women specifically I also hate this idea that we take the reality that women are sometimes it dismissed in our emotions but then decide the conclusion is that women have to be treated like fragile glass birds or something as though we're just gonna be hysterical if someone points out to us that a feeling we have might be illogical ---because that solution is rooted in the idea that women are illogical and that we can't be a part of any critical thinking or self-reflection. Like this kid glove treatment can't be the answer. I don’t know that I find the conclusion of this idea presented by Time to be empowering as much as I find it infantilizing. 

There has to be a way where women who have encountered a lot of minimization of our feelings or being faulted for the feelings that we have or encountered some kind of emotional or psychological abuse, that we don't then decide our internal self is now given permission to steamroll reality in order for us to heal. 

Because we can definitely have situations where we are victims but other situations where we are just wrong and our feelings about a situation are uninformed. I'm afraid of this runaway train of women who can't be held accountable for their feelings because to them that feeling was *real*.  I really fear that there are some women who are gonna take specific terms in order to make themselves comfortable while they refuse to grow and heal. And so now when someone is taking in an unreasonable stance they’ll just dress it up in some kind of girl boss feminism sparkle and say “don’t minimize my feelings about this. I’m a woman and this is how I feel!” And it’s this risk of this becoming a thing women use to shield themselves from criticism or accountability that really bothers me. It's important to distinguish between expressing your feelings and manipulative use of identity or terminology to avoid personal growth and responsibility.

So I wanted to have a constructive open dialogue with other people who have thoughts on this section in general about validating feelings vs holding ourselves accountable for acknowledging objectivity.

"[The picture on the left is what Taylor changed into immediately after the show the other night, before waving to a bunch of fans as she left. ](https://preview.redd.it/xkj7j0vunpqa1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=73354eb5874cafd936362b528f8e31119f997c8e)

Lets talk about this because I think Taylor’s doing it on purpose. Thanks to u/Clandestine_Duck because it was her idea initially, that I've expanded on. 

Remember when the main Taylor Swift subreddit was complaining about how different the sound was for this album than the aesthetic?  

https://preview.redd.it/i8rw8sstopqa1.png?width=910&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2221b1e38b3a7063718c665287991aa242dfd60d

 I think it's because her promo was largely Taylor and the award show looks are TaylorSwift™️. 

https://preview.redd.it/lk5q2bsxppqa1.png?width=3854&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f64464b9c7ca99c082f910953472b9fe337e2fad

Just like the one on the left is regular Taylor, and the right is TaylorSwift™️ in her stage outfit with the pointer she wields just like that golf club during Blank Space.  

[Which is again, a persona she created to parody the public opinion of her. ](https://preview.redd.it/7r1kjwe8qpqa1.png?width=472&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=36a1496a8b1d422fcc4a8b8e0cbebd0982073a11)

https://preview.redd.it/87qx7k5fqpqa1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fc9f71831c2fe0907d3cc48a5f56ab44aee71a95

Taylor does the song writing, and TaylorSwift™️ does the performing, and I know for the most part this is obvious to us because we talk about Taylor's dual persona's all the time but its fascinating how much thought and effort she's putting in to really showing that divide between her on stage persona and off stage self with Midnights. I think it's affecting her on stage speeches too, where her intros are often a bit faux (Betty anyone? 🙄)  but the spoken version of Seven strips away the music to focus the message. 

Then there's Giant Taylor, who I think represents her queer coding inner child screaming to be seen &amp; heard. In Miss Americana she suggests that she was ""frozen at the age she became famous"" and [during Anti Hero](https://studio.youtube.com/video/ED8ElkrDfuA/edit) she screams, waves for attention and throws a very childlike tantrum when no one can hear her.

In the music video it's less obvious, but she wants to fit in with the (queer coded) dinner party, crawls in and sits on the floor, reacts with mute shock when she's shot with the arrow and then clumsily makes a mess when she tries to hide her ✨Midnight Blue✨ glitter blood.

"I know the album is yet to release, but seeing as it's coming out in a little over a week (and two singles have been released), I am wondering what everyone's thoughts are about the era so far, particularly in comparison to her first. Sophomore eras for me, are often the definitive era that helps us determine whether an artist's success was a fluke (such as Roddy Ricch) or whether they're here to stay for a while longer (such as Dua Lipa). Personally, as someone who loved Rodrigo's first era and album, I'm a little underwhelmed and confused by the Guts era so far. 

Though I don't expect artists to necessarily switch up their sound and entire aesthetic as early as their second era, I was surprised at just how similar the presentation of the Guts cover is, as it essentially looks like an outtake from the Sour promo. As for the music itself, I was personally underwhelmed by Vampire, and it hasn't performed as the huge hit that might be expected from the return of one of Gen Z's biggest stars. However, the biggest surprise for me was the choice of bad idea, right? as the second single. I think it's an incredible song, but from a moment I heard it - like many others, I was a little confounded by the decision to choose this as a lead single, as it's a little all over the place and isn't as easily accessible as I feel a single from a mainstream artist should be. To no surprise, the song is currently at no. 23 on the charts.

I'm still excited for the album, and I'm still expecting to enjoy it, but so far, it doesn't seem poised as the album that will continue to establish Rodrigo as a mainstay. I don't think it will be anywhere near as destructive as Roddy Ricch's second album, but I've been surprised at the relatively low impact of the singles, and both songs (in their own ways) haven't been great choices for singles. What are your thoughts?

"Following recent events….has your opinion on Taylor’s queerness changed at all? If I hadn’t gone deep down the rabbit hole and seen the absolute mountain of “evidence” spanning over a decade that she is queer, I’d be pretty convinced that she’s straight after today. However, I’m failing to see a likely explanation for all of it if she is indeed straight. It seems there are literally only two possible explanations for everything we have seen if she is actually heterosexual. The first being that she is THE biggest queer baiter to ever exist. I don’t see the reason for this, especially 10 years ago when people were a lot more homophobic and she didn’t really have anything to gain from it. She is also friends with and has worked with numerous actual queer people and I find it hard to believe that that many queer people would want anything to do with a straight woman who is the biggest queer baiter on the planet. The second explanation is that she and everyone around her are just extremely ignorant and were unaware of the queer references. This again I find hard to believe. Do we really think she’s just dumb? I could see it maybe being a case of coincidence or ignorance if we were talking about only a couple of things, but the entire mountain? It’s just too unlikely.

"guys I’ve been thinking about this relationship and I’m starting to notice some patterns that may indicate they are not actually dating and my theory is that taylor is using this relationship to draw away attention from the fact that she may be dating a woman, and I think that woman is rina yang

I started thinking about this when taylor posted that video of her showing ice spice’s outfit at the vma’s, at the beginning of the video rina yang can be seen looking at taylor and it looks like she’s kinda breathing her in really close to her neck, I think that’s too intimate for a friend to be doing especially considering she works for taylor (she’s taylor’s cinematographer)

I think that video was not supposed to be posted and it happened either because taylor posted it without tree knowing (she was drunk and I think the video was posted at ice spice’s stories so it was easier for them to post it without tree knowing) or tree allowed it to be posted thinking it was mainly focused on ice spice but it ended up drawing attention to the dynamic between taylor and rina

either way the video ended up on twitter and tumblr and I saw a lot of people talking about rina and taylor, so I think tree and taylor may have noticed it and they decided that it was better for her to get into a straight and very public relationship so people won’t have any doubt that the person she’s dating at the moment is a man and she’s not gay at all 

I know this theory is crazy but I started it because of an instagram story rina posted today in which she was referring to the vma’s video, she made a joke about her breathing on taylor and then said thanks to her friends and agents for reminding her that “the video is doing the rounds”, so she is aware that people on the internet are talking about it and it looks like it’s important enough that her agents are worried about it even weeks after the video was posted, which I find kinda weird if they are just friends

I’m gonna post a photo I took of the stories at the comments but I think it’s still available at rina’s instagram

"Both the enneagram and Taylor Swift are hyper-fixations of mine, and in another thread I mentioned that The Lakes is my Enneagram 4 song (I'm a 4). My reasoning comes from the lines ""those Windermere peaks look like the perfect place to cry,"" ""I want auroras and sad prose,"" ""I don't belong, and my beloved neither do you,"" as well as the general feel of the song. 

4s tend to over-identify with their sadness, and in my case at least, feed into it with sad music, books, etc. I am always looking for good places to cry and craving sad prose. 😂 In addition, 4s tend to feel like they don't belong, and crave being unique as a way to feel appreciated for who they are. 

So, what is the song you think best represents your enneagram number?

"These two records are the closest to her newer albums than the last 3 re-records.

If you’re like me, I’ve struggled to latch on to the re-records because they just don’t hit in the same way the originals did, and that’s okay. It’s not morally bad thing to prefer the originals and just because there’s a bunch of drama tied to them doesn’t mean we should fear, hate or forbid them. Most of us grew up with these records. Fearless released as I started high school, that little country girl meant something to me.

I own all of her original albums, purchased then usually at the time of release and don’t rely on streaming her old music which is where the revenue would come from. Morally I feel okay listening to the older ones knowing no money is going towards the person/people who bought them. But I digress…

When they were made her voice wasn’t as mature as it is now. However 1989, and even more noticeable, Reputation are both recorded with her maturer voice. While Taylor has done an excellent job vocally trying to replicate her younger voice, you’ll have a hard time distinguishing them apart when she does release them.

I recently was contacted by someone (I think a scammer, it was a sketch conversation) regarding a post I had made to buy one Eras ticket in Seattle. The seller offered them for $1400 and they were section 3 (nosebleeds) with a significantly obstructed view. I politely said no and that it was more than I'd decided to spend. 

The seller then went off lol, ""you're not a real Swiftie,"" ""You don't deserve to go,"" etc. 😂 What the heck?!

"Which do you think are the top 5 defining moments and highlights of TS' career so far?

My thoughts:

1. Fearless - rise to mainstream prominence, AOTY win, VMAs (pop culture moment that established her as a household name)
2. 1989 - commercial peak, AOTY win; established herself as a pop titan during this era
3. Folklore/Evermore - artistic peak, AOTY win; widespread critical acclaim and established herself as an artist in the eyes of the media and general public
4. Re-recordings - absolute BOSS move that won her extensive media coverage and public goodwill. also instrumental in building up the momentum for Taylormania. ATV10M video became a pop culture moment.

"My question: Did anybody download Super shy to their device on the same day it was realised? If you did, I would absolutely love it if you could somehow upload it somewhere or something so that I could access download that version for myself. 

Okay I’m gonna sound crazy, but I came across a Super shy Tiktok audio tonight which sounded really pretty and I couldn’t tell why it sounded so unfamiliar despite the fact that I listen to super shy several times a week. I realised that it’s because on the day super shy dropped, half of hanni’s vocals were completely different to what’s currently in the YT video + Spotify track today. 

Go to 1:33 on the official M/V where it’s hanni’s line “you don’t even know my name do ya” and compare what you hear to the same section of the MV in the following reaction video (the URL is already time stamped at the right spot) - this is one of the only YT videos I could find where the person had reacted to the very original version of the song hence the OG vocals: 

https://youtu.be/WSh0_LAmZV4?t=149

Does anyone else hear how much breathier and softer the OG vocals were at that part ?!?!?! I find it so much nicer sounding than the current version. 

SO. 

I would love to have a copy of that original version so that I can listen to that one from time to time instead! If you listen carefully, you’ll find there are a lot of other sections that are also dissimilar to the current version. 

Thank you so much. Also please let me know if you know *why* they even changed it in the first place",https://www.reddit.com/r/NewJeans/comments/165fikd/did_anyone_download_super_shy_immediately_after/,Did anyone download Super shy IMMEDIATELY after it’s release? **desperate**,NewJeans,t3_165fikd,/r/NewJeans/comments/165fikd/did_anyone_download_super_shy_immediately_after/,2023-08-30 13:58:51,New Jeans,0.19314334

" So I was never a “late stage Kaylor” I figured they broke up around the lover era and would never get back together (like ever.) But here we are. I think they’ve actually been back together for a minute now. Sometime before Midnights came out for sure. 

On its face yes, Midnights is a break album, but is that all it is? I don’t really think so. Labyrinth is the song that I think provides the most evidence that she went through a breakup but reunited with someone. She sings about the heartbreak she experienced but talks about the plane “turning around” and her “falling in love again.” Also I went back to watch the Midnights Mayhem with me videos and before she announced this she said it would be worth the wait. Hmmm interesting… 

There are definitely more hints at this on the album such as Snow on the Beach. She’s amazed that the person she wants wants her back, possibly because they are exes? I think Maroon definitely hints at a brief reunion with an ex.

The Great War says, “You Drew Up Some Good Faith Treaties, I Drew Curtains Closed.” I believe Karlie was likely trying to work things out. I think a big reason Karlie and Taylor ended was Karlie’s marriage. Originally, I thought this was because of Josh, but now I think it was more likely Taylor’s doing. She wanted to be chosen over Josh. The Great War is so telling and she literally says “I really thought I’d lost you.” Come on.. 

I believe Paris is just a fantasy she has about her and Karlie just blocking out all of the noise and running away from it. “Not the kind that’s thrown I mean the kind under where a tree has grown” to me this line still says so much. She never meant the shade that was thrown. She meant that the shade from her PR (Tree) never made her less gay. 

I think High Infidelity isn’t about Taylor, it’s about Karlie. Karlie and Princess Beatrice who she was with during her trip to Jordan. 

Glitch is another song that feels very much to me like she’s surprised the person she wants wants her back. (Also can we admit that glitch makes no sense if she supposed to be with Joe at the time?) They were supposed to be over but they hooked up and now she’s fastening herself to Karlie with a stitch. 

You’re losing me is the biggest key to the puzzle. I think this breakup took place over the span of a decent chunk of time. They probably got back together around the end of 2021/ beginning of 2022 around when this song was written. She probably wrote this song when they were talking about getting back together. She still wanted Karlie to choose her over Josh. To leave Josh for her. “Risk something “lose something” she wanted her to stop trying to have both sides. “Fighting in only your army,” she didn’t have any one else she was with. She was monogamous to Karlie. This song isn’t such a heartbreak, hopeless song, it’s an ultimatum. I think Taylor initially didn’t want to get back with her unless she left Josh, but ultimately decided she’d rather be with her while she’s with Josh than lose her all together. 

The exile ends “3 days” thing is crazy and really makes me think this is true. I have thought since midnights came out that we were missing something and as eras continued it just seemed to get more and more confusing but I really think this could be the piece we’ve been overlooking. They’re back together. I think Karlie and Josh are still together and they’re doing fine, but I don’t think they’re monogamous and tbh I never have thought that. 

How does Travis Kelce fit into all of this? I don’t know. Maybe a beard, maybe polygamy? I really don’t know about the Travis Kelce of it all. But I do think Karlie and Taylor are back on.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GaylorSwift/comments/188btdr/is_kaylor_back_on/,Is Kaylor back on?,GaylorSwift,t3_188btdr,/r/GaylorSwift/comments/188btdr/is_kaylor_back_on/,2023-12-01 13:26:26,Taylor Swift,0.13561769

"Hello, welcome back to another round of ""Maybe We Got Lost in Translation""! This is a game where Taylor Swift’s lyrics are translated over and over into different languages until they get messed up and the players must correctly guess from which songs these lyrics belong to. Have fun! :D

# How to Play:

The game consists of 13 rounds, each with 3 different hyper-translated lyrics that you must identify (3 plays). For each play, up to 3 guesses can be made about which song that snippet belongs to. Getting the song right on the first guess is worth more points than on the second or third tries, so put your most accurate guess first. In case you miss the 3 guesses, there is still the “album extra guess”, where you can get extra points if you correctly guess the album in which the snippet is on. The guesses will be made on Google Forms and the answers of a round and the users’ scores are always revealed in the next one.

# Additional Information:

1. New rounds will be posted every 2 days at noon (Washington DC time zone), and if one day I end up not posting the round then it will be postponed to the next day.
2. “Album extra guess” is kinda like a ""last chance"", so these points will only be counted for the players who missed the 3 initial song guesses.
3. The only required fields on Google Forms are the 1st guess and the “album extra guess”, so it is not necessary to make 3 guesses if you don’t want to, although it is recommended (as it increases your chances of earning points).
4. I don’t know much about how things work on Reddit and also English isn’t my first language, so if I make any mistakes or grammatical errors let me know. :)

# Rounds &amp; Scoring:

The 13 rounds are divided into 4 levels of difficulty:

* **Easy (text translated 10x):** rounds 1, 2 and 3.
* **Medium (text translated 30x):** rounds 4, 5, 6 and 7.
* **Hard (text translated 50x):** rounds 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12.
* **Extreme (text translated 100x):** round 13.

# Last Round Answers:

**1st play:** the correct answer was **Mine**, from the album Speak Now.

* *Travel around the world / I work with you in the office / You know my secret, you know why I keep it. / You say we should not act like our ancestors.*
* *Flash forward and we're takin' on the world together* */* *And there's a drawer of my things at your place* */ You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded / You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes*

**2nd play:** the correct answer was **Better Man**, from the album Red.

* *i'm proud now / I gave everything. / We all know there's nothing to say.*
* *I hold onto this pride because these days it's all I have /* *And I gave to you my best* */ And we both know you can't say that*

**3rd play:** the correct answer was **Love Story**, from the album Fearless.

* *I will take you to the park / If they know we're dead, they'll be quiet / Close your eyes / They are all out of town*
* *So I sneak out to the garden to see you* */ We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew / So close your eyes / Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh*

**/!\\ Warning:** last round I received two submissions from the ""same player"", but the second responses were completely different from the first ones; I contacted the player and found out that they were not the one who sent the second submission. So this warning is really just to ask that you guys please do not try to ""cheat"" another player's score (and also because I can easily see who sent which answer from the patterns) and to remember that this is just a game and the scoreboard has no use other than being a fun tool to motivate people to play the game. Having said that, thanks for playing the game and have fun with this round!

"Disclaimer: this is only really geared toward the people who are exclusively switching to Taylor’s Versions as they come out. 

The Pop Goes Punk version of Blank Space (by I Prevail) came on shuffle today and I realized that when they were made, Taylor was still under Big Machine and I didn’t know if we have come to a consensus about covers that were released during the Big Machine time period. Does anyone know the ethical ramifications of covers from that time frame?

"My thoughts:

Taylor is known for changing her setlist for different legs of her tours, depending on the feedback from the fans, and the availability of the guests.

The release of tracks from the vault and the likely release of Reputation (Taylor's Version) in early 2024 might affect the setlist for the European leg of the Eras Tour in several ways. For example:

- She might perform some of the vault tracks from 1989 (Taylor's Version), such as ""Slut!"" or ""Is It Over Now?"", which were not included in the US leg of the tour.
- She might add some songs from Reputation (Taylor's Version) that were not performed in the US leg of the tour, such as ""Dress"" or ""New Year's Day"", which are fan favourites.
- She might invite some guest artists who collaborated with her on the vault tracks or Reputation (Taylor's Version), such as Ed Sheeran, and of course Hayley Williams, to join her on stage for some special performances (I clowned hard about this one on the last night of her US leg, thinking Ed Sheeran would join her on stage and Reputation (Taylor's Version) was going to be dropped 🤡)

Of course, these are just some possibilities. Taylor might have other plans for her setlist that we don't know yet. But I'm sure that whatever she decides to do, it will be amazing ❤🩷💙💜🤎🖤

"The Old Guy remembers when ""Cruel Summer"" was a Bananarama song. Taylor did not write it because she was not born yet. Peaked at #9 in 1984. It was a bop.

Ace Of Base remade it in 1998 and hit #10 but did not improve on the original.

When Lover was released Taylor's Cruel Summer peaked at 29, so Bananarama still held the crown. But with the recent surge in popularity, Taylor's Cruel Summer is now the biggest Cruel Summer.

"So as you all know, Billie Eilish [officially] [came out yesterday](https://youtu.be/cff-ij1Mf64?si=iCDqhJVGaa5RI7CC). Go watch it, we already have discussed this on the sub, but today I wanted to focus on the public's response and aftermath, and how it can give a perspective to the chaos around a potential CO for other queer women like Taylor.

Three tweets that really stood out for me. First came a few months ago, where Billie called herself ""fruity"". Many people picked up on it 
(I mean, how could you not?) and OP essentially said she did a soft lunch CO. Someone qrted it, and basically said, *no she's straight*, garnering over 60K likes. This is really interesting in conjunction with tweet #2 where this person is claiming it is queer people who forced her out. So this narrative people are trying to pull that it is some jobless queers such as ourselves who are ""forcing"" women out of the closet, while also these same people refused to listen to her when she said it was obvious. *Is it us who are forcing queer people out of the closet, or is it you who is trying so desperately to keep them in? Who is the real enemy here?*

Then lastly the third tweet, which at first sounds like a classic case of biphobia (which could very well be the case) but to me sounds more of a lack of knowledge to the possibility of bearding and the reality that if Billie had relationships with women, they would not be public and we wouldn't know about them because she *just* came out (also, ntm, she is only 21 lol). This just made me sad, because if Taylor were to CO, would she get a similar reaction? She has only dated men publicly, so would she get called an attention seeker if she came out as bi? A common anti-Gaylor rhetoric is ""if Taylor was gay, why wouldn't she just come out???""...when the answers are right there. The above examples are all written by queer people, so she would not only get criticism from homophobics but also the heteronormative minds of other LGBT+ individuals as well.",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/18a7foe,Billie Eilish and the Reality of Queer Women in Hollywood,GaylorSwift,t3_18a7foe,/r/GaylorSwift/comments/18a7foe/billie_eilish_and_the_reality_of_queer_women_in/,2023-12-04 00:10:25,Taylor Swift,0.27412915

"Okay this might sound hella lame, but I'm genuinely curious. I'm a business guy. I see big artists and can't help but to think of their music as the product they're selling. What value does Billie bring to you as a consumer?

The thing is, you can't have a successful product without providing value. People like Billie are literal MILLIONAIRES off of the music. What's so valuable about it? Like, I think her music is good, but what makes it VALUABLE? Worth money? What about her music brings so many people to her shows? From a boringly business perspective, what about Billie's music is a valuable asset in the economy worth throwing money at her for?

In business, you make money by solving problems. The more difficult a problem is, the more value you'll provide by solving it. But music and popular art in general seems like an exception to this rule. What problem does music solve for the consumer? Do you think Billie, and all other big artists, deserve the amount of wealth they've generated from their music?

This has been on my mind heavy. Prolly gonna make a similar post on other artists I enjoys subs to see if the answers have common threads.

Non-album singles, leaked songs etc. are all allowed. You can specify which version you prefer when it comes to T**aylor's Version** of the songs but **they can't appear twice** on your list.

For example, you can't put both This Love and This Love (Taylor's Version) on your list. Doing so would make your list ineligible, as Taylor's Version and the original versions of the songs' scores will be combined in the final results (and that would mean you'd be voting for the same song twice :) ).

---

**Please read the guidelines below if you haven't participated in TTPT before:**

1. Comment below your top **ten** tracks from the featured artist(s) **in order.** Please write the song names correctly, that would help me a lot while calculating the results. **If you have comments for songs, leave them before or after your list.**
2. Your list should be written [exactly like this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/500805575920058379/771686626467774494/unknown.png) if you want it to be included in the results.
3. **Keep in mind that the program reads the comment how you write it, not how we see it.** Don't put full stops or commas after the song names. ""Don't put quote marks around them,"" **don't** *style* ~~them.~~ [Do NOT do this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/500805575920058379/771682314693378048/unknown.png), please. I won't correct any formatting mistakes manually.
4. The songs in your list gets 10 to 1 points based on its rank. The first song gets 10 points, and the last one gets 1\. The results are revealed at the same time as the next TTPT is posted.

"I was flabbergasted to find that a big part of the fandom does not enjoy End Game. I on the other hand LOVE it, the flow is amazing and it's just so goddamn fun to sing along to.

I'm one of the swifties' who have decided not to stream any albums Taylor does not own yet so I haven't heard the album version of End Game in a long, LONG time and boy do I miss it. I watch or rather listen to the reputation stadium tour at least once a month and Taylor's solo version of the song just doesn't scratch my brain the same way the original does so I've been really taken aback by people actually preferring the tour version. To me the song just seems incomplete without Ed Sheeran and Future's verses. The deliverance... MWAH.

Then again, I've also noticed a lot of people bashing on Sheeran in general which I cannot begin to understand 'cause I myself have been a fan of his for a decade. Also, around the time reputation was released I'd been diving deeper into rap music so the song was kind of like a perfect mixture of Taylor, Ed and rap/hiphop. Worlds colliding, mind blowing type of a moment for me lol.

ANYWAY, I just wanted to publicly appreciate the gem that is End Game and also find others who enjoy it as much as I do ⭐",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/104eh9x/end_game_appreciation/,End Game appreciation,TaylorSwift,t3_104eh9x,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/104eh9x/end_game_appreciation/,2023-01-05 23:52:40,Taylor Swift,0.3811502

My main question is how come it's like this in NJ..As far as I know all the girls are promoted equally and have their fair share of screen time in songs so how come it seems Hanni and Haerin have more fans as compared to the others?
Even in fancam views, I realized after their first comeback (Omg and Dito)there's been a huge difference in fancam views between Haerin and hanni and the rest of them members..the rest of the them barely crack 500k as compared to kittyz

"Okay, it's not a new theory or even that exciting, I just have been struggling to make the Kaylor timeline make sense in my head, and I think I've figured out what I think happened.

So, I agree with the people who think that Rep is about Karlie, and Taylor and Karlie broke up sometime in between Rep and Lover. Lover is actually a breakup album in disguise. I think Taylor planned to make Lover her coming out album, and she wanted Karlie to come out with her, and maybe even wanted to take it further and get married. But Karlie, who was with that Kushner (idk if I really think it's a bearding situation or not, but I think it's more than likely contractual than love between them), wasn't as all in. I think that Kushner ultimately decided he stood to benefit more if Karlie married him and stayed in the closet, and in the end, that's what she chose (hence, Taylor saying, ""I wouldn't marry me either,"" ""lose something, babe, risk something,"" etc.).

I think Joe and Taylor initially were going to be each other's beards; I think they're both bi. But when things with Karlie fell apart, I think Joe developed feelings for Taylor, and I think she started to reciprocate. That wasn't part of the initial plan, but there was always the potential for attraction between them, and it happened (""we were supposed to be just friends""). But I think Joe always had stronger feelings for Taylor than she did for him, and of course, she hadn't really fully gotten over Karlie (and maybe still hasn't). I think she always sort of held Joe at arm's distance (think Afterglow-style). And when Joe wanted to take things further, maybe even get married, she realized that wasn't really what she wanted (Lavender Haze, Champagne Problems, etc etc). And maybe she has rekindled things with Karlie - I'm not really fully on board with LSK, but who knows. And we all know that Taylor is not above cheating. And I think there might actually be a kernel of truth in the narrative that Joe couldn't handle her level of fame. So, for a lot of reasons, I think things between Taylor and Joe didn't work out because they were doomed from the start. It was never supposed to be real anyway.

Thanks for reading this if you did, it's not a big insight or anything I just kind of wanted to sort out my thoughts here and see what y'all think as well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Gaylor_Swift/comments/13wzgxy/wake_up_babe_new_gaylor_theory_just_dropped/,"Wake up, babe, new Gaylor theory just dropped",Gaylor_Swift,t3_13wzgxy,/r/Gaylor_Swift/comments/13wzgxy/wake_up_babe_new_gaylor_theory_just_dropped/,2023-05-31 21:59:32,Taylor Swift,0.11067997
"(This is not a discuss about why their relationship would end or speculation about their personal decisions.)

Personally, I think think they are very happy together! I only ask this question because of the insane fall-out that would likely ensue if they were to break up. I found myself asking this question after I stumbled upon an old article about her and HS. The article itself was incredibly gushy and the comments on the post from “swifties” were nothing but positive and supportive. 

After they broke up I remember swifties literally threatening HS fans and HS. H was enemy 1# for a few solid years, as were (and are) many of her ex’s post break up, even though what we know about these relationships is so little. 

So with that said, what will the reaction be from swifties if/when her and J break up? They have written songs together, won Grammys “together”, been with each other for almost a decade, and many of Taylor’s songs (that are from a personal perspective) from the past 5 years seem to be about him. 

Will swifties all turn on him? Will they blame him for the breakup? I can only imagine how awful it could be. Some people are STILL nasty to JG and JM (and those relationships were over 10 years ago. Not defending JG or JM, but it’s ridiculous that people still send hate their way.).

Again, what Taylor does with her life doesn’t concern me. She seems really happy, but I don’t care who she’s with / not with. I don’t think people should send hate to anyone, especially when we only know a sliver of the full story from a biased perspective. 

I’d love to hear what you think will/would happen and how they reaction from this sub and other swifties would be.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/11saeqz/what_happens_ifwhen_taylor_and_joe_breakup/,What Happens If/When Taylor and Joe Breakup?,TaylorSwift,t3_11saeqz,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/11saeqz/what_happens_ifwhen_taylor_and_joe_breakup/,2023-03-15 21:47:26,Taylor Swift,0.08953904

"of ‘bad idea right?’

Like, they just randomly announce it a couple of days before it releases. They release it local time, which in some ways is a cool gesture for international fans, but also leads to the song getting leaked in the US. And then despite this talk of a premiere watch party at 8PM/11PM from Livies HQ, I didn’t really see pomp and circumstance before the video came out? And while 1.5 mil in 10 hours on the video is obviously nothing to sneeze at, it feels like the video might be even bigger if it had more promotion. Although, there’s also the fact that this song is more experimental, which I’m not against, but that doesn’t always lead to chart success and…Idk. There are just so many people who hate on Liv—it feels like a single not performing well right now would just give them so much ammo. But maybe this single is the ‘deja vu’ of the line up and another one is coming on August 25th after all?

"I recently made a thread about the background history of 1989 and quite a few people asked me to do other albums and lyrical breakdowns so, here we go!  I'm starting with this song because it's so rich with imagery, there's a lot to take from such illustrious lyrics. If this seems ""easy"" to you, please don't complain. Not everyone speaks English as a first language and some don't really take lyrics into account when listening to music, so this breakdown is more for those types of listeners!

Before I start, a few interesting points:

* The title is what World War I was referred to before World War II happened. In this instance, the term represents a time of serious fighting in a relationship. It's not the first time Taylor's used war imagery to describe her troubled relationships. The other most prominent one would be ""I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight"" in All Too Well 10. This signifies that when Taylor fights, she fights *hard*. War imagery was also used in Epiphany to compare frontline soldiers with frontline medical staff during covid.
* The lyric video shows a [white flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_flag). This flag signifies surrender in wars. Once that flag is flown, that side has forfeited or admitted defeat. They no longer want to fight (or believe they can win).
* The drums used in the instrumentation mimic drums often used in military or army ceremonies, something like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9nmSJ3gesE).
* The fight seems to be one she and Joe had around 2018, with a significant fallout period. It does appear to be the same fight she unpacks in Afterglow, and could be the one referenced in Me! (""I know that I went psycho on the phone/I never leave well enough alone""/the fight the whole music video is based around, where Brendon is aloof and unresponsive while Taylor is embarrassed and enraged), in the Lover music video (she sees him talking to ""her"" and they argue/take time apart - interesting to note in both Me and Lover videos, the man goes to *her* to make amends). False God, Miss Americana and Daylight also reference fighting. Reputation makes no reference to any fighting.

**Lyrical Breakdown:**

***""My knuckles were bruised like violets""***

The vivid imagery begins instantly. Taylor's hand is injured. That by itself, with no context, grabs your attention and makes you wonder. What happened? Is she ok? She describes the injury using flower imagery, violet being both a purple color and a type of flower. Contrasting the relatively light imagery of flowers with the brutality of a violent injury is attention grabbing. The use of ""were"" places this story in the past.

""***Sucker punching walls, cursed you as I sleep-talked""***

The injury to her hand was self caused, and throughout the song she owns a lot of her actions made in anger. The term ""sucker punch"" means to suddenly punch someone/something without warning or provocation. Which plays into the ""I reacted wrong"" theme of the song. Now, a ""you"" is introduced as the reason for the violent outbursts, someone angering her even as she sleeps. Taylor having difficulty sleeping is prevalent through her entire body of work, and sleep talking has come up a few times. In Would've Could've Should've, she notes ""I fight with you in my sleep"".

""***Spineless in my tomb of silence""***

Spineless is a term used for cowardly people who do not make honourable or brave decisions. A tomb is typically where the dead are buried deep underground. Her ""underground"" is her silence, she is not communicating, she is running away from communication/confrontation. Using silence (or perhaps silent *treatment*) is addressed on Afterglow: ""Punished you with silence"". Burying herself is also referenced in her YouTube Short for Anti Hero where she says she often self isolates. Again, in Afterglow: ""I lived like an island"".

***""Tore your banners down, took the battle underground""***

Banners are often displayed in military/army type ceremonies as well, or when a political leader makes a speech/appearance. Taylor reinforces the previous lines: she is in destruction mode and she is hiding herself. An underground battle means the opponent does not know what the next ""move"" will be, making it near impossible to know what to do. There is another link to Would've, Could've, Should've: ""Years of tearing down our banners, you and I"". It's hard to say whether this is just imagery Taylor liked or whether the rage of Would've Could've felt equivalent to the rage she felt here.

""***And maybe it was egos swinging/Maybe it was her""***

Now Taylor begins to consider why her anger has blown up so catastrophically, and also gives listeners some clarity as to how the fight could've begun. Ego is sense of self importance or esteem. Embarrassment is often referred to as ""a bruised ego"" because someone doing something to humiliate us can make us feel insecure/ashamed. Taylor reasons that perhaps both their sense of pride or importance were fighting (to ""take a swing"" at someone is to try to hit them). The conflict was prolonged by neither one willing to forfeit, ""lose"" the fight, or apologise. Then we are introduced to a third party - a ""her"". Jealousy and miscommunication, or pre-existing history with exes is a popular cause for fights between couples. There is a ""her"" in the Lover music video and throughout Reputation, Taylor is very aware of ""the other girls"". As we recently found out, she built an entire song around the concept of ""All Of The Girls You Loved Before"". But the use of ""maybe"" for both reasons indicates Taylor isn't 100% sure if either of these factors was the reason they fell out this bad.

""***Flashes of the battle come back to me in a blur""***

Another explanation for the ""maybes"" is that perhaps so much time has passed that she doesn't remember how the fight began, or that, once something angers her, she gets into such a state that she sort of ""blacks out"" and can't recall her actions in the moment. This feels similar to ""My words shoot to kill when I'm mad, I have a lot of regrets about that"" in This Is Me Trying and ""I wish we could go back and remember what we were fighting for"" in I Wish You Would.

""***All that bloodshed, crimson clover""***

Once again, violent imagery of bloodshed is contrasted with a flower, this time the [crimson clover.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trifolium_incarnatum) It's worth noting that the first verse really had to spell out the violence as rage spilling out of her due to a fallout, for the listener to not be too alarmed. We know by the time the chorus hits that she is not referring to a literal physical fight.

""***Uh-huh, sweet dream was over""***

The [honeymoon phase](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/what-is-the-honeymoon-phase/) of their relationship feels over, because they are in a terrible fight.

***""My hand was the one you reached for""***

His first move was trying to mend the pain through touch. He reached out, while she pulled away. This could also link to False God's attempt to make amends after a fight through physical...*communication* when they ""can't talk to \[each other\] when you're like this"".

***All throughout the Great War/Always remember***

Remembering is a common trope throughout Taylor's work. The act of remembering solidifies the event as real (""I was there, I remember it"") and remembrance serves as a lesson, something to look back on as you move forward.

*""****Uh-huh, tears on the letter""***

Possible link to the physical touch, they are still not communicating verbally (or able to talk about the fight yet) so a letter was written to try to unpack things in a different way. Perhaps talk kept leading to arguments, so they tried alternate methods.

***""I vowed not to cry anymore/******If we survived the Great War""***

A vow is a promise. This line gives me pause as crying is not exactly an issue, nor is it a problem a relationship can't handle. Crying is a *reaction*. Why can't she cry *anymore*?

***""You drew up some good faith treaties""***

Treaties are official agreements, usually between countries or states, vowing to keep the peace or follow a set of rules. So her partner wants to solidify some sort of agreement where, it seems, she has to try not to view his actions in bad faith. He feels he is trustworthy and her anger is undeserved.

***""I drew curtains closed, drank my poison all alone""***

She is still self isolating and drinking alcohol as a coping mechanism. She draws contrast between her rather toxic, self destructive habits and his more positive attempts to make peace.

***""You said I have to trust more freely""***

She cannot trust without evidence that she *should* trust, meaning she perhaps had no evidence in regards to whatever caused their fight, but *that* was also probably what triggered her, the ""maybe"" of it all. Maybe it was her, maybe it wasn't. But what if it *was*? That thought process can indeed send someone spiraling. It's worth considering that the extremely famous and extremely *mistreated* Taylor Swift has every reason to not trust people freely. But it's also no way to live.

***""But diesel is desire, you were playin' with fire""***

Some interesting imagery here to describe what set her off. Diesel is a type of gas and gas can trigger a fire. *Playing with fire* means someone comes very close to injury, or in this case hurting someone they love. So whatever he did, he came *close* to crossing her line. The fact that he only came close though, might play into the lack of evidence I referred to above, where it could've l*ooked like* he was doing something wrong but he had no ill intentions, and she just has to believe him. Again, I come back to the ""her"" in the Lover video. A man *can* just talk and laugh with a woman and not mean anything by it. But what if? I tend to think this ""what if"" is what set Taylor off and why Joe was so blindsided/asking her to trust him.

***""And maybe it's the past that's talking/Screaming from the crypt""***

She still tries to find a reason for her anger/the fight. She questions whether her own past experiences with exes is coloring her reaction now. What we've been through can make us think it's happening again, if we see someone presently acting the way a previous ex did, in a way that caused damage. The production here literally illustrates what she's describing as a background vocal screams from the crypt. A crypt is another type of tomb. Whatever triggered her is long dead, but still haunting her. Again I'm reminded of Would've Could've Should've: ""The tomb won't close"".

***""Tellin' me to punish you for things you never did/So I justified it""***

This is the first line where she seems to conclude he *didn't* do what she thought.

***""All that bloodshed, crimson clover/Uh-huh, the bombs were close""...****""****Always remember/Uh-huh, the burning embers""***

More war related imagery, this time the ""bombs"" being set off are coming closer and there is burnt destruction around them, meaning the fight probably got worse before it got better.

**""I vowed not to fight anymore/If we survived the Great War""**

Again, the conditional resolution centers around her not reacting in a certain way...

**""It turned into something bigger/Somewhere in the haze, got a sense I'd been betrayed""**

The ""haze"" could literally refer to their lavender haze (honeymoon phase), but also the haze of war zones as the destruction dies down. Taylor names her feeling: she feels betrayed. If betrayal was the issue, because of a “her”, well, you can put two and two together.

***""Your finger on my hair pin trigger""***

She reinforces that he did almost do the worst he could’ve done to set her off. His finger was on the trigger, she doesn't say he pushed it. She re-appropriates hair trigger to ""hair pin trigger"", probably to link to the poppy/hair line later on. I'm also curious if this is in reference to ""You could hear a hair pin drop"" in Right Where You Left Me, also about a traumatic incident with an ex that left her feeling stuck in time.

***""Soldier down on that icy ground/Looked up at me with honor and truth""***

She paints a picture of Joe as a hurt/wounded soldier beaten down with nothing left to defend himself. Except for his true character displayed throughout. She realises she *could* actually trust him, that he was so wrecked and defeated from trying to regain trust, that he must’ve been truthful all along.

***""Broken and blue, so I called off the troops""***

More Afterglow similarities: ""I blew things out of proportion, now you're blue""

***""That was the night I nearly lost you/I really thought I lost you""***

In war imagery, this would signify death. Considering she would later use death/sickness imagery in You're Losing Me as a representation of emotional neglect, I think in this instance, he probably almost left after trying so hard to repair damage he may not have even done.

***""We can plant a memory garden/Say a solemn prayer, place a poppy in my hair""***

The song moves to present tense as she considers how they can commemorate and learn from their war without repeating their mistakes. A memory garden, solemn prayers and poppies are ways society now remembers and commemorates soldiers who fought in wars. Specifically Remembrance Day where many people wear a single poppy as a sign of respect.

***""There's no morning glory, it was war, it wasn't fair""***

Hindsight, lesson learned, realizing mistakes, no one can really know all of someone else's triggers by default, sometimes we don't fully know our own until we are triggered. The term ""morning glory"" also carries several connotations to war.

***""Always remember/Uh-huh, we're burned for better""***

They are wounded and changed but ultimately came out stronger as a result.

***""I vowed I would always be yours""***

Taylor repeats this vow three times, but again I wonder: what did ***he*** vow?",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/15w1fcs/deep_lyrical_breakdown_the_great_war/,Deep Lyrical Breakdown: The Great War,TaylorSwift,t3_15w1fcs,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/15w1fcs/deep_lyrical_breakdown_the_great_war/,2023-08-20 04:31:20,Taylor Swift,0.15766735

This actually started as [an exercise](https://www.reddit.com/r/GaylorSwift/comments/zcpbjs/sunday_funday_prompt_whowhat_would_you_think/) in trying to connect “All Too Well” with a muse based solely on the lyrics and short film, **while ignoring all timelines, social media and paparazzi photos/PR**. Taylor has emphasized since the beginning of her career how important her lyrics are to her.

Although this definitely started as an analysis of the lyrics and short film for “All Too Well”, I must admit that after I picked up on some connections, “it grew into something bigger”. (So buckle up, because this is a long one.)

**A little bit of background information about Scarlett Johansson for those who are not very familiar:**

**Personal life:**

Scarlett was born and raised in New York. Her birthday is November 22, 1984 (**Sagittarius**). According to her wiki, she was very close to her **grandmother Dorothy.** She **went to high school with Jack Antonoff. They dated for about a year and attended prom together**. She **was married to Ryan Reynolds** from 2008-2011. She was married to French journalist Romain Dauriac from 2014-2017, they have a daughter together named Rose Dorothy. She is currently married to Colin Jost from SNL and they have a one year old son named Cosmo.

**FUN FACT: Did you know that Scarlett Johansson** [was the inspiration](https://people.com/celebrity/scarlett-johansson-is-flattered-she-inspired-i-kissed-a-girl/) **behind Katy Perry's song ""I Kissed a Girl?""**

**Career:**

**Acting:** She began her acting career at the age of 9. She is one of the world’s highest paid actresses and received the “American Cinematheque Award” for her achievements in the film industry (a real legacy). I will be referencing some of the projects she has appeared in throughout this post. Here's her [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlett_Johansson) page for a full list.

**Music:** She **has released two indie albums**. The first, a solo Tom Waits cover album titled *Anywhere I Lay My Head* (2008) and the second **a “duets” album** with Pete Yorn titled *Breakup* (2009). Pete Yorn and Scarlett also released a follow up EP in 2018 titled “Apart”. In 2015, **she formed a girl group with Este Haim**, Kendra Morris, Holly Miranda and Julia Haltigan (short lived because they received a “[cease and desist](https://pitchfork.com/news/58621-scarlett-johanssoneste-haim-band-the-singles-get-cease-and-desist-over-name/)” due to the band’s name already being taken).

**Modeling/Spokesmodeling:** Scarlett was the global brand ambassador and **the face of Moet and Chandon champagnes** from 2009-2012. She was also the brand ambassador and spokesmodel for Dolce and Gabbana’s **“The One”** and **“Rose The One”.**

**I am going to try to stick with comparing public work and not go into gossip/paparazzi/PR stuff too much. However, I do feel like I at least need to point out some things for nuance:**

* Taylor and Scarlett both attended the Met Gala in 2008

[Lover Diary Entry](https://preview.redd.it/uegwt0p9ghea1.png?width=1193&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0860454d881564e480dc90aa5d0a22763affa562)

* Taylor was first seen with Jake Gyllenhaal in October of 2010 (backstage at SNL, Emma stone was hosting). From what I could find online, all of the photos and sightings of them occurred within the span of a month (Oct.23-Nov.26, 2010). Their breakup was announced on January 4, 2011.
* It is possible that the PR with Jake was put in place to explain some of the songs on her next album.
* Scarlett and Ryan announced their divorce in December 2010. They were very private throughout their entire marriage, rarely seen together in public, and typically didn't attend events together.
* Theoretically, if Taylor and Scarlett became involved in some capacity while Scarlett was still married, it would have been an ""illicit affair"", with Taylor being the other woman.
* Taylor **seemed to confirm the theory that the ""actress asking what happened"" in ATW was Anne Hathaway by releasing the short film on her birthday** (Nov. 12). I have seen theories that the party she is referring to in the song is the Vanity Fair Oscars party which took place in February of 2011 (according to the Lover diaries, the first draft of ATW was written in February, 2011). Taylor, Anne and Jake were all in attendance that night. However, Scarlett was also there ([in a maroon dress](https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/photo-gallery/32080237/image/34254704/Scarlett-Johansson-Vanity-Fair-Oscar-Party-2011)).

*(****I am going to begin with All Too Well****, since that is what sent me down this rabbit hole in the first place.)*

""I walked through the door with you, The air was cold. But something about it felt like home somehow""

* The title track of Scarlett’s debut album: *Anywhere I Lay My Head* (written by Tom Waits): *“And* ***the wind is blowing cold***. Well, I don't need anybody. Because I learned, I learned to be alone. Well, I said anywhere, anywhere, ***anywhere I lay my head, well, I'm gonna call my home***”

""We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate.""

* Scarlett starred in the video for Bob Dylan’s song “When the Deal Goes Down”, which **takes place in upstate New York**. It includes a scene where Scarlett is riding in the passenger’s seat of a **vintage red convertible**. I encourage you to [watch the video](https://youtu.be/CEoGqUqy-0w), the entire aesthetic is very “Red era”.

https://preview.redd.it/xjeg5y6dghea1.png?width=1548&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6264de8f33ea3c3dcd83f42ce6e7aac2ca955438

[Hand to God this is Scarlett in a boat and not Taylor.](https://preview.redd.it/wvor3t2gghea1.png?width=1557&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5177a45e5bf8905fa844d5d5fbbb8fffeafd797d)

“Autumn leaves **falling down** like pieces into place and I can picture it after all these days”

* **""Falling Down”** was the lead single off of SJ’s debut album.
* ""No One Knows I'm Gone"" (Tom Waits, track 10 on SJ's album): ""***The leaves will bury every year*** *and no one knows I'm gone""*

“You used to be a little kid with glasses in a **twin-sized** bed”

* This could be a play on words because **Scarlett has a twin** [named Hunter](https://people.com/movies/scarlett-johansson-on-twin-brothers-charity-which-helps-first-responders-he-makes-me-better/).)

""And maybe we got **lost in translation""**

* Scarlett starred in the film *Lost in Translation*

""But maybe this thing was a **masterpiece** 'til you tore it all up

* Scarlett starred in *the Girl with a Pearl Earring,* playing the role of a literal masterpiece
* Taylor frequently wore pearl drop earrings during Red promo, often with only one earring exposed:

https://preview.redd.it/ynzib98mghea1.jpg?width=2400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c10ba7a9eb13e286e2e00f91928244e33a7fdfec

“And you call me up again just to break me like a promise”

* ""I Am the Cosmos"" from **Breakup**: ***“Just when I was starting to feel okay, You're on the phone”***

“But you keep my old scarf from that very first week, 'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me you can't get rid of it”

* Taylor has confirmed that the scarf is a metaphor. I do not think that it represents the gross heteronormative take about her and Jake Gyllenhaal.
* It could be a way to sneak the nickname ""Scar"" into the song (more on this later).
* It also may be alluding to the Tom Waits song “Ruby’s Arms”: “***The only thing I'm taking is the scarf off of your clothesline.*** *I'll hurry past your chest of drawers and your broken wind chimes, As I say goodbye, I'll say goodbye, Say goodbye to Ruby's arms”* (&lt;&lt;The Rubies that I gave up?)
* There is also [this](https://youtu.be/1Czm18ZHaVc) series of unofficial music videos for Scarlett and Pete Yorn’s *Breakup* album, which have been on Youtube since February of 2010 (I know this because I watched them during my indie-sleaze phase). The series of videos shares quite a few striking similarities with the “All Too Well” short film:

https://preview.redd.it/hgwguh7rghea1.png?width=1733&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2cd5f208a8024df359d9b89e917d8014a50a6479

""You charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes. Sipping coffee like you're on a late night show.""

* Scarlett's **first paid acting role was on “Late Night with Conan O’Brien”** in 1994 (she was introduced as “Spelling Bee Champion Sarah Hughes”.)
* *""There it is, the famous Scarlett Johansson sense of humor: droll,* ***self-deprecating***, deadpan.""-Jason Gay, Vogue 2012

""You said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine, and that made me want to die.""

* Scarlett is 5 years older than Taylor.

""Did the twin-flame bruise paint you blue.""

* Scarlett and Taylor share the **same zodiac sign** (Sagittarius).

""Wind in my hair, **you were there**, you remember it all""

* *“Every night I tell myself I am the cosmos,* ***I am the wind***”

""It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well""

* The O’s in the word “TOO” are linked on one of the book covers in the music video:
* Scarlett [has a tattoo](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/g36715846/scarlett-johansson-tattoos-meanings/) on her ankle of two interconnecting circles with an ""A"" inside of them.

Some other thoughts/connections:

* Taylor released Red on October 22, 2012: **""National Scar Appreciation Day""**
* 1989 was released on ""Global Champagne Day"" (Scarlett was the celebrity ambassador for Moët &amp; Chandon Champagne)

In her 2012 Vogue Interview, Taylor said that a lot of the album (Red) was about an “earth-shattering, not recent, but ***absolute crash-and-burn heartbreak***”

* **Scarlett starred in Justin Timberlake’s 2007 longform music video “What Goes Around Comes Around” which ends in a fiery car crash.**
* In the video (which is very 1920s/Gatsby), Justin meets Scarlett’s character **in a burlesque club** and talks her into going home with him.
* Back at his place, Justin confesses to his friend that he thinks she might be **“The One”**. He has to step out and asks his friend to “keep an eye on her for him”. He returns to find them kissing in a stairwell. A fight breaks out, which escalates into a car chase between Justin and Scarlett that ends in a fiery crash.
* This same theme is also reflected in the song ""Red"": *""Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead end street. Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly.""*
* **Taylor performed a mashup of “What Goes Around Comes Around” and “You’re Not Sorry” during her Fearless tour in 2010.**

**""Babe"" song and video:**

* Scarlett was named GQ’s **“Babe of the Year”** in 2010.
* In the video, Taylor portrays a very “Mad Men”-esque secretary, who is the other woman. Although she definitely looks more like the Mad Men character Joan, **there is also a secretary in Mad Men named Scarlett**.

""We're a wreck, you're the wrecking ball""

* ""Falling Down"": *""Go on down and see that* ***wrecking ball*** *come swinging on along""*

""What about your promises, promises?""*,* ""Big mistake, you broke the sweetest promise that you never should have made.""

* ""Innocent When You Dream"" (Tom Waits, From Scarlett's Live Session EP for iTunes)"": *""We swore we'd be together until the day we died. I* ***made a golden promise*** *that we would never part. I gave my love a locket and* ***then I broke her heart***.""

**“The One”** and **“The Lucky One”**:

* Scarlett was the spokesmodel for Dolce and Gabbana’s “**The One”** perfume and **“The Rose One”** perfumes. The commercials poked fun at old Hollywood glamour.

https://preview.redd.it/4jv4z903hhea1.png?width=1655&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d580f5f690c8fba1a67c89cd66b11b74d6f71475

* The Speak Now tour intro video for “The Lucky One” was very similar to Scarlett’s 2009 [""The One"" advertisement](https://youtu.be/_kzGCZi0BFs)
* Taylor uses a similar tone and cadence in [her tour intro video](https://youtu.be/8c-7y7aiuzA) for ""The Lucky One""
* Scarlett has a ""Lucky You"" horseshoe tattoo on her ribcage.
* In the Lover diary entry draft of ATW, Taylor changed ""the only"" to ""the ONE"" (all caps):

**""We Are Never Getting Back Together""**

""You would hide away and find your peace of mind with some indie record that's much cooler than mine""

* In the music video, the ex is shown *listening to his own record*. To my knowledge, Jake Gyllenhaal has never released an album, and it would be quite the stretch to call John Mayer's music ""indie""...

https://preview.redd.it/f3fmdlq5hhea1.png?width=1719&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ffac1b82fd3f4daae9c297a449a9269e43b000b3

* This song has always reminded me of the movie *He's Just Not That into You,* especially the spoken part: *""And I'm like, 'I just, I mean, this is so exhausting, you know? Like we are never getting back together, like ever.""*

**Blank Space:**

* I think this song is about the public opinion regarding her relationships (with men). However, she may have included some nods to her real relationships as well:

https://preview.redd.it/uxfzf9uahhea1.jpg?width=2400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=96761aa22f6537a0074cf111d6890204d58ba1ea

* **""Fawn""** is the first track on Scarlett's solo album.

**Bad Blood:**

* The Bad Blood video contains themes and imagery that are very similar to the Marvel Avengers films, with Taylor looking like Black Widow:

https://preview.redd.it/ysl9c5odhhea1.jpg?width=2400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=47db8e73775ec2e7456f60d2139ff4d634cd3b69

* It is also similar to the dark comic book style of Frank Miller. Scarlett appeared alongside **Jaime King** in *The Spirit*:

https://preview.redd.it/3o1u080fhhea1.jpg?width=2400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c02e723bae8ac63dca7b7a53ba28778aca856608

**1989 Tour Visuals for ""All You Had to do Was Stay"":**

* The eyes in the background visuals look just like the posters for the film *Lucy:*

[Lucy film advertisement, 2014](https://preview.redd.it/g7lhje1jhhea1.png?width=1306&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2415f30964f8bcf4267f9dd0fab63cfb81a45d19)

**Ready for It..?** **music video:**

* This one is the most obvious reference. It is a complete rip-off of *Ghost in the Shell.*

https://preview.redd.it/2e86fttthhea1.png?width=1235&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=bec0dcc8474ad66fb2024a48eec7398a9bc174a0

**I Bet You Think About Me music video:**

* Taylor writes a letter A on the wedding cake (a scarlet letter?)
* It would be pretty ironic to have your best friend direct a music video about her husband's ex-wife.

https://preview.redd.it/9zj5n5svhhea1.jpg?width=2400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0e9e22b0d4b5e57752e0f66c62ad4509cf2333f8

**Maroon:**

""The lips I used to call home, **so scarlet**, it was maroon""

* This song shares a lot of sonic similarities with songs on Pete Yorn and Scarlett's EP ""Apart"". I recommend listening to ""[Bad Dreams](https://youtu.be/8YGqrk_81GA)"" and ""[Iguana Bird""](https://youtu.be/L2zwAtq8QJE) (the music video for ""Iguana Bird"" is also pretty similar to the ""Delicate"" mv.)
* It also shares some sonic and lyrical similarities with ""Wear and Tear"" off of *Breakup: ""Well I sit every night and I wonder what I'm doin'. I sleep every day in your room. And I sit every night wondering where it is I'm going. Cannot say what I do.""*

**Last Kiss:**

""I never thought we'd have a last kiss. Never imagined we'd end like this. Your name, forever the name on my lips, Just like our last kiss.""

* Let's say, hypothetically, someone with the name Scarlett was wearing scarlet red lipstick and gave a last kiss...their name (scarlet) would be on the other persons lips.

**Photographic** [evidence](https://www.shemazing.net/scarlett-johansson-makes-a-sly-dig-at-taylor-swift/) **that supports the theory that Taylor dates women who look like her:**

**Songs that have the word ""scar"":**

* Eyes Open: ""Every lesson forms a new *scar*""
* Blank Space: ""It will leave you breathless, or with a nasty *scar*""
* Bad Blood: ""Still got *scars* on my back from your knife""
* Willow: ""Show me the places where the others gave you *scars*""
* Cardigan: ""You drew stars around my *scars*""
* Hoax: ""It still hurt underneath my *scars*""

**Finally, the 2018 Met Gala:** ""Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination"". People were [quite upset](https://www.eonline.com/news/933515/scarlett-johansson-defends-decision-to-wear-marchesa-to-the-2018-met-gala) at Scarlett for ignoring the theme and wearing one of Marchesa's designs which hadn't appeared on the red carpet in recent years due to their association with Weinsteen (one of the designers is his ex-wife):

[They must not have been 1989 stans because that is obviously a wine-stained dress she can't wear anymore.](https://preview.redd.it/89hxnhd7ihea1.png?width=636&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0a8801c19eb1692c8a2bcbe71e99615b51fd7396)

"all FIVE stories + all characters in the taylor swift universe.    
PS: this took a lot of time so an upvote would be appreciated    

A. Folklore Overarching Story Arc -    
• Betty    
• James    
• August    
• Inez, either Betty's bestfriend, or the Gossip Girl    
• The other guy    

songs: 2+    

story: Betty and James were in a long-term relationship. In their High-School prom, James sees Betty dancing with a different guy. Heartbroken, James leaves the prom only to have Augustine pick him up in her car. They date over summer, but James realises he loves Betty (breaking Augustine's heart) when it ends and High School starts. But it is too late, as Inez tells Betty about the affair, breaking Betty's heart as well. James, apologises to Betty. Once again, he does it at her birthday, and she forgives him - only for them to have a tumultuous relationship and end again. Betty moves on and James goes on to serve in the army, but is killed in war. Betty is heartbroken and recalls her High-School sweetheart and first love.    

B. Evermore Overarching Story Arc -    
• Dorothea    
• Her lover back in Tupelo    

songs: dorothea, 'tis the damn season    

story: Dorothea and her lover had a long-term relationship in Tupelo before she flees the town for Los Angeles to pursue her passion. Dorothea achieves Hollywood fame and she and her once-lover connect over sad letters. Dorothea visits the town in her winter break and rekindles the old flame with them.    

C. Folklore Overarching Story Side-Arc -    

• Rebekah ""Betty"" Harkness    
• William Hale ""Bill"" Harkness    

songs: the last great american dynasty    

story: Rebekah had inherited wealth from her husband after his death, making her one of the wealthiest women of America back then. She lived a luxurious lifestyle, which became the gossip of her town.    

D. Evermore Overarching Story Arc -    
• Este    
• Este's Husband    
• The Mistress    
• Este's friend and the Narrator    

songs: no body, no crime    

story: Este loved her husband deeply, while the latter had an affair with a different woman. When Este finds out about the affair, the Husband murders Este. Este's friend, to avenge Este's death, murders the husband, and frames the Mistress he had an affair with (who also suspects her).    

E. All Albums Overarching Story Arc -    
• Taylor Swift    
• Joe Alwyn    
• Other exes  

songs: 2+    

story: Taylor Swift, much like Dorothea was once a country kid, and had to bid goodbye to her friends and lover/s from town, as she moved and rose to fame. Much like Betty and Este, she has faced being cheated on. Much like Harkness, others scrutinized her for her personal life.  

The four characters are connected by an 'Invisible String' -    

Dorothea went to the same High School as Betty    
Betty had the same name as Rebekah    
Rebekah lived in the Rhode Island Home which is now owned by Taylor    
A fictional version of Taylor is the narrator who killed Este's husband to avenge her death.  

Note:  
1. I cannot connect any song to a story when it hasn't been confirmed. For example, other songs of 'evermore' are said to be connected to Dorothea.  
2. I am considering most of the rest of the songs as part of Taylor's Story (Eg: Back to December, Getaway Car, etc)

"First of all, wanna say I love Olivia so much, Sour was my fav album in 2021 and I was super excited for her sophomore album. I know it’s still a bit too early to judge, but unfortunately I’ve personally found this era a tad underwhelming. And I know a lot of other people who have said the same thing.

It constantly feels like Olivia is like “here is my album cover, here is my lead single, here is my next single”. I know Sour was a huge success but Olivia is not established yet, this is her sophomore album I just would love to see her interact with her fans and the GP more. Show her personality more and build more hype for this album. 

I completely forgot she was putting out a song tonight. I’m suprised there is no countdown, build up insta posts. It felt like there was more promo for the lead up to announcing the album. Now we are in the actual album rollout it feel like crickets. 

This is her time to be out and about more. Broadening and solidifying her fan base. I don’t know if it’s Interecope’s issue, I just would love to know what the plan is for this album rollout.

I’m fully aware it’s too early to judge but this is my opinion based off of first stages of this album rollout which is the most important stages.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OliviaRodrigo/comments/15nao0z/not_obsessed_with_this_album_rollout_so_far/,Not obsessed with this album rollout so far.,OliviaRodrigo,t3_15nao0z,/r/OliviaRodrigo/comments/15nao0z/not_obsessed_with_this_album_rollout_so_far/,2023-08-10 12:06:48,Olivia Rodrigo,0.08953904
"I’ve been loving Chappell Roan’s album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, especially because it’s such an explicitly queer album! The queer euphoria really comes across in songs like Pink Pony Club and Super Graphic Ultra Modern Girl. Red Wine Supernova is also a personal favorite, and this one lyric really caught my attention:

“I heard you like magic / I got a wand and a rabbit”

which is a really fun double entendre (desperately using magic to impress someone vs. the magic wand & rabbit being kinds of vibrators)

It reminded me of the very first lyric of So It Goes…:

“See you in the dark / All eyes on you, my magician”

The mention of magic in both lyrics, which are both in songs about sex, is an interesting parallel. Just something I smiled at, these being a queer artist I really love (Chappell) and an artist whose music contains many queer themes (Taylor).",https://www.reddit.com/r/Gaylor_Swift/comments/179v0m3/so_it_goes_chappell_roan_and_magic/,"So It Goes, Chappell Roan, and magic",Gaylor_Swift,t3_179v0m3,/r/Gaylor_Swift/comments/179v0m3/so_it_goes_chappell_roan_and_magic/,2023-10-17 10:15:01,Taylor Swift,0.23235008

"I'm rewatching mad men for the third time (highly recommend). I know Taylor said she was watching this and that's where she got the title/theme lavender haze from. But I didn't remember where or what exactly it meant. It's in season 2 episode 12 when Don is telling Anna that he met the one (Betty). It's obvious from the way he's talking about his new girlfriend that he's completely smitten. Then Anna says to him ""you're in the lavender haze!"". Taylor wanted to remain in that period of infatuation. Don and Betty didn't last, even though on the outside they looked like the perfect couple. Perhaps Taylor felt like that was her relationship. I certainly thought her and Joe had a perfect thing going. It's almost like being a child and your parents who never fight in front of you tell you they're getting a divorce. Taylor and Joe's break up felt like it came out of nowhere, but really it had been showing it's face on the last three albums.

"I started listening to Taylor Swift a little while after she came out with Midnights. I listened to folklore and evermore first and loved her songwriting skills in both albums.
Last week, I gave her country albums a go and I loved the production and everything, but her songwriting didn’t really impress me that much. She rarely used metaphors or other literary devices.
I tried looking up what people found so good about her lyrics that they questioned whether it was actually teenage Taylor writing these or not, and all I saw people saying is her storytelling ability. I tried looking for what people meant by this but couldn’t find anything that really helped me understand, hence why I’ve resorted to Reddit.

"Hi fellow Reddit Swifites! 

I wanted to make a post in here to vent about how much I appreciate this song right now. A couple of months ago I got dumped by a self-proclaimed ""serial dater"" who told me it ""felt different this time."" He just came over and dumped me one day out of the blue, I had absolutely no idea and I was very happy. He just said he wasn't excited about me anymore and had lost interest, even though it had only been about five months. I knew given his history that he would probably move on sooner rather than later; a couple of months would be a record time for him to go without a girlfriend. About a month after he broke up with me, we talked briefly and he said he was doing well and felt sure about the decision. I went out to a bar for once that weekend thinking he would be on his family vacation (because I was previously invited on it) and saw him out having fun, painless. I also am new to the area as of last year so I don't have a super established social circle. I felt horrible about myself; uninteresting, unwanted, disposable. 

The other day I was talking to one of my Swiftie friends and said, ""I think I might be entering my I Bet You Think About Me era."" He said, ""I think you're entering your Mr. Perfectly Fine era."" 

I'll be honest, I hadn't paid *that* much attention to Fearless TV because Fearless was never one of my top albums by the time her pop albums started coming out. I listened to Mr. Perfectly Fine a few times over the last couple of years but had basically forgotten about it. 

But I went home and listened to it. And I just wanted to share with a supportive community the lyrics that have been resonating with me lately (which is almost all of them)! 

""Mr. Perfect face, Mr. Here to stay 

Mr. Looked me in the eyes and told me you would never go away 

...But that was when I got to know Mr. Change of heart, Mr. Leaves me all alone, I fall apart 

It takes everything in me just to get up each day, but it's wonderful to see that you're okay 

Hello, Mr. Perfectly fine, how's your heart after breaking mine? Mr. Always at the right place at the right time... Hello Mr. Casually cruel, Mr. Everything revolves around you, I've been Ms. Misery since your goodbye

Mr. Never told me why... Mr. Insincere apology so he doesn't look like the bad guy 

He goes about his day, forgets he ever even knew my name... Well, I thought you might be different than the rest I guess you're all the same 

Because I hear he's got his arm around a brand new girl, I've been picking up my heart, he's been picking up her... *And I never got past what you put me through, but it's wonderful to see that it never phased you*... 

So strategized, all the eyes on you, sashay your way to your seat, it's the best seat in the best room... He's so smug, Mr. Always wins, so far above me in every sense, so far above feeling anything 

And it's such a shame, cause I was Miss Here to stay, now I'm miss 'gonna be alright someday.' And someday maybe you'll miss me but you'll be 'Mr. Too Late.'"" 

Just needed to get that out! And for reference I'm 23 so I'm experiencing a lot of what Taylor did when she was around this age. And it's not near the accolades of Ms. Swift but I did some writing about the experience and submitted it to a local writing contest, and I placed! I felt like the Taylor reading her book in the ATW MV, turning my bad relationship experience into something good.

"Hi I wanted to get some fellow swifties opinions on something, so I went to two eras tour shows this year and I bought way too many beads and supplies, I was thinking of selling friendship bracelets, I just wanted to get some advice to see if this is something worth doing and if my prices are reasonable let me know your feedback. 

-15$ for pack of 10 bracelets these would be like pre set packs like one for every album or a set for just a specific album

"So,  to be honest I am not a longtime fan or as knowledgeable as most swifties, I am literally a midnights era recruit (just stating this because I am a little nervous to be writing here - some of you all equally impress and frighten me!). However - I really enjoy Taylor's overall music catalogue, I think she is a great writer,  and I have a couple of favorite songs of hers. Earlier this year I had this idea, looked it up because I figured someone might have already  written something I could read, and saw people discuss a TS jukebox musical. Someone in that thread said that it would not be possible, that  the songs (while great) do not cover the breadth of experiences  required to fill a musical. I disagreed, and launched myself  into a full-scale project because I felt I needed to prove that  person wrong.

What I've written follows the siblings Inez and Este, as well as their friends James and  Betty, as they deal with being women in a patriarchal and repressive society. When Este is killed by her husband (I mean, this is not a  spoiler to anyone in here) the rest of the gang decide to exact revenge  (with a big cell block tango-esque scene, which is a spoiler). It deals with some dark topics - murder, abuse  (physical, psychological and sexual), homophobia, systematic racism.  However, with all the struggle and pain they go through, they also show an extraordinary capacity for love - for one another, and most notably, for Este.

Would you be willing to give Act 1 a read? I am about 3/4 of the way through the whole play, and  once I am finished writing I intend to go back and edit my rough draft, and I would love to have some comments from people that know more than  me about the fandom to work from. It is hard to critique your own work,  it really has to come from someone who is capable of seeing it from the  outside.

Obviously it is just for fun - I am not a play writer (even though I write a lot of other things)  and even if I was, I am sure it would be incredibly hard to get it licensed. So yeah, ultimately the joy would be to get to share it with  some people now, and with some more when it is all done. It would be more than enough for me if someone got something out of my silly endeavor.

Send me a message if you would have time to look it over and give me some comments on it! Since it isn't all done I might not send out the PDF to everyone, I want to make sure it is a manageable amount of comments for the editing process.

Thank you for reading this through.

"I got my 1989 crewneck yesterday and I must say I am more than disappointed. The color of it is completely different than the one shown on the website. It's not the nice light blue shade, more like dark blue. Also the quality of the crewneck is very bad. Can't believe they charge 55 pounds for it. I saw some videos on TikTok from people who also bought this crewneck and theirs was much nicer. Does anyone have the same experience as me?

"Lot of flak coming in and it’s to be expected. 

The Guts aesthetic and choices aren’t “this is what happened in two years” it’s more “this is my life up to 20” similar to Sours.

If Guts was just about these 2 years you’d see more of the Brutal music video aesthetic like her getting tossed around in a photo shoot. But she doesn’t want to sing about just the last two years. She wants to sing about all of her life up to this point. Brutal was also about her time from signing to finishing the album, but Sour wasn’t solely that period. 

That’s my take and assumptions. Showing a lot of “change” for the sake of it isn’t as genuine when ya know you haven’t actually changed that much. 2 years isn’t a lot. 

If it is a “chapter” album you can show that, but I don’t think this album is a chapter album.

"I'm an international swiftie and I'm here to get some help.

The thing is the song 'Treacherous' has been kinda vague to me in terms of its lyrics.

I get the delicate, beautiful vibe in the abstract but I would love to understand the details, so I'd be really grateful if you could help me out.

What I had been wondering the most is this,

""All we are is skin and bone trained to get along""
I found it lovely and lyrical somehow so I looked it up. It says 'skin and bone' is being skinny, and I don't think it's what Taylor meant, is it? And does 'to get along' mean to get on with sb?

""Out of focus eye to eye 'til the gravity's too much""
Does this mean that you don't look each other in the eyes directly until you can't resist to do so?

""I can't decide if it's a choice getting swept away""
What does this mean?

"Hey Tokkis, i saw this video on tiktok saying the kpop industry is messed up for making underage groups etc. They were mostly saying that kpop idols shouldn’t debut when they’re underage and most of them were shitting on newjeans because of the song “cookie”, young posse who made a song called mac&cheese is supposedly a sexual song i never listen to it but ppl were giving them the benefit of doubt because “its a western saying” they might’ve just been a hater.

"So I’m thinking about the running theme of ‘shade’ in Taylor’s lyrics, particularly “shade never made anybody less gay” (YNTCD) and “sit right by my side in the shade” (Paris). Could shade be a metaphor for being in the closet? Because closets are dark, shadow-y spaces. Like YNTCD ‘shade’ i.e. being closeted doesn’t mean you’re less gay? Then this brings Paris a whole new meaning, ‘not the kind that’s thrown, I mean the kind under where a tree has grown’ - as in TREE THE PUBLICIST - has created a safe, dark (out of public eye) space for them to shelter in? (And this ties in with Willow being about Tree helping her beard…) AND then when you think of Daylight’s “I’ve been sleeping in a 20 year dark night, but now I see daylight” this seems SO PROFOUND esp if it’s true that she was planning to publicly come out in Lover Era.

"Something I don't see discussed often, is what really happened with the cancellation/ Kimye feud? What is the story from a Gaylor lens POV? In Taylor's recent Person Of The Year interview, she made it very clear that this was a deliberate, orchestrated attack on her career. So, why? Certainly there was a strong motivation behind it to aim at completely destroying her career. 

Knowing that in Gaylor lore, she was going to come out in Lover, it seems that the manufactured cancellation could also have been executed in an effort to keep Taylor from achieving a public coming out. Especially with the line ""I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere"", this war may have been happening for a very long time.

&#x200B;

[She clearly sees this as an attack to end her career](https://preview.redd.it/01jtoctkwx4c1.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d180a65553bab0380d35740d766d6b50166d8c1)

So why would they manufacture this in an effort to ruin her career? 

I have previously speculated that this manufactured attack was possibly done because Taylor wanted to plan towards coming out, maybe with TS6 which would have been the Karma album. But, the Hollywood machine did not want her to come out, possibly out of fear that she may discuss the bearding and possible homophobia she experienced in the industry. If some behind the scenes men with power in Hollywood was afraid of her being too outspoken, I think its entirely plausible that they could orchestrate something like this. Surely Kanye and Kim would take part in this for the publicity, having their names all over headlines as people piled on to the Taylor hate train.

Likely, no one would expect that after this level of cancellation, she could ever be a top-selling, mainstream artist again. As Taylor discussed in the Miss Americana documentary, even after Rep was released, the media was coated with headlines that it would be a ""flop tour"", with empty stadiums. Alas, she proves her resilience and Reputation becomes a career-defining era, with a top-grossing tour.

&#x200B;

[She finally has fulfilled her record deal](https://preview.redd.it/c2y301bx0y4c1.png?width=967&format=png&auto=webp&s=74b53f8da6469330587edd7d11645c5138482167)

Now, she is finally free of the toxic relationship she had with a record company where she had limited agency creatively. She can now negotiate a fresh deal with a company offering her more agency.

[A better deal with more freedom and control](https://preview.redd.it/xwm26asq1y4c1.png?width=991&format=png&auto=webp&s=7576473e5c22a87d41a0cef733b0d7e325e8e92e)

So, now with the creative freedom to make what she truly wants without so much internal backlash. What does she decide to make with this newfound control? An album covered with rainbows, a lead single called ""ME"" released on lesbian visibility day, vocal support for the queer community, a MV centering herself in a gay Traylor park, and a MV in drag. Yet, after her resilience through the past few rough years, in the middle of a gay album rollout there is another attack and her masters are stolen.

[\\""Wanted them for nefarious reasons\\""](https://preview.redd.it/7uxztkiv2y4c1.png?width=994&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8a8947de0015a92d7124eecff2761371c04c218)

The article makes sure to connect Scooter as being ""a former ally of West's"", does that imply that Scooter was involved with the manufactured cancellation? After she has bounced back from this manufactured cancellation, there is seemingly another attack against her career with the sale of her masters, coincidentally happening during a rainbow filled album rollout. This was likely done in the hopes of again stalling her plan to come out, because if she does continue to come out, the people who have been actively fighting against her, would be the ones profiting off of the attention her discography would receive if she came out. I am not sure what other ""nefarious reasons"" it could be, at least to me, this feels the most plausible.

Now, she says that she feels like they have finally beat her, as if there has been some ""Great War"" behind the scenes, and she thinks she has completely lost now. Especially considering Taylor thought that as she was nearing 30, that this would be the last chance she would have at commercial success. Feeling like she has lost, the Lover era turns from a bright pastel and rainbow, to wearing all black during promo.

[The rerecording journey begins](https://preview.redd.it/1oij8fdb6y4c1.png?width=991&format=png&auto=webp&s=f58555c32c97bd8db95d4f2b3868bc147ac81cea)

Probably my favourite quote from the article, she says ""I respond to extreme pain with defiance."" So she begins to rerecord her albums and reclaim ownership, doing something that has not been done before in this way. This also feels like a line that is foreshadowing what's to come, one of the greatest pains to endure would be having your coming out ruined moments before it happens, and having to retreat back into the closet. Which is why I really do think she will come out eventually, in todays social climate, coming out *would* be a big act of defiance, especially if she discussed the homophobia she experienced in the industry and being forced into PR relationships. Which brings us up to date with the Travis Kelce of it all.

[\\""Are you not entertained?\\""](https://preview.redd.it/4j67ocex9y4c1.png?width=985&format=png&auto=webp&s=eaa04d901e526f4834869a07ba6a29770035d313)

With the paragraphs about her relationship with Travis nearing the end of this article, it feels as though we are just watching the performance art she is creating, as she moves through the period of rerecording's. She has crafted her way to the top, she is giving the people what they want, she is entertaining. 

She has taken the shit-storm that has been brought up against her, and now she is just playing the part, as she described the rerecording process as being like a movie. But, as she said ""I respond to extreme pain with defiance"", so I do think that a coming out is in the cards, until then, I guess we sit back and watch the performance art. Still holding out hope for a gay, rock album, cause Karma always comes back around;)

 The manufactured cancellation surely could have happened for many reasons, but knowing that a couple years later her coming out plan is derailed, I think it is certainly possible that these are connected. Who knows how long she has been in a fight to come out, ""fighting in only \[our\] army, frontlines don't you ignore me"". I view You're Losing Me as being written to/about her fans, if she's about to come out, it is directed at homophobic fans who might leave. Or, she's unfortunately been burnt too many times that she has given up and is directing it at Gaylor's. I feel we are reaching a precipice where one of these outcomes will manifest, I'm choosing to believe the former interpretation, and that we are on course for a public coming out, only time will tell.

What do you guys think?

I almost hit the text limit and this is only two albums. I'm not even going to hit you with a big opener because if you plan on making it to the end with me, we need to get moving.

**Fearless Platinum Edition (2008)**

I started listening to the Taylor's Version of this album, but when I flipped back to the original album to compare it felt super different. I learned the reason these Taylor's Versions exist and I think it's awesome, but I've had a terrible discovery. I want to listen to everything she's ever done, in as chronological of an order as I can. That means that despite my original intention to replace the OG albums with the Taylor's Versions wherever possible, I'm actually going to have to listen to the OGs and THEN listen to the Taylor's Version once I get to that release year on the timeline. If I'm gonna hear her growth through all this, I must do it right. Maximum effort.

**Jump Then Fall**

Sometimes I make up ridiculously convoluted situations in my head and they mess with my emotions. While listening to this song, I felt bad because I think if some girl had been vulnerable enough to share this song with me when it came out, I'd think some mean things and risk making her feel stupid for sharing it. This music is pretty darn innocent and girly, and my first instinct is to push it away without concern for how that makes someone feel if they like it. And if I did that, I would deserve to have a Taylor Swift song about me. All that really just fell out of my subconscious, thanks Fearless (2008)!

**Untouchable**

I'm not looking forward to when there are sexier songs. I'm not a very intimate person and even this soft song about wanting to be in bed with someone is bothering me. This exercise is intersecting a lot with my insecurities, personal failings, and emotional shortcomings. Am I the one making this song weird? It might be my fault. But when she says ""little taste of Heaven"" or that he's got to ""come on, come on,"" say that they'll be together, I gotta get going, get going, say I'm uncomfortable with these lyrics.

**Come In With the Rain**

Holy country resurgence, Taylor! We're talking about rain again, I swear this young lady needs an umbrella or some galoshes. If it's only raining in her bedroom because she's keeping the window open, this feels like a fixable problem. Does her cool dad from a few songs ago know that she's spiking the utility bill like this? That water could damage the floor. What do you mean I'm avoiding the subject material by making bad jokes about the surface level contents of the song?

**Superstar**

If there were only 2 years between these albums, I'm imagining that some of these songs would've been written while she was touring for the debut album. This feels like it could be a product of that. I wonder how hard it is to be an artist who writes so much about love and heartbreak, to not become jaded and skeptical in your art over time. Maybe that'll happen, but she does seem to either be naturally very romantic, or she's great at maintaining that character in her music.

**The Other Side of the Door**

As far as barriers go, we've upgraded from a window to a door! There's a window in here too, I wonder what house she's picturing when she's writing these. I've got one built in my head with a little layout and it'll gain some character as we keep going. The hook of this song is reminding me of the end of The Parent Trap where the dad chases the mom to the airport. For me personally, I think clear and consistent communication is the most important building block of a good relationship. I wouldn't want someone to say something and mean something else, I just can't be that guy.

**Fearless**

I can already tell she's grown as a songwriter here. This song starts by describing a location! Not entirely fair, she did do that a little bit on the last album. But this is more immersive and detailed. She is still singing about being inside a car, though, so we have some room to keep growing. I'm having fun now, but I see what song is coming up two tracks from now so I'm bracing for that.

The music video is a concert footage montage which I like. Did anyone here ever attend one of these early Taylor Swift concerts? I imagine they were a little less difficult to get tickets for, but they sure look packed still. Lots of kids too but the energy looks pretty bonkers. I want to learn about her production crew because she's going all out with some of these stage pieces even this early on. 


**Fifteen**

Her voice is deeper here. Hey, she's singing about a concept! The choice of material makes me a little uncomfortable but I appreciate that she's broadening her focus. Spoke too soon, she's excited that the boy has a car. We need to get this young lady a driver's license and a set of wheels so she can stop chasing boys who can drive her around. I'm trying to imagine what it'd be like to be her at this time, but I'm old enough now to wonder what it'd be like to have a daughter her age, and that's an even weirder feeling.

This music video feels personal and uncomplicated. I'm not a big fan of the effects but I understand what they're going for here. Not all music videos are gonna be big hits, they're hard and Taylor has a bunch of them. I've been impressed overall by their productions and I'm not disappointed that there's one I'm not into.

**Love Story**

NOOooOooOOO!

...Sorry, reflex. Alright, this song is a huge step forward for her as a writer. I hate it so, so much, but in this context I'm seriously impressed. It's just really hard to cut through all the memories of rolling my eyes when this song would come on at a Cold Stone or a Starbucks. I'm going to be devastated if I end up liking this song.

Post-wiki Alex here. Reading the wiki has me questioning whether I should read about the albums before I listen. The context is so helpful and allows me to be more insightful about a song, but I feel like losing the blind reactions would be a shame. I'm going to continue how I've been doing this, but sometimes drop a note into some songs after reading their fan wiki entry because sometimes I have something to say. For example, here in my blind review I stuck to my old perception of this song. But now, (God save me) I like this song a lot more. Taylor described in an interview how she approached writing this song, and I couldn't get over how academic she was, while still maintaining her creative instincts. That's something that I've spent two decades trying to perfect, and she talks about it here as if she can do both simultaneously without much effort. I take solace in the fact that if I'm able to refine this one single skill, then I too will be a billionaire like her. That's surely the only thing I'm missing.

Unsurprisingly, this is a big budget music video. Also unsurprisingly, period dress isn't really my thing. I can appreciate the effort and artistry on display here, and the unique mesh of visual and musical aesthetics that I wouldn't usually put together, but you're not going to catch me watching this on the bus.

**Hey Stephen**

This song would've fit well on the last album. I wonder how many more songs there will be that are addressed to specific boys? For the record, I couldn't stand this about the Avett Brothers either, when they'd write songs about specific girls they met in some town or other. I appreciate that love is something Taylor is super fascinated by, and she's turned it into commercially successful music for two albums now, but it's reinforcing my biases about her from when these songs came out - there's no variety here!...look, I said it was a bias which means I'm aware it's not a fair assessment. Just let me have this one, ok? 

**White Horse**

Oh, I've heard this one somewhere. It's very soft and gentle. By the title I thought Taylor would reveal herself as a horse girl but it's actually the opposite, she doesn't want anything to do with that horse! It's a little plain as a metaphor but, you know, go off. So far, Taylor's music has been more girly than feminine. Maybe at some point in this process I'll define that so it actually means something.

This music video bums me out so hard. After having a peek at the wiki, it sounds like this song could be about the same person that Love Story is about, which is heartbreaking. I'm realizing that she's showing some real emotional growth by approaching her material this way and presenting it this way. It's still pretty young as a whole thing but it feels like a step forward in complexity. Didn't think I'd get all that from a music video.

Apple Music has a behind the scenes video about the music video, and holy cow. It's very clear that Taylor isn't just a musician or a songwriter, she's a creator. The level of clarity in her thoughts and direction about what she wants from her project is striking. She even pointed out that she didn't want this to be ""another guy cheats on Taylor video"" which I hadn't realized was, in fact, a theme! She's talking about the director here, and the fact Taylor knows what makes her a good director is also telling. She has a strong grasp of what makes things work, and a lot of people aren't able to cross disciplines and understand WHY someone is good at what they do. Very impressive. This video is 20 minutes long and I'm gonna bail because I've got....200? More songs to review?

**You Belong With Me**

I could sing this one based solely on how often it was played when I was graduating high school and starting college. I WON'T. But I could. Until she started dating Travis Kelce, this is where I thought Taylor Swift peaked as an artist, and her career after this point was a reflection of her fanatical following of girls whose teenage years were defined by this song and Love Story. I have a feeling I'm about to be proven very wrong as I keep going. The fact she put out iconic songs like this at the time is impressive. She's about a year and a half older than me, and I considered myself to be pretty creatively awakened - but not like this, dang. I've got some words to say about young talent in your own age bracket but that's for another time.

Post-wiki Alex here. Taylor's writing process sounds like so much fun. The way she develops a concept is compelling to me. Her ability to infuse her ideas with energy and fun impresses me.  I might be becoming jealous of Taylor Swift.

I've seen clips from this music video before I think. Wait, wait. Is the goth character she's dressed as in this video with the dark mascara and hoodie the same one from the Capital One commercials they've been playing this year?? Oh my God, she's playing the nerdy girl and the mean girlfriend, that's hilarious. And she's driving the car as the mean girl! In my lore, nice Taylor is a passenger's seat girl, and mean Taylor prefers the driver's seat. The only other time she alluded to wanting to be the driver, was on the last album for Picture to Burn, which was definitely angry Taylor.

**Breathe (feat. Colbie Caillat)**

I wholeheartedly believe something more interesting is going on behind the music here and I'm hoping to see more of what Taylor Swift is when not seen through the lens of young love.

Post-post-wiki Alex here. This is when I finally snapped and looked up the fan wiki for the first time. There is plenty of interesting stuff going on behind the music! At this point in her discography, Taylor Swift is more interesting than Taylor Swift's music to me. In the coming days, I bet I'll see those two things start to become more evenly matched.

**Tell Me Why**

I don't know how to feel when an artist roasts a real person, and this definitely feels personal. At least it sounds like this person deserves it, if they have an anger problem and are taking their issues out on other people. Did she say he took a swing, as in a swing at her? Or did she mean a swing at the relationship? If this dude tried to hit her, he deserves a lot more than a roast track. One thing I'm noticing on this album is that the hooks to each song are stronger and more effective. Definitely improving as a musician. I'm glad she wrote this song, but it really bums me out.

**You’re Not Sorry**

What does Taylor want out of these relationships? Has she had terrible luck? Are teenage boys just awful? Is she asking too much? Are her expectations set wrong, or is it everyone else who's the problem? I thought I heard someone say that she has a song where she says she's the problem. I'm sure I'll get there eventually.

On a second listen, I think this song sounds the least like Taylor musically. Lyrically, sure, it sounds like her construction. But if you told me this was another young country artist I'd never heard before, I'd believe you. Maybe I haven't spent enough time in her ballads yet but the flow and tone of the music sounds distinctly different.

**The Way I Loved You**

Oh my goodness, calm down. If Taylor really loved this many people this strongly, she has the biggest most expressive heart I've ever heard about. Also this is the third time this album she's talked about kissing in the rain. Is this all about the same person? Or does she do a lot of kissing and does it rain a lot where she is? I'm starting to understand why the subreddit said that knowing the context around albums is so helpful. Someone said they thought her music was fine until she learned what was going on with Taylor when she wrote these songs, and then she became a super fan. I can see how that could happen now. I might experiment with that as we get further along. Maybe I'll do a blind listen, get the context, and then write an album review. This is why scientists write ways and means up front and design experiments before performing them. That's not my style, I like to jump in headfirst and then find out what I'm doing as I go.

**Forever & Always**

Hey, this song is a little condescending! Lots of attitude. It rains in your bedroom? Is this why she's always kissing in the rain, because it's literally raining in the room where she's hanging out with this guy? Call a roofer, good grief.

I later listened to a piano version of this song and it was an improvement. I think I liked how personal it felt as opposed to the first version where it was kind of in your face.

**The Best Day**

This song is nice and atmospheric. It has the more descriptive nature I've been wanting. It feels like she's singing about her dad but I could be off base there. If I was a dad, I'd want this song to be about me. She's also singing about being in the car here, which tells me there's probably a whole analysis someone could to about Taylor's emotional connection with being a passenger on a drive, but that someone isn't me - I'm kinda busy here. HEY! In the bridge she says she has an excellent father. I think I was right! I like this song, and I really didn't expect that from the title. 

C'mon music video, don't show me toddler footage of Taylor Swift! That's cheating! Solid use of home movies to complement a song that's specifically about her childhood, to be honest. Man, I'm grateful for my family and upbringing. Everyone deserves to have memories like this, and it's hard to realize that this isn't everyone's experience.

**Change**

For whatever reason, I just don't have much to say about this song. Sounds like praise and worship music to me.

Watching the music video, this director is making her look like Cheryl Crow with these tight shots to the face. Maybe also because she's saying Hallelujah in the chorus it makes me see her that way. She's projecting a lot more punk energy with her movements, which I like a lot. It's clear she's been performing a lot and is figuring out how she wants to look on stage.  She's also doing the hair flippy pose from the album art which I can appreciate. I've been wondering how 'produced' Taylor Swift is as a pop star, and I can't put my finger on it. Enough of her feels like it's coming through to not feel plastic-y or fake, but her presentation is really clean and put-together. Maybe she just had a rock-solid support structure and people who believed in her from a young age. That's a huge gift and it seems like the case with her.

**Final Thoughts on Fearless**

This was like a better version of her first album. Still not for me, but if this was her first album I'd be like, yeah I see why everybody likes her. Having read about how Taylor wanted to be signed at such a young age, and how adamant she was that she needed to record and perform, it's clear that she understood she wanted to get her reps in and get her name out there. She was right! A lot of the time, trying to rush a process can be a mistake. But Taylor knew what she wanted and the result is a commercially successful, if somewhat weak, debut album followed by a second one that contained some legitimate smash hits and a more refined version of herself, which she couldn't have become without the experience she gained from her first tour. I understand that many of the songs on her first three albums were written prior to her first recording contract, and I've set my expectations that Speak Now is going to be more of this style of music. But I'm enjoying the process of teasing out what she wrote fresh versus what she had pre-written, and catching how she's maturing as an artist while blending those two sources of material.

**Non-Album Songs**

**Crazier**

This would be a good song to dance to at a wedding. I'm not going to watch the Hannah Montana movie. I'm NOT going to watch the Hannah Montana movie.

**Best Days of Your Life (Kellie Pickler)**

This song is kind of spiteful! Kellie Pickler definitely has the more demanding voice here but it sounds like a Taylor Swift song, at least as much of one as I can tell so far.

**Two Is Better Than One (Boys Like Girls feat. Taylor Swift)**

IDK who this guy is but I don't like the way he says 'hey' at the beginning. You make it hard for breathing is a really tough lyrical construction to get behind but the harmony here works well. This is also the second song I can remember with a lyric about coming undone - she also said that in Untouchable. Is that a metaphor for getting vulnerable, losing focus, taking clothes off, or a combo of all that? 

**Thug Story**

Man, I wish I had something funny or clever to say about this. She's hamming it up and having fun, and T Pain is doing a great job being the straight man for her to work off of. I never knew this is where T Swizzle comes from, but that's what I had named my document where I write all these reviews when I started. I laughed, I cried, I started the next album.


**Speak Now Deluxe (2010)**

**Mine**

When this album came out, I was a junior in college, rounding the first year of dating my eventual wife, and spending most of my time playing video games. My wife was leaving her Taylor Swift phase and I was starting to transition out of listening to music altogether. I wonder if she ever listened to this song and thought of me? I'll ask her but I'm not going to tell you what she says. Haha, all Mine!

Part of the draw of music videos is seeing what the director comes up with for a 'statement' shot. The photos hanging in the forest here are that statement for this one, and I think it works well. It's not complicated but it fits the vibe and Taylor does a good job playing with the set. I think some of the backstory is getting list with the way the vignettes are cut, but it's a victim of the song's pacing. There's a lot of ground to cover in the song, and I imagine this will only become a more significant problem as her storytelling gets more mature.

**Sparks Fly**

We're back in the rain! This time though Taylor seems more confident and the music reflects that. She's also sounding less and less like a country singer. I'm curious if she's writing music for her audience, for herself, or both. Four years is a long time in your late teens and early twenties - I imagine she'd have to be getting tired of treading the same ground and feeling ready to explore some more with her art. Maybe I'm anticipating it knowing what the future holds, but I feel like I can sense a little bit of mastery and curiosity behind these love songs.

I really like the music videos that show Taylor's live shows. I really get it why these tickets are so expensive and why that big thing happened with Ticketmaster. She's putting on a hell of a show at this point in her career and I can't imagine what it's gonna be like when I get up to modern show footage. Kind of excited to watch the Eras movie now, which is not something I would have anticipated two days ago.

**Back to December**

Aw man, a song where Taylor's the bad guy. That's pretty cool, and a reversal of the norm for sure. I wonder if she's taking her perspective here, or writing from the perspective of someone else. She's far enough along that I feel like she could do either. Oh, she's talking about being on the passenger's side of a car, it's definitely from her perspective! That's her favorite thing. This time, when she says ""if we loved again I'd love you right"" I don't feel gross about it. Maybe because she's gotten older, or because it sounds in context like describing the relationship and not the sexy times.

Hot take, music videos that need scenes before or after to help bookend the music are an overreach. I get that the musical artist is probably part of that decision making process, and I should give credit back to Taylor for being part of her art's vision, but it always feels like when we have scenes ahead of or following the song, it's because they're making up for the direction being somewhat aimless. This music video is weaker than all the others, and it's because the story isn't the focus of the song, it's the concepts behind the story that matter here. I don't need to see a greasy dude in a leather jacket walk down a road in the snow to enhance my experience with the song. I just don't.

**Speak Now**

I say boo to this song. No wonder the bride didn't invite you, if you were fantasizing about breaking up the wedding and thinking the groom wished it was you! I wouldn't want you at my wedding either, yeesh. This is the one she wanted to name the album after?

This is the first song I looked up on the Taylor Swift Wiki to learn the context for, because I was like, no ma'am. After hearing the inspiration for the song - short version, one of her friend's exes got married to a control freak - I like it a lot more. This is Taylor taking a fantasy to a crazy place. What would it sound like if she was going to break up a wedding to save a guy from a bad marriage. Fun! Creative! Storytelling! This is a good sign, and I'm glad I looked it up. I've got to get into the headspace that Taylor's telling stories here, and fairly review whether the stories were fun or not. I like stories, I'm not a stick in the mud. Why are you giving me that look?

**Dear John**

This is my first song on day 2 of this adventure. I wonder how my perspective has changed? That's the beauty of these stream of consciousness, blind song reviews. I'm evolving as I go and get to share that process. This ballad sounds much more like Taylor than You're Not Sorry from Fearless. I feel the pull of the wiki, I want to know the context for this but I'm going to resist. This song feels like a story about a girl who realized she shouldn't have been in a relationship with an older guy who was manipulative. Skeevy subject to be sure. This is also the first song since early on with a lyric that hit me hard. ""I took your matches before fire could catch me"" is a sick turn of phrase and fits the feel of the song really well. 

**Mean**

This is a really simple song and I don't mind it. Sounds like someone fantasizing about getting out of a small town and escaping someone who treats you wrong. It's cathartic to fantasize about moving away from your small town and leaving behind the people who will be trapped there forever. It's a subject I've heard a number of artists sing about, but Taylor gives it her own personality and knowing her story, it feels right to hear a song about it from her. It's listenable.

This is a funny one to pick for a music video! I feel like I've seen an image of Taylor with the banjo on this set though, and the production has a lot of personality. The song is fun and the way they're characterizing the audience for the song is super creative. This feels like someone had a vision for what this music video should be right from the jump, and I'm gonna bet that that person was Taylor.

**The Story of Us**

OK, so as a high schooler I had this habit of thinking that if two people were together now, it meant they were all going to be together forever. It was a concrete thing to me, if you decide to date someone that must mean that you're going to make it. To an observer, that might make the fact that I married my first serious girlfriend feel a little concerning, but I can assure you that I'm just outrageously lucky to have met my soulmate that quickly. I'm grateful to not be looking back and thinking like Taylor is here, about how a good relationship looks like garbage in hindsight. Lol, she said ""the end."" That cracked me up.

How did putting her hair up make Taylor look like a completely different person? Man, it feels like you could have done this music video with the cast of Gilmore Girls and shot it at Chilton and it'd land equally well if not better. IDK, I'm just getting Rory and Logan vibes. Yes I know she doesn't meet Logan until Yale, but the song doesn't fit for her relationship with Tristan. Fine, set it at Yale, whatever. The set looked like Chilton, sue me.

**Never Grow Up**

Hey look, a song about a baby! Some of my friends have one of those, and in fact a couple of them have several. Something is broken in my brain, or maybe it's me being a boy, but I've never looked at a baby, a toddler, or a little kid and thought ""I hope they stay this cute and little forever."" I'm always thinking, man it'll be cool when you're old enough to play video games. Hah! Probably just me being selfish about how I want to spend time with them. Taylor's pivoting to an idea about how she doesn't want this kid to grow up because they're still unscarred, unburned, and living in the innocent times. That's a nice thought but as a kid who was desperate to grow up, if someone tried to tell me that as a kid I'd probably kick them in the shin. Oh, now she's saying she wished she was still a kid! Nice turn. I get that she had a great childhood but I feel like this conflicts strongly with her aggressive pursuit of a recording contract and starting her career. She had so much to give the world, and she couldn't do it until someone else agreed that she had grown up enough. I bet she could write this song from the opposite position and have a lot to say, too. Am I getting good at this? I feel like I'm getting good at this.

**Enchanted**

This is a fun song but it got me to look forward and see how many tracks were left on the album. Oh boy. I've been cruising so far but I'm still so early in this process. I had to start it over.

Do you know that tweet that goes, ""Guy who has only seen The Boss Baby, watching his second movie: 'I'm getting a lot of Boss Baby vibes from this."" That's how I feel about this song. It sounds like something I listened to that was written by my favorite band when I was younger. Missed connections, a spark between strangers, the magic that comes from that person passing in and out of your life so quickly.

**Better Than Revenge**

Angry Taylor is back! Let's go! Oh damn, did she just slut shame the hell out of this other woman? ""She's better known for what she does on the mattress?"" Wew.

OK, hold the phone. I've been waiting for Taylor to write something like this line right here: ""she thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things."" This is a lyric that I think a lot of young, creative kids would absolutely love. It's steeped in the rich and angsty attitude of someone who is feeling 'other' for being really into their chosen thing. This line could've been about a painter: ""she thinks I'm psycho cuz I paint her face on everything."" It could be about a theater kid: ""she thinks I'm psycho cuz I mock the way she acts and speaks."" How about a D&D kid? ""She thinks I'm psycho cuz I charted her as lawful evil and assigned her a dual class designation, I'm pretty sure she's a level 8 tiefling ranger with some dark paladin homebrew stuff mixed in there."" That last one was a stretch but you get the idea. The line feels a little defensive because it's clear that Taylor felt isolated at times. She's bragging here about how the normie is freaked out by the weird rhyming girl, and she's saying it in a prideful way. 

So I think the person that she's singing about is a boyfriend stealer, and she's taking the role of the vengeful ex, which is fun. This is a super fun song that gets further out of the box than most of her other songs.

**Innocent**

Lunchbox days is a fine way to describe elementary school, if that's where we're at here. IDK when the change happened but she's getting a lot more figurative and playful with her language. If this is going to be a trend, I'm going to have a great time. Like Never Grow Up, this is a nostalgic glance in the rear-view at what gets lost in a coming of age period. She's talking about weather again, too, so I know she's taking this very seriously. I've often fantasized about how things could have turned out if I'd changed a few key decisions, the innocence I lost by leading my life the way I did, and mourning the passing of my childhood without fully experiencing it. It's a really emotional subject and while this wasn't my favorite piece of art about the subject, I appreciated it.

**Haunted**

Here's a song title for Halloween! Oh, it's not about spooky times, it's about a missed opportunity with a relationship. That's fair, there's plenty to mine out of a 'what could have been' situation. Several of the last few songs have been regretful of the past. Melancholy Taylor, can't we go back to getting excited about what's happening now and in the future? Am I saying I want to go back because you're singing about looking back? Oh, the song ended.

I later listened to an acoustic version of this song, and unlike the others that I've heard, this one doesn't have the oomph. It's more emotional, but I don't think it's as impactful. Nice to know that not all her songs are improved by pulling back  the accompaniment, that would give me complicated feelings.

**Last Kiss**

Ah man, another ballad about mistakes of the past. I'm sorry for lecturing you during Better Than Revenge Taylor, I didn't mean what I said. Well, I did, but I'd take it back to return to that kind of energy. Well, that's not true either. But I'm struggling to keep going with these endless track reviews when you turn the tempo down and talk about sad stuff! 

To take this seriously for a second, this song really puts her observational writing front and center. She described herself in some early interviews about Debut as a keen observer of details, and the way she's talking about him putting his hands in his pockets, and about his handshake is really proving that. I like these kinds of details in songs. She's describing the weather again, and I feel like in addition to the Taylor Analysis of cars and the passenger's seat, there's something to be said for performing a Taylor Analysis of rain, sunshine, and the weather.

**Long Live**

We are firmly entrenched in the nostalgia bog. Everything has been in past tense for dozens of minutes now. We've been rear-facing for so long as to forget -- wait, hold on, she's talking about her dreams when she was younger, and how she's proud of all the things she did. This is the reverse-angle song I was asking for back in Never Grow Up! I almost missed it because I was too busy being saturated in gloom. I get that this song is primarily about a positive past relationship, and growing apart and the wistfulness that comes from leading separate future lives, I'm definitely feeling that this is about her growing into a pop star. When she's telling this guy to tell his future child how the crowds went wild and how she had the time of her life back then, it really shines through that she's acknowledging that her future is real. I like it.

**Ours**

""Elevator buttons and morning air"" has a real ""moats and boats and waterfalls / alleyways and pay phone calls"" feel to it. Google says Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeroes put that song out the year before Taylor published this album. I am a forensic musicologist and I have definitively proven Taylor's influence on this lyric.

 ""Don't worry your pretty little mind / people throw rocks at things that shine"" is also a rock solid line. The energy of this song is really freeing. Taylor's confidence and innocence is beautiful here. I got married young, and a few people backhandedly congratulated me on my 'starter marriage.' This song would've come in handy in that moment. Big fan of this song and it makes me want to see my wife. Almost done here, and then I'll sit by the front door and wait for her to walk through it.

Taylor does look great in the cold. Scarf season is Taylor season...this project is really twisting my brain into weird shapes. I'm really struggling to connect this cool song that I like with the office setting and gags. I get that it's a contrasting tone for what Taylor's character is daydreaming about, but I think I was wanting something more because I liked the song so much.

**If This Was A Movie**

Here's a great example of all the things Taylor has improved on. She's telling a more nuanced story, using the lens of it being a movie, the hook is strong, the country influence is toned way down, but it still sounds as authentically her as those songs from the debut album. Absolute W for Taylor, I hope this one got radio play.

**Superman**

I wish the album had ended on the last song. I get that it's hard to close out an album really strong, and this song is fine, but if this song was in the front half of the album and we got to end on Ours and then If This Was a Movie, I'd count the album construction as one of the strongest points of growth for her as a creator. It's not like it ruins the album, it's just like when a movie ends on a really impactful scene, and then the end credits song doesn't fit the mood. I don't want to watch Infinity War, the crazy ending happens, and then I walk out listening to some Maroon 5 song. No, I'm not saying this is like a Maroon 5 song. I'm saying it's like if -- why are we fighting about this?

**Final Thoughts on Speak Now**

The first three albums have had a steady upward trajectory. They share common themes, tone, and subject material, they all pulled from a big pool of songs that Taylor had written before getting her record deal, and each built atop the previous one. She illustrated her growth as an artist, supplemented her existing material in some key places, and carved out a place for herself in the landscape of that time period's pop scene. Pretty impressive! There are a few songs from this album in particular that I'd listen to again, if I were the kind of person that listened to music by choice. Ours, If This Was A Movie, and Mean were my favorites, in that order. I really appreciated the more nuanced storytelling and creative use of language - it sounds like that continues to develop, which is very exciting.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/17kxkoy/football_man_turns_taylor_fan_part_2_how_come/,"Football Man turns Taylor Fan, part 2: How come Haunted isn't a Halloween song",TaylorSwift,t3_17kxkoy,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/17kxkoy/football_man_turns_taylor_fan_part_2_how_come/,2023-10-31 22:43:30,Taylor Swift,

Tolerate it being how she was feeling before, when she started noticing the cracks and that she was being taken for granted. Begging him to notice how much she’s hurting. 

And in “you’re losing me” she’s on the other side where she has decided that she can’t keep letting someone tolerate her for so long and be ignored.

I personally I also want to add that I do hear a lot of ppl saying that midnights is a breakup album, which I kind of agree with, BUT I believe “ you’re losing me” was not added to the Midnights original track list because they were in a spot of being “on again” when she was finished with it

"Posted every Monday for the following weekend. Use this post to find fellow Daydreamers to meet up with in Las Vegas! 

At the risk of sounding like an overbearing parent, your mods ask that you PLEASE use your own discretion when scheduling a meetup. Vegas is a very busy city with lots of wild characters. Tips to stay safe:

1. Meet in a public place.
2. Do not give out your hotel or room number.
3. Be cautious of who you add on some social media. Some social media (like Snapchat's Snapmap) can share your location to friends.
4. Always keep your drink(s) in your line-of-sight and don't take drinks (or anything else-- it's Vegas after all) from someone you just met, unless you see them get it from the bar.

We hope to see r/Adele Daydreamers make lifelong friends at these concerts! Have fun and be safe!

"I have a couple of ideas:

1. I think it’d be very interesting if she wrote a song about her thoughts on winning the 1989 Grammy over TPAB and how people reacted to it. I know she’s a huge Kendrick fan so I’m curious how she feels about that.

2. A song about toxic fandom and how she feels about it. It must be super uncomfortable for her to know she has some fans who are problematic and how that makes her feel.

3. She obviously has lots of songs about misogyny but I think a song about her privilege she has as a rich, white famous person would be great.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/117mmnj/what_are_some_themes_you_would_like_taylor_to/,What are some themes you would like Taylor to explore in future songs?,TaylorSwift,t3_117mmnj,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/117mmnj/what_are_some_themes_you_would_like_taylor_to/,2023-02-20 22:29:38,Taylor Swift,0.18269104

Do you think Taylor says the whole script conversation she has with the audience the same way for every show? Or do you think she just think comes up with what to say on the spot every night on tour?,https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/18hud6v/tour_script/,Tour Script,TaylorSwift,t3_18hud6v,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/18hud6v/tour_script/,2023-12-13 23:23:39,Taylor Swift,0.04686289
" I was cleaning for several hours and I had Would've, Could've, Should've on repeat for hours and I couldn't stop thinking about some references of the past which Taylor had referenced from Red (2012 era). I've seen some people suggest that IKYWT and Treacherous is about Jake Gyllenhaal (some lyrics could still apply), or Harry Styles but Would've, Could've, Should've makes it even **more crystal clear** she's referring to John Mayer. Which got me confused why people think it's about Harry or Jake?:

***

*Some discussion evidence (important pre-context):*

In the I Knew You Were Trouble music video, Taylor has opening dialogue before the track sets and one of her quotes is the following:

&gt; ""I think part of me knew the second I saw him that this would happen. It's not really anything he said or anything he did, **it was the feeling that came along with it** and the crazy thing is I don't know if I'm ever going to feel that way again, **but I don't know if I should.....**"" 

(Heads up, in Dear John she references her mother also telling Taylor she was ""losing her mind"" which also can connect to Would've, Should've, Could've in the same feeling she is describes...) 

&gt;""How could **the devil** be pulling you toward someone who looks so much like an angel when he smiles at you?"" *Maybe he knew that when* **he saw me**

***

Now in Would've, Could've, Should've a lot of these references make there way again: 

&gt; If you would've blinked, then I would've
Looked away at the first glance /

&gt; Ooh, all I used to do was pray
Would've, could've, should've
If you'd never looked my way

In the I Knew You Were Trouble music video, it starts with a look, which she references in the first verse &amp; pre-chorus. The I Knew You Were Trouble secret message is also: ""WHEN YOU SAW ME DANCING"" as he caught Taylor first which she speaks of in Would've, Could've, Should've.


Now the same devil reference comes again in Would've, Could've, Should've where Taylor tends to link this person as very bad by referring them as the devil:

&gt; **And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil**
At nineteen...

Looking back at our IKYWT context quote:

&gt; How could **the devil** be pulling you toward someone who looks so much like an angel...

""The devil"" nickname referring to this certain somebody also pops up again in ""Dear Reader"" 

&gt; ""When you aim at the devil make sure you don't miss""

Which once circles back to Would've, Could've, Should've *again* as she acknowledges ""hitting him where it hurts"" in revenge:

&gt; Living for the thrill of hitting you where it hurts 


***

&gt; *And the God's honest truth is that the pain was heaven*

She once again makes a similar reference in I Knew You Were Trouble (pain = 'the feeling that came along with it' and warning herself she shouldn't be enjoying feeling pain from this relationship which correlates to the 'heaven' feeling in Would've, Should've, Could've... ):

**It was the feeling that came along with it** and the crazy thing is I don't know if I'm ever going to feel that way again, but I don't know if I should.....""

***

Now Treacherous also comes into play in all of this because Treacherous has been stated by Taylor to be the first part of a story and I Knew You Were Trouble the 2nd.

Treacherous has a Mayer reference in the first lines:

&gt; 'Til the gravity's too much
And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands

But once again Taylor also acknowledges how bad this person is (devil, trouble, quicksand) all three tracks notes how she knew he was bad news. Each of these songs constantly have Taylor from the beginning acknowledging they're *bad.*

&gt; But you're quicksand
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I, I, I like it


***

Other than the songs all coming together, more obvious signs:

* Guy in music video is portrayed as a musician, with tattoos, has a smilar look to Mayer with the hat, longer hair, necklace, etc. [example](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/54xffP3-DrQ/maxresdefault.jpg) / [music video](http://images.summitmedia-digital.com/candy/images/articles/lifestyle/entertainment/201302/big/201302-trouble2_cover.jpg)

&gt; ""Flew me to places I've never been"" 

Makes sense to be in context about John, considering Taylor was 19 in this relationship and just starting out her career. John had more accessibility and Taylor at that point obviously hadn't been *everywhere* like she has now. 

&gt; ""I heard you moved on from whispers on the street...""

Is referring to John Mayer beginning to date Katy Perry at the time (as this song was written late 2012) and the ""whispers"" is tabloids and the public talking about them going out. She makes a similar reference about herself in [Would've, Could've, Should've with the tabloids talking about herself and Mayer going out and him seeing her dance](https://www.laineygossip.com/Taylor-Swift-crushing-on-John-Mayer-at-Crossroads-performance-with-Keith-Urban-27jan10/15786)

* &gt; And if you never saved me from boredom (Would've, Could've, Should've)

This gets more acknowledged in I Knew You Were Trouble and Treacherous.

***

#TLDR: This song is about John Mayer, not Jake Gyllenhaal or Harry Styles. It's the same story she's been telling from Treacherous, and I Knew You Were Trouble but more open.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/10tv4nt/wouldve_couldve_shouldve_is_another_part_of_the_i/,"Would've, Could've, Should've is another part of the I Knew You Were Trouble and Treacherous saga.

"I finally got around to watching Miss Americana, and I have some thoughts. And many questions. 

**tl:dr -** Doc felt contrived, and maybe badly made. Have a lot of questions about when the doc was made, and what folks think the doc was for. 

&#x200B;

Overall, it was ok. I enjoyed certain scenes where we get to see Taylor's talent, and her sense of humor. I also enjoyed that infamous scene (which I've seen before) where she tells her team that she needs to speak out about Blackburn, plus when she opens up about the eating disorder. However, the overall narrative arc of the documentary was confusing.

It seems like the documentary was put together to show Taylor's transition from naive country music star, to mature musician with growing political awareness. But the doc could have made this point much more strongly than it did. This is not a difficult narrative to craft. Yet, the doc is strangely weak and a bit incoherent at times.

For example, is it the incident with Kanye that creates a new Taylor? Or is it the sexual harassment case? The eating disorder? Or is it Marsha Blackburn? It may be all four, but the documentary can't seem to decide. And, why does the tenor of Taylor's music change? The doc keeps insinuating that it does (country ---> pop --> rep), but Taylor never speaks directly to these lyrical or musical changes. And my biggest question is, what the hell was Lover? She's upset that Rep was not nominated for grammys and says ""I have to make a better record."" She then proceeds to make Lover, which has a VERY specific aesthetic, but never explains what's behind this record. She doesn't even really seem to connect it to Joe. And lastly, Taylor becomes fixated on two issues during this period of time - women's rights (specifically abortion and physical safety) and gay rights. The former is explained, but as far as I remember she never explains the latter. Why suddenly gay rights? Why is Lover's aesthetic queer? Why is this doc even called Miss Americana? And what's this deafening silence about any past or current SOs? That's odd for someone who admits that she writes about her relationships. 

I know a lot of folks here believe the doc was supposed to be about something else (namely her coming out), and that when the whole masters thing happened it was hastily changed. I'm not sure I buy this, but I'm willing to be persuaded otherwise. 

For folks who know far more than I do, my questions are:

&#x200B;

1. When exactly wast his doc made? Can folks put it into the record timeline, and the KK/Joe timeline for me?
2. What was the stated purpose of this doc? What do we think the real purpose of this doc was?
3. If you believe that the purpose was changed last minute (and it was supposed to be some kind of coming out doc), what evidence do we have of this? Why can't it just be a shitty doc instead? Do we believe they had enough alternative footage to make the doc about political awakening instead?
4. What else am I missing?

I listen to Taylor’s songs in general but I’m not one to look up the lyrics for songs I listen to. English is also not my first language so memorizing lyrics from english song is not exactly my strong suit ):

Could it possibly be something she approved but wasn’t actively involved in so it doesn’t get the Taylor nation promo? Also I couldn’t find any articles about it yet, just this [tweet](https://x.com/joshualdwchong/status/1719487403365175807) from a Toronto Star reporter.

Only a few people in the office know, among them Kenny Hooper in Company Management but they have been sworn to Pentagon-level secrecy. Even Toby in Accounting and Luanne in HR have been unsuccessful in getting it out of Kenny... so far. What could this secret be? A new theatre?

"Hi

I am never be a fan of Olivia Rodrigo until yesterday. Yeah I like some songs from Sour as Deja Vu, Jealousy Jealousy and 1 step forwards but I never really liked this album entirely.

When Vampire came out I was not fan ( the chorus) but yesterday I would try to listen this album for the first time…. THIS IS A GOOD ALBUM.  I’m 30 and I grow up with pop rock.  When I was a child I was a great fan of Avril Lavigne and I don’t really know if they’re really similar ( I don’t think so) but Guts remind me my childhood and teenage years but with maturity. My thoughts about Olivia Rodrigo that she’s a great songwriter with a lot sensitivity. I don’t her personally anyway she has great talent and I understand her emotions in her songs. 
For the moment my favourite songs is Lacy, Get Him Back!, The Grudge,Making the Bed . I can listen Vampire now with no complaints but still not my favourite.

I’m really sorry for her and the Sour’s songs drama with others artists. It’s really brutal to understand the adult and business world with this kind of mechanism. I really love Taylor Swift but I’m sorry for Olivia Rodrigo that she understood with a harsh degree that money and and copyright is placed beforehand admiration and kindness.
I’m not sure but I think the problem is Olivia Rodrigo management was not good for herself at this time. I hope that someone is fire now.

Now I want to saw her in live show. I was lucky to get a ticket for The Eras Tour in France but I hope to get one for the Guts Tour . I live in France and near to an airport.

"As being a fan of Adele, I bet you must not feeling satisfied of listening to radio version of Adele’a songs only.
So, I have created this post to let you guys express your idea of which live performance of “Someone Like You” is your cup of tea!!
Let me begin first. For me, my favourite live performance of that song is the BRIT Awards 2011. As it is extremely emotional and gets the power allowing me to relieve after hearing it.
What do you guys think? I look forward for your valuable opinion, kind of sharing😗

"I believe the original intent of the MV, as with all of NewJeans MV's is the concept of growing up as a girl.  But in Ditto it's mostly done symbolically, metaphorically.

Of course theres some other dimensions to it, references to other Korean film and even the fandom in general, but the main thrust I believe is experiences as a girl while growing up.

NewJeans in the Ditto MV are symbolic representatives of childhood, carefree, innocent, with energy.  Heeseo, who is filming them, is part of that group, the song is pumping, then she notices a boy looking at her.  She looks away, she never noticed that boy before.  The music becomes tense, has something changed in her?

The music stops, the scene changes.  Shes idly drinking at the fountain, and the boy approaches.  The song begins, as if to signify something washing over her.

As both music videos progress, you see Heeseo begin pulling away from NewJeans, sometimes agitated.  Focusing herself more on the boy.  And watching NewJeans at a distance, as if they are fading into the background. The vanishing NewJeans and destroyed camera perhaps signifying a fear of change, or that shes destroying a part of herself.

At the end of both MV's she watches afar at a Fawn, the symbol of innocence, and in MV2, the fawn walks out of view, followed by a shot of Heeseo with the boy, symbolizing the end of her childhood and the start of her teens.

Years later she is watching her old videos, and gives a smile, and NewJeans walks in and is there with her again.  She realizes she didn't destroy a part of herself as she feared, her childhood is still within her, in her memories, able to be experienced again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/NewJeans/comments/100adhs/the_ditto_mvs_are_metaphorical_not_literal/,"The Ditto MV's are Metaphorical, not Literal.",NewJeans,t3_100adhs,/r/NewJeans/comments/100adhs/the_ditto_mvs_are_metaphorical_not_literal/,2023-01-01 03:00:40,New Jeans,0.07845957

One of the characters named Mikasa Ackerman has a red scarf given by the protagonist Eren Jaeger which has so much meaning to her. The red scarf also means so much in All Too Well

Also some songs strangely describes some of the characters relation well.

"So, for starters I'm a nearly 30 year old father of twin girls. Not the target market for her at all. I remember when Taylor first started blowing up when I was in middle school. I was a big classic rock/metalhead guy in those days so of course my immediate response was ""Oh hell no"". I was not a fan of her country-pop music, I actively rejected it. And I kept that impression for years that TSwift was always, in my head, the girl that sang Tim McGraw and Teardrops on my Guitar. Admittedly a big part of it is due to misogyny. The mindset that tells me ""Oh, this is stuff teenage girls like. If teenage girls like it, it's automatically bad."" but I realized I can't keep that character defect. I don't want my daughters growing up thinking I hate the media that they're into.

I heard about the re-recordings of her albums and thought it was neat. But when I looked deeper into it and heard her story about why she's doing it (Thanks Rick Beato) I thought it was an absolutely genius move. As a musician myself, it really struck a chord in me that her masters were placed in the hands of somebody she actively disgusts and wants nothing to do with. What she's doing right now is going to change the music industry FOREVER. And for good.

So on a long drive home one day I decided to skip my usual Beach Boys playlist and put on Folklore. And holy SHIT I was floored. I thought this album was fantastic, way different than what I expected her music to be like these days. I've heard a few hit singles here and there from her previous works but never really LISTENED to it. Mirrorball and This Is Me Trying really stuck out to me. Absolutely love Mirrorball especially, that little tinge of dream pop influence really gets me going. After that I listened to Evermore and Midnights. And let me tell you, I loved Evermore but I really fell in love with Midnights. 

So; Sorry for being a hater for all these years. I was wrong. I'm going back through her discography now (listening to TV when applicable) and really enjoy most of it. Her decision to boldly re-record her albums has turned me into a full-time Swiftie.

"I always see the usual ""who is the best songwriter of all time?"" Posts on Reddit, and of course, Taylor is never in the top comments (Maybe if she was a man..... I digress).

The other folks mentioned are often great songwriters, but as a poet and fan of poetry, Taylor's lyricism is, in my experience, unmatched. The way she paints emotional landscapes, she can make scenes just appear with a few words, and completely transport you with subtle wordplay. The absolute volume of her quality lyrics. I just can't get over, it is the train that carried me from casual listener to absolute 30-something swiftie. 

Are there other artists that even approach her lyricism that fellow swifties would recommend?

"I’ve NEVER been able to quite connect with Question…? But DUH - have you ever had someone kiss you in a crowded room? KISS GATE! 

It’s LITERALLY using the correct pronouns through the whole song. Maybe after kiss gate things fell apart - they got scared of the public reaction, “left her house in the middle of the night, do you wish you’d put up more of a fight?” 

“She was on your mind with some sick head guy” - Karlie marrying Josh

“Fuckin’ politics and gender roles, you’re not sure, I don’t know.” They weren’t clear on the politics (specifically Josh’s family) and how that would look. Karlie had a gender role to fulfill making babies and marrying a man. 

And I heard you’re still with her (him) I’m sure that’s what’s suitable and right.

"Okay, I am here to speak about what I am not seeing about the KOI FISH....

After the Lavender Haze music video was released, everyone was picking up the Koi fish and connecting it to the Speak Now (TV) release.
But why would she make a whole MV that will go on in history just to show us what rerelalse is coming next in 2023???

The question is, what did the Koi fish mean during the Speak Now era? And WHY is she connecting it to her LAVENDER HAZE song from Midnights.

Hypothesis: (The Lavender Haze (bearding contract/relationship) she is living through in Midnights is peaceful and accepting of her melancholia and just what she wants from a HAZE ""I just wanna stay in this Lavender Haze"" 
And 
The Lavender Haze (bearding contract/relationship) she had in Speak Now was NOT IT. It added to her melancholia, and he didn't understand her....


Interesting: In this interview, Taylor talks about having a koi pond in her house but that she actually wanted stingrays! (
https://www.mtv.com/news/bbf8ir/taylor-swifts-real-life-home-vs-her-back-to-december-pad)

Now:
Think of the Koi fish as a representation of her beard/PR relationship/whatever you want to call it. The person we see her dating.

I also think of a few themes for the Koi fish in the Speak Now era:
- The obvious: strength, patience, and success through preserverance.
- The fishbowl theory and the fact that all Taylor's lovers will live in the fishbowl with her.
- Koi fish swim against the current. Taylor's love can be seen as this (whether it is queer love or relationships with bad boys: it's against what is preferred)
- Koi tattoos are also a way to let people know your sexual orientation. (Yes, i think the koi is her beard)

I believe that Taylor sees herself as a fish in a fishbowl, and she does want to live her life outside of the fishbowl. Or at least in such a way that she has peace within her fishbowl/with her fish.(her Kois and stingrays 😆 que the photo of Karlie Kloss and Calvin Harris in Taylor's kitchen!) 
(This, for me, is where she is pushing down the walls in LH music video to sleep peacefully with her fish in her melancholia. Her current lover's back in bed is the same as where she ends up peacefully at the end of the MV.)


And to me, Speak Now was her most successful bearding era. But her saddest. 
The one where she wrote songs about Martin Johnson, had a PR with John Mayer, and to this DAY Swifties believe all songs are for John Mayer.
(If you don't know about Martin Johnson, pause and go look it up!)

I think the PR with John Mayer caused her a lot of hurt (or, let's say, melancholia) after the hurt she already experienced with Martin Johnson. 

And that's because I think Taylor has always wanted her PR relationship to be more than a contract. And she had and lost a real even though quick relationship with JM.(and so with all her other beards as well. They didn't mean ""nothing"" to her. Humans have feelings) 

And as a human it is only natural to want to have the someone by your side, helping you beard/protect your brand, (for 6+ years) to be your best friend, who does want sweet nothing from you, who doesn't read too much into your melancholia, and who you play all your sad sad songs to.... 
You can't do this with someone who irritates you. It's like finding ""the one"" but in bearding, you know...

During the Speak Now era, mostly,  but also every other PR after that,  these PR relationships never worked out for her as such. It was like a hearbreak each time because it's not the guy/bestie who will help you protect the brand forever.

And I think this is why she is connecting the Lavender Haze Music video to the Speak Now era and JM. 

John Mayer ,during Speak Now, was the first PR relationship she had to cover for Martin Johnson (what a mess)
and
This relationship with Joe might be her last PR because she has found the one to share her Lavender Haze with. 

And I think it's a beautiful showcase of the fact that she can have some sort of relationship(platonic or not, doesn't matter) with the person who protects her brand with her.

And Her current Lavender Haze is her and Joe being best friends and loving and understanding each other in their own way and being able to peacefully live and share in their melancholia as best friends.

Last note: Since the start of Speak Now(maybe earlier), she masterminded the perfect plan to end up here in her Haze... thus, Joe's signs on the mastermind cover in the MV. 

(And yes, I do believe they have relationships with other people and that it's normal in their reality)

"Hey,

a while ago I started making these taysposable babies with the idea to send them to Swifties in different shows on the US leg and the world tour.

The goal is to have cameras travel between Swifties creating a photo chain of our memories, creating our collective eras tour story on tumblr :)

I specifically wanted these to be upcycled 90s film cameras both as a tribute to the Taylor/Jimmy Fallon pizza party and the 1989 tv that’s hopefully coming up (and also because I’ve been shooting film for years and it just hits different✨)

The idea is that every person with the camERA takes 3-5 pics and passes it on to another Swiftie at the show. I engineered the camERAS in a such way that they can’t be reloaded or developed in a regular lab (they are filled with a cinematic film, a nod to Tay’s passion for film making), so I’m hoping this will increase their chances of returning home :)

If you are going to any of the upcoming shows (LA, Mexico) and you’d like to start a Taysposable Cam Chain, let me know and I’ll send you a camERA!

And if you’d like to join the journey on socials it’s @camerastour on IG, TT and x/Twitter.",https://i.redd.it/zwepx5hti1fb1.jpg,camERAS tour - Swifties going to LA & Mexico shows needed 📷,TaylorSwift,t3_15ddjse,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/15ddjse/cameras_tour_swifties_going_to_la_mexico_shows/,2023-07-30 05:44:20,Taylor Swift,0.16158698

I don't know why in NewJeans MV and more importantly stage, they do a very thick makeup, with bang and make her look older than her age, Bang make her face look more round, tired and not as beautiful as photoshoot ? Why did you do that Ador Make up artist ? I don't think Hanni required Bang for her like something Lisa (bp) would do so why you don't remove the bang and let her have light make up ?

"Yeah I know, it's the weirdest combination of acts ever. Yet it has protentional. All three of them seem to get along well and have collaborated on Taylor's projects (the Bad Blood remix and Castles Crumbling). And while Kendrick is mostly known for his deep thought provoking songs, he does have a few that match the other two's style (some of the tracks off TPAB for example). 

Like just imagine: First Taylor opens with Ready for it? followed Blank Space, Cruel Summer, and maybe Anti Hero. Next Paramore comes out and go through a mix of their big hits like That's What You Get, Misery Business, Ain't it Fun and Hard Times; alongside some of Taylor more pop rock songs like State of Grace, Holy Ground, Better Than Revenge, and a duet of Castles Crumbling with Hayley Williams. Then finally Kendrick is brought on and performs ""I"" with Taylor and Hayley doing the backing vocals. He then goes through Swimming Pools, King Kunta, The Heart Part 5, maybe HUMBLE if you can stretch it. And the concert ends with all three of them singing the Bad Blood remix.

Again, one in a million chance of this actually happening, but it's fun to dream.

"This is basically just something I think she should consider doing after the Eras Tour in a few years because it’d be really fun. Or even as a post Eras tour thing after she does an International leg and returns to the US if she doesn’t want to do another whole leg. Basically I’d want to see a weekend or two at a music festival site with her headlining as the main artist each night. I also don’t think it’s entirely outside the realm of possibility. 

Considering how fast the Eras Tour sold out, she could definitely draw the attendance necessary for this, there may even be too much demand. I don’t think it’d be crazy to think that she could easily hit over 200K in attendance as the only headliner for multiple nights. I’d even watch the same set 3 nights in a row, but it’d be even cooler if she did different sets each night because they would have to be less elaborate for a festival than the tour. I also don’t think her team would have any issue filling out the sets and stages for multiple days because Taylor’s appeal as an artist would have so many people wanting to get onto it.

I also think this would make a lot more financial sense for her to do than doing Coachella, Bonnaroo, or Lollapalooza. It would also be really fun to spend a weekend with thousands of Swifties and it’d be a good return to her early career when she started out playing at smaller  music festivals and now she literally is the festival. I also think with Swifties we would want it to be annual thing, even if it’s her just playing her guitar or piano without it being elaborate. If it was an Eras festival, a concept would be night 1 being debut, Fearless, Speak Now, and Red, night 2 being 1989, Reputation, and Lover, and night 3 being Folklore, Evermore, and Midnights. To make it easier on her, it could recycle a lot of elements from the Eras Tour but stripped back and also mainly be her just playing the music because we know she doesn’t have an issue adding special surprise songs at each show since a concept like mine would require a lot more variety. She can play a ton of her music on the spot. 

Would you attend a full Taylor Swift music festival? I think it’d be a ton of fun. It’d be hard to organize, but Taylor does have plenty of people to handle it of course.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/12jbvhz/what_would_you_all_think_of_an_entire_taylor/,What would you all think of an entire Taylor Swift music festival?,TaylorSwift,t3_12jbvhz,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/12jbvhz/what_would_you_all_think_of_an_entire_taylor/,2023-04-12 05:53:50,Taylor Swift,0.075294

"I lost my grandma on Christmas day when I was 11 in 2005. I was never able to fully express my sadness due to being really young and not fully understanding what was going on. It was a really traumatic experience for my whole family, my mom suffered from severe depression after it happened so I felt I had to be the ""grown up"" and help out with what she needed. Christmas after that was never the same, i was only able to enjoy the season after i moved away from home. 

When Taylor released Evermore and i listed to Marjorie the first time I cried like a baby. It was like i finally understood what happened and what i missed by not having a grandma growing up ""I should have asked you questions, i should have asked you how to be"". It killed me.

I just want to say that Taylor helped me process my grief through this song almost 15 years later when the album came out. I'm 29 now and I'm going to her concert in November, I know this specific song will destroy me and i'm going to ugly cry for 4 minutes and 17 seconds. 

I guess my question to you all is. What Taylor song made you process feelings that you wouldn't have otherwise, or at least made you think about it?

"Every round is like a battle, but every song left in is like a dream. The eleventh song eliminated in this game, with 85 of 343 votes (24.8%), is...

**Mean (Taylor's Version)**

It's fitting that Mean was eliminated on the same day Taylor announced her re-record of an album about living in a big old city, being big enough that nobody can hit her. Mean was second place in three separate rounds before this - rounds 6, 9, and 10, which sim to 25, which is the age Taylor turned during the 1989 era... maybe this game was an easter egg all along?????

Not exactly related but what are y’all’s favorite Taylor Swift songs lately? Specifying lately because I’ve come to the conclusion that it’s impossible to have a definitive favorite Taylor Swift song.

"Dear Reader is a great song and awesome 3am edition closer. Sonically we have a lot going on the sums up the Midnights era in my opinion. 

But let’s really get into the lyrics… I don’t think I’m the only one who’d say that the song is an address to us, her adoring fans. For me it feels good to be addressed genuinely by her, without being coddled, hyped up, anything like that. A statement of I am incredibly famous- but I’m not your savior. It doesn’t mention hard work, luck, industry, business acumen- its just human to human. One is a creator, one is reader thats all. The line “no one sees you lose when you’re playing solitaire” is the only acknowledgment of her being in a different stratosphere. (also the line makes me think of “i was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere”)

I think it might be my favorite song.

"hello everyone!!
(sorry if this is a little weird, i’ve never posted here before)

for my high school english project im researching the teenage love triangle in folklore, and one of my friends advised posting in this subreddit to get help in making sure what i have so far is good, if you have any suggestions or ideas please lmk!!! here’s what i’ve gathered:

the characters are james, betty, and augustine. james, who’s pov is depicted in the song “betty” has cheated on his girlfriend betty with a summer fling. in the song, he talks about how he regrets this relationship and how the whole time he was thinking of betty in her cardigan. this leads us to our main girl, betty. betty’s pov is shown in “cardigan” where she talks about how people expected her to know nothing, and how she thought she knew james. she talks about how she always knew he would come back, and how he lost the girl he cared the most for. the last character is augustine (pov in august) augustine has feelings for james, but she knows that she cannot love him or even grieve over the loss of this relationship because she was the other woman. augustine was hoping james liked her in the way she liked him, but deep down she always knew he was betty’s and not hers. 

that’s what i have, if you have any suggestions at all please let me know!! it’s due next week and i want to educate everyone about taylor ;)) thank you sooo much!! 🫶🫶

"One of the characteristic features of Taylor’s songs is those bridges. Most of them are so good and elevate the song's overall quality. There are some songs that I'm not too fond of that much, but I still listen to them because of how good the bridge is. 
The ones that come to my mind are Dress, The Man and Out of the Woods. While I do not relate much with dress lyrics, the bridge puts forth the story in a simple yet elaborate way, and you could literally see the whole image in your man. The Man contains the message that I, too stand for but sometimes comes across as too preachy, but the bridge is top tier. “If I were out flashing my dollars, I’d be a bitch, not a baller” was my bio for a long time. I wait for the "" Out of the Woods bridge every time I listen to 1989 because it is THE best bridge by Taylor Swift, even though I do not like the repetitive lyrics in the chorus.
What are some other songs that you think are salvaged by their bridges?",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/1600cpr/songs_in_taylors_discography_with_average_lyrics/,songs in taylor’s discography with average lyrics but killer bridges?,TaylorSwift,t3_1600cpr,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/1600cpr/songs_in_taylors_discography_with_average_lyrics/,2023-08-24 12:18:38,Taylor Swift,0.11347008
"*Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone / Going through the photographs, staring at the phone*



Have you ever desperately desired someone but refused to make the first move?



The Other Side Of The Door is about Taylor’s competing emotions. She wants her muse to leave her alone because they deeply upset her, and she also wants them to stay and say all the right things. It’s clear that she wants to express these conflicting feelings directly to her muse, but either she won’t, or she feels like she can’t. Perhaps her stubbornness in this situation comes from feeling like she shouldn’t *have* to apologize/reach out, because she feels she didn’t do anything wrong. The way that she describes that kind of stubbornness in the lyric above is so relatable and easy to picture.



She reminisces on happy memories via photographs, and hopes that her ex will call, while refusing to dial the phone herself. She recognizes this as illogical while she’s doing it. It’s not just stupid pride, it’s pride that knows it is stupid but doubles down on itself anyways. Taylor even recognizes that by prioritizing her pride, she leaves herself sitting all alone.

"1. “I don't want you like a best friend. “

Most of Taylor’s Best friend is female. 
The male close best friend I can think of is Ed Sheeran, and Ryan Reynolds.

Some may say this song is from Reputation which was supposed to be about Joe Alwyn, Calvin Harris or Tom Hiddleston.

But none of them was her best friend (before being as couple)

2. Taylor Swift has paid tribute to friend's Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds' three children, while accepting a Grammy of Folklore. 

It is worth noting that Betty, Inez and James are their DAUGHTERS. (All are Girls)

but even from that lens I feel like my brain is doing gymnastics to follow the conversation. who is talking to who? why are the pronouns all over the place? it feels like a song within a song. like she wanted to write about a girl but had to fold it into a conversation with someone as if it’s about their life instead?? but then when she says “it’s just a question” feels very defensive so it’s obviously about her and not this other person that she’s asking.

"My prompt: I'm going to send lyrics now. The scenario is that the writer is Sapphic while the muse is her best friend who is also Sapphic. Apply the scenario to the lyrics I am about to send

(I send the lyrics of dress)

The answer: Based on the lyrics you provided, it seems that the song captures the emotions and desires of a person (the writer) who has romantic feelings for their best friend (the muse), and both individuals identify as Sapphic. The lyrics reflect a sense of secrecy, longing, and anticipation, as the writer navigates their hidden attraction.

The line ""All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation"" suggests that the writer has been keeping their feelings hidden and patiently waiting for something to happen between them and their best friend. The mention of ""silence"" indicates that they haven't expressed their true emotions to the friend or to others around them.

The line ""Say my name and everything just stops"" implies that the writer longs for their best friend to acknowledge their romantic feelings. They desire a connection that goes beyond friendship, as indicated by the line ""I don't want you like a best friend.""

The writer's desire for a deeper connection is further emphasized by the line ""Only bought this dress so you could take it off."" It suggests that the writer is willing to go to great lengths to explore a more intimate relationship with their best friend.

The mention of ""carving your name into my bedpost"" could symbolize a desire to leave a lasting impression or mark on their shared experiences and intimate moments. It signifies a desire for a deeper connection and a longing to be seen and recognized by their best friend.

Overall, the lyrics capture the complex emotions and desires that arise in a scenario where the writer is romantically attracted to their best friend, both of whom identify as Sapphic. The lyrics express the yearning for a deeper connection and the struggle of keeping their feelings hidden.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Gaylor_Swift/comments/16zhswo/chats_interpretation_of_the_song_dress_do_you/,Chat’s interpretation of the song “Dress”.

"NSFW: blood, discussion of rated R horror film

(Carrie by Stephen King spoilers ahead)“I looked around in a blood-soaked gown and saw something they can’t take away”

In the horror book/movie Carrie, the eponymous main character gets nominated as homecoming queen as part of a plot to humiliate her. Once she goes on stage to accept her crown, a bucket of blood is poured on her.

This feels like a reference to the 2009 Kanye VMA interruption. I remember her mentioning afterward she thought that after Kanye took the mic, she thought the crowd was booing her.

If so, I love this reference so much. It feels so visceral.

Beyond that, I feel like there can be Carrie-esque symbols in her art Reputation onwards... this of which I am extrapolating even further than my previous point!! This may be just me because I'm also such a horror movie fan. A couple of quick examples: Carrie being isolated and needing telekenesis (aka the power to manipulate things without touching them) to ascend her situation =""Mastermind"" and being machiavellian to survive; burning down the Lover house.

Edited to add a TL;DR: Carrie is the terrifying, hyperbolic version of the ""good for her"" character arc. It's gruesome and it's visceral.

"I hope this post is still within the rules, apologies if it is not. I went into the show a fan, but hadn't really paid close close attention to her lyrics or story. I left feeling like that experience accelerated a ton of work I've been trying to do in therapy/reading to deconstruct a lot of the things I was taught by my parents/upbringing about what it means to be a man in our society and the experience of that show is helping me to better relate to my wife and my kids and friends. Anybody else feel just different after? Like you got new neural pathways or something?

I've spent the last week listening and reading her lyrics and she's a damn poet and has had me in an emotional headlock of the best kind. The messages of self love, heart break, self awareness, pain and calling to task how uneven the scales are for women or under represented groups of people have put emotions/clear thoughts/calls to action around things I've been feeling for a while but unable to fully articulate. Listening to her catalogue for the first time in bulk like this I'm hearing someone find their voice and be confident in who they are and not needing to justify that confidence or say sorry because people (mostly straight white men who look like me) are insecure about your success or choices.

Guess what I'm trying to say is that that crowd of 70k people, your love of one another, safety you felt to be yourself, care you showed for the people around you showed me that a lot of the ways I have been told to be in public spaces or even in private places or the role I should have in my family (be tough, imposing, hard to read, ready for anything) that those things or ways of being may have their place, but they don't serve me or the people I care about very well, most if not all the time.

It's only been a week and change, so maybe I'm still riding the live music high, but I feel that the show and her music is helping me be kinder to myself, more curious about myself/people I love and that it was a true moment in my life that I will look back on and see that it accelerated a lot of change that I've been striving to make for some time.

Huge shout out and thank you to Taylor and to her fans like people in this sub or those at the show for how nice you all are and how kind you are to explain what some of the lyrics mean and mostly just for being yourself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/15em45j/i_feel_like_eras_tour_relistening_to_her_albums/,"I feel like Era's Tour + relistening to her albums has altered my brain chemistry, anybody else feeling this?",TaylorSwift,t3_15em45j,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/15em45j/i_feel_like_eras_tour_relistening_to_her_albums/,2023-07-31 17:18:03,Taylor Swift,0.07212844

"*Lost in the gray / And I try to grab at the fray*


Taylor is encompassed in a darkness composed of sadness, grief, anger, and ultimately knowledge that ending the relationship was the right move. She’s lost in the giant gray area that lies between fully wanting to be with someone and never wanting to see them again - her feelings towards this person are not black and white.


She tries to hold on to the scraps (or ‘fray’) of good memories with this person, or perhaps the tiny bit (or ‘fray’) of access they still have to each other. These two are not meant for each other and the ex is closed off, so there is nothing more substantial than fray to hold onto.


These lyrics are so intertwined with one another, because Taylor only wants to hold on (grab at the fray) because her feelings are a confusing (gray) mix of sorrow because she misses them, and satisfaction that an unhealthy relationship has ended.

"Taylor songs have helped me soooo much in terms of processing trauma, but depression pop is hard-to-find as a subgenre (sometimes sad songs are too much). My therapy playlist is all TS and Paramore's After Laughter (also fantastic). Anyone got any other artists/albums like this that they love?

"Hi! I co-host Further Explanation: The Taylor Swift podcast, and I just wanted to give y’all a synopsis in case you’re looking for a new Taylor podcast to enjoy ✨ 

Our tag line is, “There may be no further explanation by Taylor, but there will be from us.” 🐍

We try to really center our conversations around the music and her artistry rather. Not that we don’t touch on her personal life, but for the most part we really try to only do so as it relates to her music.

The way we’re able to do this is mostly from the fact that we’ve been fans since her debut album. We’ve had a bit more time with each of her records and eras to process the music in an analytical way, as opposed to fans who might’ve joined later on. Taylor moves quickly, as well all know, so we’re able to expand on her music and the artistic moves she makes. We’re also both musicians ourselves, which I think really adds something special to the conversation.

For listeners who are longtime fans, these are the kind of conversations you grew up having and seeking out. For newer fans, we bring insight that fills in the picture of Taylor Swift as an artist you’re less likely to be exposed to anywhere else. On top of all of that, me and my co-host are sisters who grew up having these conversations about Taylor, so we have a natural rapport that adds an extra layer of entertainment and comfort to the pod.

I’ll put links below this if this piques anyone’s interest and would like to listen 💜💜💜",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/13l5gn4/new_taylor_podcast/,New Taylor Podcast!,TaylorSwift,t3_13l5gn4,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/13l5gn4/new_taylor_podcast/,2023-05-18 17:40:17,Taylor Swift,0.083999306

"For me it is really split and I basically think of this as one whole album. A lot of people say folklore is a better record, and I’m not sure I 100% agree. Evermore songs sound sonically cohesive to me.

A lot of people act like folklore is a story telling album that focuses on a love triangle, but really only 4 songs are not from her personal life that we know for sure. My tears ricochet, hoax, peace, tlgad, seven, break away from this narrative.

Evermore also has a lot of fictional songs - champagne, tis the damn season, Dorothea, no body no crime. It also has tons of personal ones - willow, it’s time to go, Marjorie, evermore.

So what do you prefer and why? Is there one you think is a lot better than the other?

I often see rankings where one album is 5 higher than the other which seems crazy to me. If you love folklore, I assume you love evermore and vice versa. I also think the songs are so sonically cohesive that they can be switched out too",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/12ssoop/folklore_or_evermore/,Folklore or evermore?,TaylorSwift,t3_12ssoop,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/12ssoop/folklore_or_evermore/,2023-04-20 09:34:27,Taylor Swift,0.10089093

"Over the past couple years, I’ve noticed how insane the stalking has gotten for Taylor. I’ve been a fan for ten years and I think the press needs to back off a f- ton. 

I recall when the Eras Tour came to town and the radio had gotten word of when her plane would be landing. One of the radio hosts immediately called out the other host, who shared the info with the audience, saying it was creepy, and, yeah, it definitely is. But Taylor isn’t the type of person to tell people not to stalk her even though I think it’s very fair at this point to ask the press to back off. The world doesn’t need to know where she is and she has too many psychos that have gotten insanely good at breaking into houses. 

And what’s sad is they a lot of people are going to say “well she has security, she chooses when she wants to be seen-“ NO. There have been times where she clearly did not want to be seen and had to go to extreme lengths to not be seen at all. I mean, she opened up about what she did in 2016(?), after the internet was mercilessly mean to to her, where she moved to a house in a foreign country and did NOT leave it for months. MONTHS. 

So, I think we need to have a certain level of respect for people who have careers in the public eye and don’t blindly assume they can tolerate the public watching them all the time. Lines need to be drawn. If you see an article sharing creepy info about her location, maybe you should just NOT share that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/18oy9wv/taylor_stalking_is_out_of_control_and_you_should/,Taylor stalking is out of control and you should care,TaylorSwift,t3_18oy9wv,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/18oy9wv/taylor_stalking_is_out_of_control_and_you_should/,2023-12-23 05:08:19,Taylor Swift,0.25462922

"There's many parallels and juxtaposition btw ATW and other songs highlights the differences of each relationship and how her perceptive of love changes. In her earlier music especially in ATW it was about remembering people who’ve left you but in her following albums especially Rep and Lover it’s about people who accept your past and are going to be a part of your future. For example how the person from ATW never called the relationship for what it TRULY was he refused to define it and how the relationship imbalanced from the start but the other lover whom Taylor met and fell in love post ATW muse she already knew it was love, it was real and true so like labels don’t matter they can call it what they want.  But also “will you still want me when i’m nothing new?” to “[he] loves me like i’m brand new, so call it what you want”. Once again in ATW ""And you call me up again just to break me like a promise... after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own"" to ""You keep his shirt He keeps his word And for once, you let go Of your fears and your ghosts"" in YAIL and my favourite is ""You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath"" to KOMH ""Your love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep"". From ATW 10 min “They say all’s well that ends well, but I’m in a new hell…” with “all’s well that ends well to end up with you” in lover 🥺
The parallels btw ATW 10 min and This love ""He's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was 'Til we were dead and gone and buried Check the pulse and come back after three months in the grave"" vs ""This love is alive back from the dead this love came back to me"" .",https://www.reddit.com/r/Gaylor_Swift/comments/18hg5ru/atw_and_the_parallels_with_other_songs/,ATW and the parallels with other songs,Gaylor_Swift,t3_18hg5ru,/r/Gaylor_Swift/comments/18hg5ru/atw_and_the_parallels_with_other_songs/,2023-12-13 12:53:44,Taylor Swift,0.048594624
"Hi! These days on TikTok I’ve seen people who’ve received 1989TV CDs early and refusing to leak it. It wasn’t just one video but a few different people who had the album and insisted how they were NOT going to leak it. 

That got me thinking about all the pop music leaks we’ve having through these years and how we have changed our attitude towards them. I think leaks were kinda embraced a few years ago and seen as something exciting whereas many artists today have spoken against them, remarked how annoying they are and how they can ruin a creative process – I’m thinking about Ariana Grande a few weeks ago.

It was very very nice to see people acknowledging Taylor’s rights towards her music by not leaking it. I think swifties (myself included) really are a fandom that not only respects Taylor’s rights as a musician and an artist, but also every other musician and artist. 

But do you think leaks are that bad? Think about AOTGYLB. It was leaked and then released. If it hadn’t been leaked, would it have been released? Or was it leaked on purpose? 

So many questions! What are your thoughts ob leaks? I personally don’t like because I understand how annoying they can be, but I also think you can’t deny there’s cases of ‘intentional leak’.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/17g1ef9/swifties_and_music_leaks/,Swifties and music leaks,TaylorSwift,t3_17g1ef9,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/17g1ef9/swifties_and_music_leaks/,2023-10-25 10:10:31,Taylor Swift,0.15656179

"This happened in November and I didn’t pay toooo much attention to it when it happened but since I’ve kind of went back to my Kaylor era this post is a must because I don’t think anyone has pointed it out. Some of you probably remember that Taylor has visited the Lucas Film HQ in November. Twitter activity says it was on the 20th. As a Star Wars Fan i was insanely excited about this. But then I realized that Miss Kloss has uploaded a picture on the 18th of herself in a SKYWALKER hoodie. Now for those of you who don’t know anything about Star Wars, it’s basically about the tragedy of Anakin Skywalker and the whole Skywalker family. Now this could just be a coincidence but it might also point to T + K being in contact as Karlies post was before Taylor’s appearance and she might’ve known she would show up. However no one has pointed this out before so I thought I’d add a little Kaylor proof myself. Also I’ve had a bit of wine and English isn’t my first language so I’m sorry if there are any grammar mistakes. I’ve added links to the LucasFilm

"Hi all! I recently started collecting signed Taylor albums as I have always been and huge fan and bought her merchandise since 2013 but never made a conscious effort to get signed items. I am pretty proud of the collection I have going. so far I have: 3 signed Lover inserts, signed folklore,3 signed midnights inserts, signed RED TV, signed Fearless TV, signed Midnights vinyl

I really really want signed Fearless (OG), Red (OG), Debut, Evermore, and Speak now (this seems so hard to find).

\- taylor's eras and set list (your top three eras, and a fun build your own set list portion)

\- singapore segment (my show is in singapore, so i added a few questions for people who are watching here. there's an option to skip if you're watching somewhere else)

\- no questions that would reveal your identity (name, email, etc.)

"So I know theres been some talk of Taylor maybe ghostwriting with Lana but the same day Fall Out Boy released an album. And if you didnt know Taylor credits Pete Wentz as her main song writing inspo theres a great post on here about that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GaylorSwift/comments/nmdbc2/pete_wentzs_queer_influence_on_taylors_lyrics/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_term=)

TLDR Pete has his own Karlie that broke his heart after 3 months and illicit meetings and he has yet to get over it. 

On the last album there was a song called Bishops Knife Trick where he claims that “these are the last blues youre ever gonna get” but this album there are references back to the most prolific of petekey songs so do with that what you will. ALSO he was There the night of the VSFS 2013 but thats another post for another day.

That brings us up to this album. For one Petes songwriting influenced Taylor a lot so parallels drawn can usually be attributed to that but theres a couple songs here that make me go TAYLOR ALLISON SWIFT!

First and foremost we have Heaven, Iowa.

Heaven Iowa starts with a classic FOB movie reference but this time its Mullhound Drive a movie about… an aspiring actress named Betty who meets and befriends another woman and go on to find her true identity. 

the song goes on “you and i and a screwtop bottle of wine” damn that sounds familiar… 

“ive unspooled on the floor” i picture you with other girls and throw up on the floor

“kiss my cheek baby please would you read my eulogy” see my tears ricochet

“i will never ask you for anything but to dream sweet of me” see wildest dreams

“tell me when the party ends will you still love who i am” this aint for the best my reputations never been worse so you must like me for me

then comes the chorus … “scar crossed lovers forever” a play on star crossed lovers which are lovers who cant be together due to circumstances out of their control and of course “you drew stars around my scars but now im bleeding” 
 
its all just …
theres also some lyrics tbat are more petekeyesque but considering taylor is a loser who grilled pete on the meaning of his lyrics im sure she knows all the petekey lore",https://www.reddit.com/r/GaylorSwift/comments/123mi8o/bullshit_hour_taylor_ghost_writing_for_fall_out/,Bullshit Hour - Taylor ghost writing for Fall Out Boy,GaylorSwift,t3_123mi8o,/r/GaylorSwift/comments/123mi8o/bullshit_hour_taylor_ghost_writing_for_fall_out/,2023-03-27 13:09:57,Taylor Swift,0.15545623

It signifies an incredibly bullish outlook for the next Korean Wave, which is anticipated to be bigger than ever before. This could be the perfect storm for KPOP's expansion in the USA and the Western world: the combined effect of NewJeans and the official takeover of The PowerPuff Girls.

The reputation aesthetic is very different from everything else she's done and doesn't seem like her style.

During the Lover era, she only performed Delicate and skipped all of the other singles. I feel like that might be the only song she'll play anymore because it's the most true to herself. Even though LWYMMD and ...Ready For It? were big hits, I feel like she'll leave them behind in the reputation era.

"I think we need to have a conversation about who we mean when we say “Taylor Swift.” 

I don’t think we’re doing a good job as a sub at disconnecting the character named Taylor Swift(TM) that is the fictionalized figurehead of a multi-million dollar brand and the person named Taylor Swift who created/plays this character. She keeps telling us as much, most recently in the Anti-Hero video. 

We talk about her “lying sweater” which she wears when she het-washes, but I think we need to keep in mind that part of Taylor Swift(TM) is acting. I see the glitter-gate and lavender-gate “lies” and the PR walks with Joe as part of the act. It’s the character Taylor Swift, and she’s giving us a clue with her choice of outfit. The line is intentionally blurred, and there is no completely separating them… but she’s clearly trying to get us to see that there is a character she is playing that is not her genuine self. 

While all celebrities have a public persona that is not necessarily their genuine self, the difference between her and others (for example, Kristen Stewart) is that she is playing a role that the general audience does not understand is a role. KStew can be separated from Bella Swan, but Taylor (the person) has been completely conflated with Taylor Swift (the character). This was intentional, it was her whole marketing strategy for a decade, and perhaps it was too successful.

This latest album cycle feels like she is screaming at us: This is a character. This character is not real. I am a real person behind this character.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GaylorSwift/comments/102cygx/taylor_the_character_vs_taylor_the_person/,Taylor The Character vs Taylor The Person,GaylorSwift,t3_102cygx,/r/GaylorSwift/comments/102cygx/taylor_the_character_vs_taylor_the_person/,2023-01-03 16:52:12,Taylor Swift,0.2854971

"We open with “Mine”. it’s an amazing opening to an album. the beginning is extremely recognizable, the entire song is extremely catchy, and the chorus is extremely strong. The storytelling shown in this song is beautifully done. “Do you remember we were sitting there by the water? You put your arm around me for the first time.” It also has an extremely strong bridge, and you can feel the pure desperation the song exudes. 9.1/10

The next song, “Sparks Fly” is another amazing track. This one originally wasn’t a favorite of mine, but the chorus really sells the song. “Drop everything now” leads into an incredibly emotional chorus, with a great example of Taylor’s amazing storytelling abilities in her writing. The guitar during the bridge also gives a sense of anticipation, leading into a beautifully arranged ending to the song. 8.5/10

“Back to December” is arguably one of Taylor’s most recognizable tracks from her early days. It is a beautiful love song about regret and acceptance. “I go back to December all the time”. That is a feeling I can relate to, missing that person or that time. It’s a beautifully written and arranged song. I have no complaints about it. 9.8/10 

“Speak Now”, like it’s namesake, is a very fun song. It is whimsical, fun, and almost childlike in the best way. The “Run away with me now” storyline is beautiful, cute, and though it’s been told before, it still makes for another fantastic song. The bridge is one of my favorites on the album. you can truly feel the tension, it feels like I am in the room when i listen to it! (and the giggle at the end of the chorus just completes it). 8.9/10

Dear John is a song that doesn’t need a review, or a rating, but I will give it one anyways. This song is incredible, and it is one of my favorites out of Taylor’s discography. The irony of a “dear john” letter is just the icing on the cake. This song is truly beautiful. I can feel her pain, and it reminds me of my own “dear john” moments in my life. She describes regret and heartbreak perfectly. 10/10. 

“Mean”. I think this is the song I hear people say is their favorite Taylor song the most. It’s a fun song! It’s simple, catchy, and gets the point across. I love the country twang it has compared to the rest of the album. It is truly a time capsule of country. Anyone who has been bullied in the past can seek refuge in this song. In the words of Taylor herself, “all you’re ever gonna be is mean”. 7/10

Ah, “Story of Us”. This one i’m going to be completely biased on. It’s my favorite Taylor song. It goes extremely hard, and i relate to it very well. It’s also a great sing along, and I can really let myself go when I listen to it. Not only that, but it feels amazing to sing and dance along to. I almost cry when i listen to it. It’s such a fun song. 10/10 

“Never Grow Up” is beautiful. I don’t have kids, nor do I relate to this song at all, but I can feel the emotion behind it. It makes me nostalgic for childhood, and makes me excited to be a mother someday. It’s a beautiful and unique song from her, and it is truly heartwarming. 8/10

Do I even have to say anything about “Enchanted”? The intro is perfect, it comes in very carefully, leading you to believe it is a slower song. That is not the case with this song. It is again, one of her best. It is truly a fairytale of a song. Strong vocals, strong story, beautifully executed. 10/10

“Better Than Revenge” is exactly what the title suggests, a revenge song. Coming from someone who experienced the feeling this song shows, it is perfect. It’s almost therapeutic to listen to IMO. BTR is another song I find to be extremely fun to sing and dance along to. The guitar and drums give it a rock and roll feel, and the vocals tie it all together. Incredibly done, such a strong contender. 9.9/10

“Innocent” is another song that wasn’t my favorite at first, I actually skip it most of the time. Listening back to it now, I really regret all the times i’ve hit skip. It is a great and emotional song, with a very vulnerable feel. 7.2/10

“Haunted” does not get enough love. I personally place this one in my top five Taylor songs. The strings add an amazing atmosphere, her voice is incredibly strong here, and the lyrics are extremely raw and powerful. “cmon, cmon don’t leave me like this” is one of the most fun chorus lines to scream at the top of your lungs. Haunted is a beautifully composed song that deserves more appreciation!! 10/10

“Last Kiss” is my least favorite from this album. Not to say it is a bad song at all, I just don’t get as much enjoyment from it compared to the other songs on this album. You can feel the vulnerability. It is a slow song about losing a lover, sad, beautiful, tragic. 6/10

“Long Live” is a perfect ending to the beautiful story that is “Speak Now”. It wraps up the album perfectly. There is a little bit of everything from before, making it a great contender to top it all of. Taylor will truly “long live” forever and ever as the amazing artist she is. 8/10

All in all, Speak Now has been and always been my favorite album of hers. It is beautifully written and holds a very special place in my heart. I relate to it personally, and will forever cherish it. 

Please let me know what you think, and tell me about some of your favorite songs! I’d love to hear everyone’s opinions. Long live!! &lt;3

EDIT: okay, i’ll never forgive you guys for making me re-rate “last kiss”, i just had a good cry in the shower listening to the bridge. “and i’ll watch your life in pictures like i used to watch you sleep”??? it made me think back to a last kiss i had a few years back. ouch. i take back my rating, this song is beautiful and heartbreaking. 9.8/10.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/10d38nm/speak_now_a_retrospective_into_my_favorite_album/,Speak Now - A Retrospective Into My Favorite Album,TaylorSwift,t3_10d38nm,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/10d38nm/speak_now_a_retrospective_into_my_favorite_album/,2023-01-16 03:01:24,Taylor Swift,0.11192002

"So fucking gorgeous and heartfelt. Ugh. 

It's probably a bit ""parasocial relationship-y"" but I kinda love that we've watch Miley grow up, grown up with her. And watcher her whole love story and greatest love story unfold in front of us. I remember when wrecking ball came out, I was going through my first real heart break. I ended up marrying that man 10 years later. When her and Liam got back together I related so hard. And Malibu was such a beauty to me. The whole ""who would've thought we  would make it here"" vibe resonated with me so much. Thankfully my relationship is still going strong so I don't relate so strongly to her newest albums but knowing how in love she was, and watching their whole story unfold in front of us. Really makes her music mean so much more to me lyrically than other artists. 

And I know the publicity was part of their downfall, but it still was what happened. The game is such a double edged sword. But when I hear songs like angel like me and it makes me feel like I know exactly what she's talking about.

"Fearless had five

Red had so many

1989 had like seven

Rep had four or five

And Midnights only has two?

I don’t know if it’s just me, but since folklore, Taylor’s been releasing fewer singles than before. Is this some marketing strategy I don’t know about? Because the way I see it now is that singles are way more successful. Midnights has so many more potential singles!

"TL;DR: Any ideas for Taylor-themed lectures, activities, readings for 30 min weekly ""class"" at a high school? 

Hi, fellow Swifties! I'm a public high school teacher, and we have a 30 min period once per week that we are required to offer an ""activity"" during our planning period day (Tuesdays for me). I don't want to offer a basic study hall (tons of other teachers have that covered), and I'm a Swiftie, so I created an event called Taylor Tuesday in which we analyze Taylor's music and lyrics from a philosophical, literary, and social sciences lens. It's been so amazing so far!! We've made the friendship bracelets and completed lyrical dissections and watched the infamous Kanye interruption. Each week we also complete a song poll for an album in which students rank their favs. The lessons we've done are listed below (in presentations to students, sources are cited). But I'm running out of ideas!! A lot of my students don't know the music videos, so I'm showing those as well. Any ideas for more Taylor-themed things to do during this 30 min timeframe? 

Topics so far: 
-Taylor's debut and ""You Should've Said No"" 
-How Taylor's definition of what it means to be ""fearless"" changed over time, from original release to TV 
-Made friendship bracelets and taught me the chants before the movie theater event 
-Fearless to Folklore: the evolution of a storyteller using imagery of fairytales and real-life human experience
-Nashville to New York: country sweetheart to independent pop icon (Speak Now to 1989)",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/17f033o/taylor_tuesday_event_activities_for_high_school/,"""Taylor Tuesday"" event activities for high school",TaylorSwift,t3_17f033o,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/17f033o/taylor_tuesday_event_activities_for_high_school/,2023-10-24 00:46:54,Taylor Swift,0.049584184

"I may be wrong but this is my interpretation with these two songs, being a person who has experienced some similar shit.

Renegade feels like to me, in the simplest terms, like telling someone to get therapy so they can be at ease, and not be so anxious in friendships/relationships. It's telling them to get help, to not let go and help themselves, because you love them and you want to be with them

The archer feels like to me, is the person who needs help, who is experiencing anxiety, has serious self esteem issues, and is insecure about the friendship/relationship.

I personally relate to these songs because I've experienced anxiety and insecurities so bad that it led me to ending friendships, these songs give me a lot of feels 🥲

"Yesterday we talked about productions which don't make song justice, now let's talk about the productions that elevate the song.

When i wonder about this, Haunted is always the answer that comes in my mind. Without that production, without that sound full of violins, guitars, drums, the song will be nothing to me. Lyrically is very simple, but that production elevates the song so much and makes it the masterpiece it is.

"This is what it came up with: 

""Girlfriend in the Dark""

Verse 1:
I saw her there, standing alone
Lost in the crowd, but she shone
Her eyes caught mine, and I was caught
I knew that she was the one I sought

Pre-chorus:
I tried to keep my cool and stay composed
But I couldn’t resist, I had to get close
I walked over and asked her name
And everything changed, nothing was the same

Chorus:
She’s my girlfriend in the dark
My home away from home, my light in the park
She’s the one who knows my truth
And who I am when I’m with her, the world is new
Oh, oh, oh, she’s my girlfriend in the dark

Verse 2:
We talk for hours, just you and me
About our pasts, and what we want to be
We laugh and cry, and we hold on tight
And I know that I’ve found my light

Pre-chorus:
We walk around, hand in hand
And we know that our love will stand
We’re not afraid to show our affection
Because we’re each other’s perfect reflection

Chorus:
She’s my girlfriend in the dark
My home away from home, my light in the park
She’s the one who knows my truth
And who I am when I’m with her, the world is new
Oh, oh, oh, she’s my girlfriend in the dark

Bridge:
No longer will I hide
My love is true and cannot be denied
In her arms, I’ve found my home
And I’ll never again feel alone

Chorus:
She’s my girlfriend in the dark
My home away from home, my light in the park
She’s the one who knows my truth
And who I am when I’m with her, the world is new
Oh, oh, oh, she’s my girlfriend in the dark",https://www.reddit.com/r/GaylorSwift/comments/11zqcfv/i_had_chatgpt_write_a_lesbian_ts_song/,I had ChatGPT write a lesbian TS song,GaylorSwift,t3_11zqcfv,/r/GaylorSwift/comments/11zqcfv/i_had_chatgpt_write_a_lesbian_ts_song/,2023-03-23 16:57:35,Taylor Swift,0.15435068

"*He was a moth to the flame / She was holding the matches*


Moths are designed to go towards light; they can’t help it. Matches usually don’t burn for more than 10 seconds, that is, if it’s not blown out immediately after fulfilling its purpose.


Taylor’s choice of words here demonstrate that the girl she’s singing about never really wanted the love interest, she just wanted to know she could have him. She didn’t intend to have a relationship with him - just to take him from Taylor. We don’t know if this is true from the girl’s perspective, but from Taylor’s perspective, the girl being sung about had no true romantic interest in the boy. She did what she knew would get the boy away from Taylor (struck a match in front of a ‘helpless’ boy (moth)).

"I, female (19), am slightly concerned that my boyfriend is a fan of a K-pop group called New Jeans. The group consist of five members who were born within the range of 2004-2008. 

I’ve been with my boyfriend for less than a year and I’ve been aware of his interest in K-pop before being with him. New Jeans is a particularly new group and I can see his growing interest in them.l

What bothers me is that these girls are quite young. I am born in 2003 and my boyfriend was born in 2001 so our age is not too far off from the members but it bother me as most of the girls are still underage or have recently been considered an “adult”. 

Correct me if I’m wrong but I feel uncomfortable with it. Sometimes I can see that he adores them and their music. However, I can’t really tell if it means anymore than that. Whether he’s attracted to them which feels wrong to me because I still consider them as minors. It also hurts me a little because after being with him I have no eyes for anyone else but him. Seeing that other girls, even though they’re celebrities, can have his attention makes me feel low. Maybe it also has to do with my insecurities as they are so close in age to me and I feel less successful than these kids.

I used to be a fan of K-pop as well but grew out of it in 2017 and I didn’t know that my future boyfriend was a K-pop stan. It’s hard for me to relate to him sometimes because we like different groups (I’m more into 3rd gen idols while he is into 4th gen idols) and he’s only into girl groups while I was a K-pop stan, I was into everything. I don’t know if that suggest anything. The younger K-pop group makes me feel uncomfortable and maybe that’s my own issue to deal with.

I’m just concerned because I dearly love my partner and would want nothing but happiness for him but I don’t want to seem like a controlling and insecure girlfriend. I am quite happy with myself but during some days when my self-esteem dips, these thoughts come back to bite me.

I’ve had conversation with him about this and nothing really changes. I don’t want him to stop liking K-pop. I don’t know what I’d like him to do so that I don’t have to think about this again.

Am I overreacting?",https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/159ve4h/my_21_yr_old_bf_likes_new_jeans_and_im_concerned/,My 21 yr old bf likes New Jeans and I’m concerned..,kpop,t3_159ve4h,/r/kpop/comments/159ve4h/my_21_yr_old_bf_likes_new_jeans_and_im_concerned/,2023-07-26 04:26:14,New Jeans,0.1641865

Hey wondering everyone's opinion on which recorded live performances you would consider to have the best quality? I'm talking about the ones where her vocals sound good and there's minimal crowd noise. One of my biggest pet peeves is when the only recorded version of a live performance is basically hearing the crowd sing the words louder than Taylor.

"I really don’t have the best understanding of the intricacies of how sales in the music industry work so please bear with me. Since the news came out that Taylor was the #1 best selling artist, I’ve been seeing a lot of comments on how Taylor only got that because of the remixes and different versions of Midnights. Here are my thoughts, let me know what you guys think!

1. We all know its a move for more money, but don’t all other artists do that somehow? And if they’re not selling different versions of their albums then its other products so I don’t see why Taylor always gets called out for this more than others. I’m not a fan of it but aren’t all artist and their labels motivated by profit? (Gotta love that capiTaylism)

2. I still think it speaks volumes about her fanbase and is a testament to how she appeals to people. The fact that fans were willing to buy not just one but multiple copies of an album, and in the streaming era too, seems pretty impressive to me. 

3. Now this one might be pure speculation but it’s something I’ve been thinking about. Did that many people actually buy *all* the different versions and stream the remixes? Based on what I’ve seen from others in my life and online (especially here on Reddit), people either only streamed it or bought one copy and stayed away from the multiple versions and remixes. Also shes pretty much at her peak popularity and would the general public really go for different versions of the same album?

4. Now this is purely biased but I think she would’ve gotten that #1, with or without the remixes and different versions. Taylor’s gonna sell either way.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/1197e0h/what_do_you_guys_think_of_peoples_comments_that/,What do you guys think of people’s comments that Midnights wouldn’t have been a best seller without the versions and remixes?,TaylorSwift,t3_1197e0h,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/1197e0h/what_do_you_guys_think_of_peoples_comments_that/,2023-02-22 18:36:31,Taylor Swift,0.115658075

"Compared to other stars like Demi or even Selena, she has stayed successful because she is actually passionate about her songwriting. I believe even her rise to success and first album was not an accident; yes her father’s support helped but you can help tell there’s a lot of her input behind this. Compared to other Disney stars who kind of just got accidentally lucky by being cast in a tv show as a kid. I think that is also why Taylor is so nice to fans and seems truly grateful for her success, and other celebrities seem irritated because it came easier for them.

"Best: Midnights. 

I have a theory that Midnights like a more refined and mature mashup of Red and reputation. The synths on Midnights are magical, especially. “Karma” (thought overplayed by my own doing) is REALLT impressive in the pop genres. “Labyrinth” isn’t my favorite but the production (those synths!) is quite hypnotic. “Anti-Hero” has some killer drums. 

Worst: Fearless (either version)

Though this album is up there in my overall album rankings, the production is quite robotic? Or cookie-cutter. “Untouchable” is a highlight on the album for me but for me, the rest is a little too robotic and dry for me. The lyrics are great but the production end up sounding quite stale to me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/175mmq5/which_album_has_the_best_production_which_album/,Which album has the best production?

"Hi all! I love Midnights but one song I could never get behind is Vigilante Sh*t. When I saw the Eras Tour movie, I was shocked that I ABSOLUTELY LOVED that performance and song. It was definitely in my top three. When I got in the car, I listened to the song on the album because I loved it so much in the movie. Although I thought I would like it, the version on the album was just so “meh” to me. 

I went back and saw the performance at the Eras Movie again, and LOVED it again. It sounds so good and powerful in the movie. Soon I decided to give the song on the album a listen again and it just sounds not the same. I’m not sure what it is, but it seems a bit hollow or empty. 

Did anyone else have this experience and do you know why? Is it the powerful dancing? Is her voice louder? What makes me like the song in the movie but not the album!

"I recently ordered another shirt from the Lover era (my favorite) from the site.

I first wanted to check in to see how anyone else’s gray tie-dyed shirt with her on the front with her arms stretched out and the long fringe denim jacket was holding up. Mine is a weird color now and definitely not tie-dyed looking. I wanted to get another one and went through store options to treat myself.

I ended up getting the Cruel Summer one. It turns out it’s also an interesting blue shade but I just loved the photo shoot for that one and wanted one with imagery from it. I didn’t realize the “I love you” on the front would look so small (I got an XL so maybe that had something to do with it) and I also didn’t realize how odd it might be for people to see “ain’t that the worst thing you ever heard” with Taylor’s face on my back. I teach at a high school and I want to wear this on Fridays but I think they’re going to roast this, haha.

I didn’t really want the pink heart one because it’s white and felt the most plain to me compared to the other era shirts.

"Kind of an awkward title, but I couldn't think of a better way to phrase it. Inspired by another post here, I decided to make a Playlist of my top 50 Taylor Swift songs. Then, because I've been home sick from work and incredibly bored, I decided to rank them so I could finally decide my top 5/10/15/etc. I basically went through the Playlist that was initially in random order and reordered based on which song I liked better until I had gone through all 50. At the end, my top 10 Taylor Swift songs are:

1. Would've, Could've, Should've 
2. Mirrorball
3. Ivy
4. Daylight
5. My Tears Ricochet
6. The Archer
7. All too Well (10 minute version)
8. Cornelia Street
9. Lover
10. Sparks Fly

Even though I knew I loved all these songs individually, I was still really surprised by some things when I put my rankings together. If you asked me my favorite albums, I would say Evermore and 1989 - yet I only have one Evermore song in my top 10 and not a single one from 1989! (Wildest Dreams is number 11- I went back and forth for awhile, but I had to admit to myself I like Sparks Fly just the tiniest bit more). Also, I would not say that Lover is my favorite album, but  it takes 4 of the top 10 spots! It's got me wondering if anyone else has done something like this and been surprised by the results before. Taylor has so many songs it was really interesting to really sit down and rank them like this, so I'm sure I'm not the only one.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/143rpuc/have_you_ever_surprised_yourself_with_your_own/,Have you ever surprised yourself with your own Taylor related opinions?,TaylorSwift,t3_143rpuc,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/143rpuc/have_you_ever_surprised_yourself_with_your_own/,2023-06-07 22:51:26,Taylor Swift,0.15490346
"Hi,

Super random, but have any of you ever experienced the Mandela Effect with any of Taylor’s lyrics before??

I don’t mean you misheard a lyric and thought that was the lyrics the entire time (although, I suppose that could be the case for many Mandela Effect cases). I mean, you were certain the lyric was one thing and then one day, the lyric was a completely different lyric.

It’s happened to me twice:

The first time was with a song from reputation. I don’t remember which song. I just remember realizing two words were suddenly in each other’s place, and thinking it was strange, but of course, I gaslit myself into believing the “swapped” lyrics were the lyrics all along.

Then, the other day, it happened with “The Lucky One.”

This past year, I’ve been resonating with this song HARD!! I listen to it like 3-4 times a week.

Living in LA, I’ve always sang:

“In the Angel city, chasing fortune and fame.”

because I thought it was more relatable than

“In the Empire city, chasing fortune and fame.”

which I SWEAR was the lyric all along, but it turns out is not??!!!

Again, I was ready to gaslight myself into thinking maybe I misheard the lyric this entire time, but then I remembered

1) Taylor is obsessed with NY and has never sang about Los Angeles.

2) The song literally references “Madison Square.”

Please tell me I’m not crazy. Please tell me someone remembers “The Lucky One” taking place in the “Empire city,” not the “Angel’s city.”

Has this ever happened to any of you with any other songs?? Anyone else need assurance that they’re not crazy??!!! 😭💕",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/159srai/mandela_effect_in_taylors_lyrics/,Mandela Effect in Taylor’s Lyrics??,TaylorSwift,t3_159srai,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/159srai/mandela_effect_in_taylors_lyrics/,2023-07-26 02:19:01,Taylor Swift,0.11316007

"So I've been ---[deep diving and reading the master posts](https://www.tumblr.com/swiftgronmasterpost/638244577767309313/late-stage-swiftgron-part-2-things-get-loud-with) of each person Taylor has been thought of as dating and I just got to April 20, 2018 which is when the song Babe came out. The tumblr says:   


>**April 20, 2018 - Babe (a song that Taylor wrote in the** ***Red*** **era) about a lover with shall we say “commitment issues”.**   
>  
>Later when the Babe music video is released people (even non Gaylors) notice that it is nearly a shot for shot remake of the I’m Not The Only One music video that Dianna starred in back in 2014.   
>  
>What’s more psychotic is that the song Babe itself is only three minutes and 35 seconds long:  
>  
>But the music video has had a full minute and 4 seconds to it to **make it the** ***exact same length*** **as the I’m Not The Only One music video.**

they then add

> Another theory I’ve been mulling over is the possibility that Dianna and Taylor hooked up some time in 2018 prompting Taylor to paint herself as the other woman (as Dianna would be cheating on Winston making Taylor the other woman) in the mv.  There’s no hard evidence for it but it’s possible... 

Which got me thinking... It makes total sense that in the Babe MV, she's playing the other woman --- if she *had* planned to release it on *Red* and made a MV at that time... then she, most likely, would have been the one cheated on not the other woman. Meaning she'd be playing the role that Jennifer plays in the MV.  Which is what Dianna played in I'm Not The Only One.  
But, she didn't, she held off for whatever reason and instead gave it to Sugarland... So, it makes sense that she'd play the *other woman* since it's not her singing about ""it being the last time she'll call the person 'babe'"" (aka being the lead singer) instead, she provides the backup vocals and plays --- the other woman.   


Which meshes really well with the theory that maybe Dianna and Taylor hooked up when Dianna was with Winston (whether they were PR or not isn't the point here).  And maybe her choosing to make it basically a scene for scene copy was her way of reaching out to Dianna or processing the ending of their relationship?   


honestly idk it was just a thought that popped into my head and I can't seem to let the idea go so I wanted to share it.

"Hello :) I’ve spent a few days watching this video nonstop, trying to figure out the hidden meaning behind it, and about 2 minutes before I started typing this out, the music video just clicked for me. However, this took me hours to fully understand, and it went through multiple changes. So with that being said, here’s my theory on the music video for “OMG.”

**!!!Disclaimer!!!** This is just my personal opinion, and to be honest, it is probably wrong, but I still stand by it! Also, if you’d like to read my theory on Ditto, you can find it here-[https://www.reddit.com/r/NewJeans/comments/10487rt/was\_heeso\_newjeanss\_friend\_or\_not/j33u3l8/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewJeans/comments/10487rt/was_heeso_newjeanss_friend_or_not/j33u3l8/?context=3)  (the link tool isn't working on my phone, sad sad sad)

So, to get a grasp on the entire premise of the music video, you have to listen to one of the first things that Hanni says:

*“And I’m starting to get confused between what others say about me and the real me.”*

While Ditto was an INCREDIBLE story of a fan’s obsession with idols, OMG flips the script and is about NewJeans beginning to lose their true selves. The line between who they are and who the media and fans think they are is getting thinner and thinner, and they are losing who they are as normal girls along the way. They aren’t the perfect idols that fans want them to be.

I’m going to go through each member’s reason behind why they were at the psychiatric hospital and what it represents.

**Hanni -** this one is pretty straightforward because it sets the tone of the whole video; she believes she is an iPhone. But what she says is very interesting. “I exist for you.” “It doesn’t matter who I am anymore.” She is an idol, she believes her only goal is to bring us entertainment by “speaking and singing for us.” It doesn’t matter to her anymore who she really is, as long as we are happy. But she is overwhelmed by trying to be our form of entertainment, shown when she is trying to rummage through the hundreds of emails or gets tired after running on the vinyl. iPhones provide endless amounts of entertainment, but it is apparent that she can't provide that; even she has her limits.

**Minji -** she believes she is actually a doctor that is taking care of the rest of the group. This represents her role as the leader of NewJeans. As a leader in anything, you have a lot of responsibility. She is shown as a doctor behind each girls’ hallucinations, which represents her trying to help them with their problems as the group’s leader. She's actively playing the role of leader and takes them to the hospital because she realizes that her members all are starting to lose who they were pre-debut. But, the last person she reaches out to help turns out to be herself. Spending a lot of time helping the other members has left Minji little time for self-reflecting and healing. As the leader, who is there to help her with her problems? She is the first one in the group to realize that they need to talk about their issues.

**Hyein -** this one was the toughest to decipher, but I think I figured it out. This is going to be a long one because A LOT happens. Hyein opens a book titled “My Love Story.” In the book, there are seven titles of movies or stories:

\-La Boum

\-Cinderella

\-Subway

\-A Little Match Girl

\-Snow White

\-Sleeping Beauty

\-Revenant

Although Subway could just be a literal subway because the only films I found are titled that just don’t make sense in regards to the MV. Danielle is acting as Hyein’s love interest and when she puts the headphones on Hyein, it is based on a scene from La Boum, a French teen romance film. Then, Hyein’s apple watch strikes midnight and she leaves Danielle, who finds her glass slipper like Cinderella. She gets into the subway but then she is in a dark room, lighting a match like the girl from the fairy tale A Little Match Girl, which is a somber story about a dying girl that sees her hopes and dreams each time she lights a match. Then Haerin appears holding a poison apple like in Snow White, which Hyein eats and becomes paralyzed. She is waiting for true love’s kiss to wake her up. Danielle, like Prince Phillip in Sleeping Beauty, is now seen riding her motorcycle to help Hyein, but she is immediately dead on the ground, and a bear, like in Revenant, is towering over a still-paralyzed Hyein.

So what does it all mean? Well, I believe when it is black and white, it is her time before she becomes an idol. Hyein is holding a bunny cake when Danielle puts headphones on her, which represents her accepting her role as a member of NewJeans. Hyein leaves her normal teenage life, represented by Danielle, to travel to Hybe to become an idol. As soon as she lights the match to see her dreams and goals, Haerin offers her a poison apple, or idol life, which is tempting but dangerous. Why? Because she’s fourteen, barely a teenager. As soon as Hyein lights the match, it goes from black and white to color. This is when Hyein becomes an idol and is living what the world believes is a fairy tale. Danielle, her normal life, comes racing to try and overcome the fame, now showing its true colors by being seen as a bear, but Danielle doesn’t succeed. This leaves her scared and vulnerable. In a video on Ban Heesoo's channel, it is mentioned that she has ""princess syndrome."" But she isn’t living the fairy tale people think she is, she’s just a young teenager in the big world of K-pop.

**Haerin -** She sees herself as a cat. In reality, her feline-like features have given her quite some attention, to the point that it’s her only identity. If anyone doesn’t know this, the plastic wrapper that she is eating is a Korean treat for cats. However, she is seen drawing pictures through the MV. I believe it represents her creativity and talent, that she is more than her physical features. Also, when she is listening to the other girls talk about who or what they think they are, Haerin is drawing them on her notepad. This could possibly represent her being a true introvert. She isn't like extrovert Minji, who is a doctor playing the role of actively trying to help the other girls with their problems. She instead decides to put them in writing, possibly representing that she still is there for them, but in her own way.

**Danielle -** She is shown laughing at a tv screen with nothing on it. This represents her being seen as the always happy and smiling member of the group, no matter how she’s actually feeling. She feels like she is almost forced to show that she is a ray of sunshine at all times. Later, she realizes they are shooting a music video. Some people think that is why she is at the psychiatric hospital, but I believe that Danielle is actually right. She is the first one that wants to go back to when they debuted. Before they garnered all this fame and attention. Before they started losing who they really are. She then reminds the girls that they are NewJeans, and the video flashes back to Attention. She wishes to go back to when they started, back to when they knew who they were.

**Heesoo -** if you look closely during the girls’ dance breaks when they are in their hospital gowns, there is a sixth patient sitting in a chair in the background. I believe this is Ban Heesoo or bunnies. The girls are dancing in their gowns, and at times they aren’t smiling, sometimes even frowning, and the lighting in the room is very dim. But, then the scene changes and they are in new clothes in the hospital with brighter lighting, and it changes once more and they are at a party. In both these scenes, they are smiling and happy. I believe this is what Heesoo, or bunnies, believe that NewJeans are feeling at all times, nothing but joy. However, the reality is that they are just like her, they have mental anguish just like she does. When the girls are dancing at the party, none of the people in the background even notice they are there. This is a big indicator that they aren’t even there and that this is all in Heesoo’s imagination.

**The ending -**  when it flashes back to Attention, they sing “Got me looking for attention” but Minji stops it before it continues. I truly believe the girls have come to realize that they need to fix their problems and go back to the beginning when they knew who they were, before the attention. She then leads the girls out of the room, now much better off than when the video started.

**The male patient -** The male patient is on the outside looking in, and sees the girls at the round table as different people in different fields and lifestyles. I believe this shows that everyone is dealing with something in life, and we all need to work on our mental health, no matter how different the problems we are dealing with are.

**The doctor -** I had a theory about him, but /u/Baracudasi told me that he is played by Korean cartoonist Lee Byung Gun. This completely changed his role for me. I now believe that at the beginning, he doesn’t understand why they are dealing with these problems, they’re wealthy and famous. But at the end, he picks up the notepad with Haerin’s drawings depicting all of the different things the girls think they are. They then come to life in his head, because he has a newfound understanding and appreciation that they are more than what the world portrays them as.

**Post-credits scene -** Someone is typing a post stating that they are uncomfortable with the themes in their music videos and wish they would just look pretty and dance. This is obviously a hater of NewJeans and the deeper message in their music videos. People don’t like seeing things that make them feel uncomfortable, because it is painful to analyze their own lives. In many cultures, mental health isn’t seen as a serious issue, so some people just want a shallow message, not a deep, profound one. Minji, dressed as a doctor, comes in and tells the unknown person that their “time’s up.” They are also a patient and it shows that even their haters are dealing with their own problems and they need just as much help as everyone else.

This music video’s message is way too deep for anyone to get the full picture, and it is honestly up to the viewer to come to their own conclusions. I’m pretty sure I missed a ton of things and was wrong on many others, but from my perspective, this is an absolutely amazing representation that the girls are just like us, they are human too and they are much more than what the media and the idol system represent them as. It has a huge focus on mental health, which doesn’t have much representation in today’s world. It also shows how the idol system can have lasting repercussions on the idols themselves, and a conversation needs to be had about it.

it's not even the fact that the signed cds / other listings are selling out so fast. it's the fact that taylor's website is removing these listings so fast as well - i'm talking like the SECOND they sell out. 

i'm so confused - why won't they just give us a heads up on when theyre going to drop new merch, or just tell us what they have in store for the day? or just you know, not remove these items - is there just not enough stock on their end, or are bots just buying up the merch so quickly that real people can't even check out? 

unless something changes, i really doubt i'm going to be able to get anything off these secret drops. as an international swiftie... these drops aren't worth staying up till 4am for anymore despite having school bc it's just unrealistic and unsustainable

"So I’m clearly ‘behind’. There are so many editions of things right now that I’ve really confused myself honestly. Being an international fan, I also have zero idea at this point what is and isn’t US-exclusive.

Could someone run through all the ‘editions’ and explain where they’re sold, whether they’re US-exclusive, purely digital, etc?

My main bamboozlement is the new releases with the audio clips (pls try to keep personal feelings about the cost aside from this thread as it’s really not what I’m asking and this all seems complicated enough lol). Are they sold physically? Do we get the new images to keep either as posters, in a booklet like the vinyl or are they just new on the digital ones?

Somewhere after 3AM version and the target exclusive ‘hits different’ copies I lost track. All I can see to buy online are the OG 4 colour vinyls and CDs. Is this all we can actually buy right now? What works with the clock? I really want a clock but idk what editions (vinyl? CD?) I should be buying before the hands etc come back into stock. Aside from clock though, I’m just super confused!!

"So I ordered myself a speak now cardigan when they were first dropped so it was the first shipment date (September I believe) when I ordered. Then my friend wasn’t answering her phone so I just impulse ordered one for her too which ended up being the second shipment date (November). Both the same size. The second one just got delivered though I had mine since August. When I checked hers for holes and such to make sure it was all good I felt like it looked slightly different than mine. Hers seems slightly softer than mine though the color is the same and the tags are all the same. Also, the weaving on hers (November) seems ‘tighter’ than mine (September) and the cords on hers are less raised so they’re less noticeable. Since these are very small differences it’s not noticeable really in pictures. Kind of second guessing myself on this & wondering if I’m looking at them too much. Anyone else happen to have both order dates and can confirm if they also noticed these differences? I’m wondering if maybe the second shipment date was produced at a different factory or something (though both say made in China).",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwiftMerch/comments/171leod/different_versions_of_speak_now_tv_cardigan/,Different versions of Speak Now TV cardigan?,TaylorSwiftMerch,t3_171leod,/r/TaylorSwiftMerch/comments/171leod/different_versions_of_speak_now_tv_cardigan/,2023-10-06 19:30:10,Taylor Swift,0.07212844

**All Too Well (5 Minute Version)** is your Taylor's Version Cup champion!!

Still a massive fan favourite among the community, All Too Well is still undoubtedly the song to beat, despite only the five-minute version participating. It's a great masterpiece of a song, and I definitely can't argue against it for the crown. Commiserations to Haunted, which put up a great run to reach the final!

With that, another cup game has come to an end - hope you enjoyed participating in this game as much as I did hosting!

"The instrumental to “Mastermind” was used for the Midnights teaser trailer last year and I was obsessed with the instrumental. I loved it so much that when the album finally dropped, I found myself going back to the instrumental more than the actual song. 

Another possible contender for this is also “New Romantics”. This time, I love both the instrumental and actual song almost equally but the production on that is SO insane that I do find myself returning to the instrumental quite a bit. I will say, I do prefer it with the vocals overall but I LOVE the production a lot. 

P.S. - the official instrumentals (with backing vocals) from Self-Titled to reputation are available on streaming as “karaoke” albums. I do recommend searching YouTube for the instrumentals if you want to hear just the production.

"*We keep quiet ‘cause we’re dead if they knew / So close your eyes / Escape this town for a little while*


This mysterious description of Taylor and her muse’s late-night meetup has always been one of my favorite parts of the song ‘Love Story’. I enjoy imagining them trying to camouflage themselves in the garden. What I really love is hearing Taylor imply that - just by closing their eyes in her presence - her lover can escape their oppressive town. She doesn’t say that they kiss in the garden, but the order to ‘close your eyes’ paired with the passionate love shared between the teens makes it safe to assume. What I find the most beautiful about this verse is how Taylor inadvertently describes a kiss as a mode of transportation. The (assumed) kiss is a getaway car. It sweeps lovers into the skies, where family feuds and county lines are imperceivable.

"I'm a newborn gaylor, but honestly, I love having the ability to talk with people about this, read theories, and whatnot. Regular swifties are manic and honestly full of shit, especially considering how they find it crazy that there are people who theorize about Taylor being bi/a lesbian, meanwhile, they are possessive of her and literally send threats (this is mainly aimed at the twitter swifties) to anyone who doesn't believe in what they believe.

I've always seen people say that Taylor was in the closet and I honestly paid it no mind. I actually never cared for her music, probably because I was only exposed to the ""mainstream"" stuff such as 22, Wildest Dreams, Blank Space. When I started actually listening to her music I became almost addicted because of the recurring theme of forbidden love and longing. I thought to myself, **""um, who has she dated long enough to even feel this way??""** Joe is her longest relationship, is he not? Anyway, I know some people fall fast and hard, but the songs seemed to be filled with a lot of emotion for example, ""This Love"".

Idk if there are any Luther Vandross listeners here, but his music had a certain kind of longing/forbidden love element that I hear in a lot of Taylor's music. If you aren't familiar with him, then all you have to know is that he was a singer and it was basically an open secret that he was closeted.

&#x200B;

Anyway, I wrote this to say that none of you are crazy, just observant. I remember thinking Kerry Washington and Tony Goldwyn were a secret item back in 2014. I remember getting so much flack for it too, and fast forward years later, there's a viral post every other day with people also saying the same thing and posting the same evidence that convinced me at first.

"I was listening to Champagne Problems and I noticed Taylor changes the pronouns of this sentence between the first and last chorus:

>your mom's ring in your pocket  
>  
>my picture in your wallet

and then:

>your mom's ring in your pocket  
>  
>her picture in your wallet

Is it meant to show that the guy has moved on and the last chorus happens in the future (where he's asking another girl to marry him)?

"I’ve been going through a devastating heartbreak over the past year and listening to Taylor Swift music has practically been my therapy haha. I went through a Better Man, ATW10MV, august, right where you left me, happiness phase for a long time

The past couple months I’m in more of a WCS phase and listen to it all the time, but am struggling to find any other similar songs and don’t want to repeat WCS so many times that I get bored of it(though it hasn’t happened yet lmao). I like mad woman too because it also has the fuck you element but it’s not the same. WCS encompasses such a uniquely specific emotion- the betrayal and the sadness and the loss of innocence and the how could you and the I cannot let this go type of rage. It’s not just a I hate my ex song. It’s a fuck you for what you did and the parts of me I lost to you 

For context, I was ghosted by someone I was seeing for 3 years who I lost both my physical and emotional innocence to. Any recs would be great- Taylor or non-Taylor songs!!

However, the recent New Jersey event at Jack’s wedding immediately reminded me of incidents like John Lennon's and Christina Grimmie's. Their lives were tragically taken by none other than fans. People who share her location online seem to overlook the existence of psychopaths, which increases the risk of an unstable individual showing up with harmful intent. That genuinely worries me.

"I am very scared to write this down because whenever I said I dont think RED is a very good album, I kept getting shut down by my Swiftie friends.   
I never think RED was the best album of hers. I dont know the hype and rage of all my fellow Swiftie friends saying Red deserved AOTY or Red was cheated off AOTY. 

*That is just my own opinion.* I never felt RED was AOTY material. Even with many listens, RED album songs never made an impression on me. I mean, I do have songs I like, and as a hardcore Swiftie, I love most of the songs on RED. But it's not an album I feel passionately about and whenever I see someone new in the fandom and people hyping the new fan up with how great RED was, I never saw the hype and usually other fans hype it up sooo much to the point when new fans hear it, they just go... *its not* ***that*** *impressive.*

**I have always preferred the actual AOTY 1989 or Fearless over RED album.** 

Don't get me wrong, I love RED but I don't think its as underrated as everyone says it is. I think it's exactly how it is rated, **not** an album of the year album.

 In case you're wondering, my favourite album is Reputation but I also never thought of it as AOTY type. But you don't see many Swifties going around crying about how Rep deserves AOTY or how it was underrated etc. *And Reputation was completely snubbed by the Grammys. wth.*

I was a Swiftie since Fearless Era, and I never vibed with RED as a whole Album. But when I listened to 1989, I went, ***this is it. This is the AOTY.***

Am I the only one in the fandom that thinks that Red is too ***overrated*** within the fandom?",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/1168t8b/unpopular_opinion_red_album_is_overrated/,Unpopular Opinion.

"After listening to champagne problems for the millionth time, I have some thoughts I need to put on paper. Obviously there’s a tl;dr the bottom. :)

For the purposes of this post I’m assuming the narrator is a woman and her significant other is a man. 

We know the narrator rejects a marriage proposal and most of us believe that she’s dealing with mental health issues. However, I don’t believe there’s necessarily a causal relationship between the two. I think the song is her effort to provide the actual explanation – and I think she succeeds when you read between the lines.

In my view, she rejects him because they are fundamentally different people, and she doesn’t feel supported by him, nor his entourage. I think they’re both struggling with mental health issues – or champagne problems – but they couldn’t be more different in the way they address those. 

Let’s start with the first lines of the first two verses. *You booked the night train for a reason* and *You told your family for a reason*. Her significant other seems to need a reason for everything they do, whereas our narrator cannot provide a reason for rejecting the proposal. I think this points to a fundamental difference between the two – he is clear-headed; she feels deeply. He involves everyone; she keeps to herself. He doesn’t fully recognize those differences between them. So when she stays silent, he believes things to be alright. 

Throughout the song, we learn that he has jumped the gun. He brought Dom Pérignon and he prepared a speech, fully expecting her to accept the proposal. However, *love slipped beyond his reaches* and eventually he’s begging on his knees. The person who believed everything was under control, is completely blindsided, because he never understood how she actually feels. About anything. He’s communicating with everyone – friends, family – but not with her. 

Had he done so, he might have learned that she doesn’t see herself in the life he has envisioned for them. I believe she always carried doubts about their relationship and she never felt fully accepted by his friends.

**[Verse 2]**

You told your family for a reason 

You couldn't keep it in 

Your sister splashed out on the bottle 

Now no one's celebrating

**[Chorus]**

Dom Pérignon, you brought it 

No crowd of friends applauded 

Your hometown skeptics called it 

Champagne problems

In verse 2, we learn that his sister bought (and/or opened) an expensive bottle to celebrate the upcoming engagement. In the chorus, however, *he* was the one to bring the champagne. This leads me to believe that these are two completely different scenes, and the latter took place way earlier, when he was breaking the news of his planned proposal to his friends. He already brought Dom Pérignon, obtuse as he is, because he didn’t see any way the proposal could go wrong. 

However, his friends didn’t applaud. They didn’t support the engagement. Instead, they *called* that things would go awry. He then had a bottle of champagne that no-one wanted to drink from: champagne problems. Also, the double meaning of the word ‘called’ is obvious. His hometown skeptics believed her to be unstable due to her ‘champagne problems’. This is why they believed they could foresee what would happen.  

**[Bridge]** 

Your Midas touch on the Chevy door 

November flush and your flannel cure 

""This dorm was once a madhouse"" 

I made a joke, ""Well, it's made for me"" 

How evergreen, our group of friends 

Don't think we'll say that word again 

And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls

That we once walked through

One for the money, two for the show 

I never was ready so I watch you go 

Sometimes you just don't know the answer 

'Til someone's on their knees and asks you 

""She would've made such a lovely bride

What a shame she's fucked in the head,"" they said 

But you'll find the real thing instead 

She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred

In the bridge, the narrator says *how evergreen, our group of friends. Don't think we'll say that word again*. I believe that by adding the word *how*, Taylor is signaling that the narrator is being ironic. Oh, how evergreen they are. She doesn’t believe these friends to be evergreen at all. On the contrary, she never actually considered them friends, she will never see them again and she believes that he will part ways with them too. Because, in time, he will realize that they never supported the relationship. He will see that even though he still loves her, they keep disparaging her (*“What a shame she's fucked in the head,"" they said*). They will have the nerve to deck the halls, perhaps to celebrate Christmas (right after November) and not care a single bit for the one person that isn’t present. Meanwhile, he can’t think of anything else. She knows that it will take way more time for him to move on, and he’s not getting the emotional support he needs from his so-called friends. 

This is why I believe *friends* to be the word that both of them will never say again. 
 
Despite ending the song by saying *you won't remember all my champagne problems*, the narrator leaves plenty of clues that he also suffers from champagne problems. The first chorus describes how vulnerable he is (*your heart was glass*), the last chorus literally states that his future significant other will *not* leave him with champagne problems, meaning that he has them now. One could also argue that literally begging someone to stay with you, on both your knees, signals massive separation anxiety as well. It appears that he ignores every red flag in sight and is determined to bulldoze through his problems. 

The narrator draws a contrast between his Midas touch on the Chevy door and his flannel cure when November comes around.

I believe the lines about the Midas touch and the flannel cure underscore how he is concerned with optics. He wants to maintain the illusion that everything is okay, without doing the hard work of communicating that is necessary. He cares that his car is golden, but when times get tough – November signifies a change of the seasons, the cold coming in - he provides only a flannel cure. *Genius* says: “In keeping with folklore and evermore’s incorporation of folk traditions, wearing red flannel is a folk remedy for back pain – in Victorian times, flannel was worn because it was believed to be protective against colds and during hard winters. The mention of this superstition may imply that the singer’s lover believed in baseless cures for her mental illness that didn’t really work. Swift is also seen wearing a red flannel sweater in the cover and booklet photos for evermore, in reference to this line.”

Many of us subscribe to the belief that the flannel cure is about him handing over his jacket when it’s cold. Nice as it may sound, I don’t believe this to be the case. It doesn’t fit in the song at all; nowhere else does she talk about his redeeming qualities. I actually think she has slowly grown to resent him and she only fully realizes that when he is on his knees, begging her to stay. 

**Tl;dr** - She slowly started to resent him throughout their relationship, due to his inability to communicate and properly address their mental wellbeing. She didn’t feel truly accepted by his friends. He never bothered to ask how she actually felt and learned the hard way.

I fully understand that there are different interpretations of this song. I myself have held plenty of different ones throughout the years.

I saw a post here recently about how she does her clean lyrics by changing the line to something equally (or more) significant. I LOVE the song “the 1” but that seems to be the one song I can’t find a clean version for? I just want to know what she says instead of “I’m on some new shit” which I absolutely love that line but I’m curious. I’ve spent the last 20 minutes looking at videos and websites and the only ones I can find simply silence the word shit and I was hoping she did something more creative than that. Did she?

"Basically the title! I was just listening to Hoax and realized I’d definitely be really surprised if she opted to play it as a surprise song since it isn’t really a fan favorite. It’s not hated much either but it just gets zero publicity basically, which is why I would be surprised if she ever picked it! 

I also know people were stunned to hear she sang IDWLF at the Chicago shows. 

So it got me wondering…which songs would make y’all super surprised if they were picked/would be more unexpected? I think Hoax and maybe Superstar. Also sadder ones like SYGB or BTTWS but I think that goes without saying! 

Can’t wait to hear people’s thoughts.

Edit: Also goes without saying that she likely won’t play anything unreleased (YLM, I’d Lie, etc).",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/143k956/what_are_songs_that_youd_be_genuinely_surprised/,What are songs that you’d be genuinely surprised if Taylor played them for surprise songs?,TaylorSwift,t3_143k956,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/143k956/what_are_songs_that_youd_be_genuinely_surprised/,2023-06-07 18:02:31,Taylor Swift,0.21508642

For example, I have to keep reminding myself that other people can like WCS. I have an emotional attachment to that song because of personal experiences and whenever I come across another person who’s favorite song is WCS, I have to stop myself from thinking, “they probably don’t even like it that much.”

"What do y'all think will be BE3 main theme and message? With red being basically the main assumption of color for this album, I think it'll be pretty intense, sexy and dark (in the literal sense, I expect some MVS, like NDA, recorded during night), and pretty personal (as she already said before), so I think there will definitely be songs with lyrics about her career so far, fans obsession over her past relationships, etc. And I think it'll make us revisit all past eras, just as she did in the Barbie MV.

For the main genre, I think it'll be kinda of mixed? Not 100% rock as people are saying, I don't think Billie would get rid of her pop vibes (she can though). It may be kinda of an alt-rock, just as AM from Artic Monkeys.",https://www.reddit.com/r/billieeilish/comments/17wvvqq/be3_main_theme/,BE3 main theme,billieeilish,t3_17wvvqq,/r/billieeilish/comments/17wvvqq/be3_main_theme/,2023-11-16 19:58:02,Billie Eilish,0.25915736

"With Speak Now on its way on 7/7, I'm starting to thinking about how I feel about the other re-recordings that we have yet to hear.

On the whole I think they've changed how I listen to Taylor's music generally. I have like (My Version) playlists of Red and Fearless where I've cherry picked which versions of the songs I like best (mostly Taylor's Version but some of the oldies are too near and dear to my heart to toss).

I'm really wondering how Taylor Swift (Taylor's Version) is going to be released and received. I'm worried that since it is an album that people seem to know and like less, Taylor won't put as much effort into the TV of it, knowing how low it is in so many rankings. It's pretty high up on mine so I just hope it has a chance to shine like the others.

Considering it was her first album and recorded when she was in her teens, it's also likely that the TVs will sound the most different from the originals compared to the other re-records. I'm honestly wondering whether I'll like any of them. I'm a fan of Fearless TV and Red TV (mostly) so I'm sure it'll be fine, but it's hard to picture those early songs in her more mature/some would say more skilled voice.

Some songs, like Picture to Burn, I think will translate so well for Taylor now. It's fun, it's catchy, it has attitude. She's going to kill that.

But how about Stay Beautiful? It's so fun but it has a really young baby sprout quality to it. I don't know if I'll 'believe' the TV.

Ultimately of course there's no way to know how it turns out until Taylor Swift releases Taylor Swift (Taylor's Version) and we get to hear it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/13e3nyk/how_are_we_feeling_about_debut_taylors_version/,How are we feeling about Debut Taylor's Version?,TaylorSwift,t3_13e3nyk,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/13e3nyk/how_are_we_feeling_about_debut_taylors_version/,2023-05-10 21:20:48,Taylor Swift,0.10609736

"Ok stay with me 😂 I know this is a VERY silly reference, but I believe it may be a tiny Easter egg that was expected to hatch this year (but got delayed due to writers strike). I'm sure the imagery has multiple meanings to the oh so powerful miss swift, but wanted to share!

Lavender Haze seems to reference this scene in Muppets in Space.
https://youtu.be/qd2WM8tQuzc?t=1m40s

After flying through a (lavender haze) cloud in space, two self-proclaimed ""cosmic knowledge fish"" approach gonzo to say ""your people have been trying to reach you"" and tell him that he needs to CREATE A MESSAGE SO BIG IT CAN BE SEEN FROM SPACE. (This could possibly be a nod back to the possible dismantling of the music industry going on behind the scenes).


Now for the potential Easter egg! There is a new muppets show called Muppets Mayhem, which hosts musicians each episode to play with the muppets Electric Mayhem band.

Here is a trailer: 
https://youtu.be/HhP4QiK8GzA

Season 2 was delayed due to writers strike. Maybe Taylor will be featured in an upcoming episode ?! We know she has more to deliver for her Disney+ contract started in 2020. But all the weird MAYHEM clues that never shook out, plus this other muppets reference. Would be super fun to see her on a children's show (as her acting could actually live up to expectations there lol).",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/17nl869,Muppets Mayhem / Lav Haze,Gaylor_Swift,t3_17nl869,/r/Gaylor_Swift/comments/17nl869/muppets_mayhem_lav_haze/,2023-11-04 13:03:37,Taylor Swift,0.2648175

"On tiktok, twitter, and youtube shorts, I keep seeing “ASAP” constantly be referred to as a disappointment or underwhelming. I keep seeing people constantly rate it in last place when comparing the other track on the album.

I just wanted to say y’all don’t understand ASAP like I do. Like let her marinate a little if you need to understand it more. 

I loved her upon first listen. The minimalist beat. The calming sensation. The chillax vibe. The anxiety reducing tempo. ASAP is a fantastic song that y’all are too critical about.

"I’ve read quite a few comments about ATW. I especially loved going to the YouTube Video versions. 

I’m a newbie AND I’m an oldie at 69. So please be kind. I didn’t even know there was a shorter version when I first heard ATW. That’s how new I am. 

I suppose it’s the song that put me firmly in the Swifie camp. Until then, I mostly was “meh.” When I heard ATW, I knew she was exceptionally talented. There’s a whole lotta people that can write sad songs. 

But she put the exact feeling a loving relationship cut short feels like. And usually, look, I’m old now. How on earth could a 21 year old get the depth?

My first indication was than in 90 very short days, *within days* she visited his sister. I wasn’t very good with romantic clues back in my day. But dayum, she’s already meeting the sister? Dear old mom has the family album out? Telling stories about her son to a girl friend isn’t usually a casual visit EVER. 

She may have only been 20/21, but she totally knew all to well that this one could been THE one. 

My favorite line is about the punchline/joke. To know that he’s going to date more very young woman cuts me right in two. 

I have images of the photo album on the family’s kitchen counter. Everyone being happy to share his childhood. I have visions of her day saying she’s supposed to be happy turning 21. 

This is my favorite Swift song. I listen to it at least once per day but more often much more.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/16ldafx/all_too_well/,All too well,TaylorSwift,t3_16ldafx,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/16ldafx/all_too_well/,2023-09-17 21:50:30,Taylor Swift,0.13908891

"I've seen a lot of incorrect stuff cited about Joe in the wake of the breakup so I thought I'd clear up some things.

I'm using this timeline for sources, so click on the relevant year for each debunk (so rep tour - look at 2018 etc). I highly recommend reading through it for a much clearer/realistic idea of how things panned out. Fan speculation relies so much on what's publicly and loudly visible, and often timeframes are just completely wrong.

[https://youareinlovees.tumblr.com/post/619261028287578112/taylor-and-joe-timeline-2016-2017-2018-2019-part](https://youareinlovees.tumblr.com/post/619261028287578112/taylor-and-joe-timeline-2016-2017-2018-2019-part)

*""He only attended one Reputation Tour show"":* **FALSE.** He attended at least five publicly and we don't know how many he may have been backstage for. 

*""He never protected Taylor from the paparazzi"":* **FALSE.** Here is [a video](https://64.media.tumblr.com/bb454161f17a1f83444b499fff1be4e7/7e2fd5cc0ae281d1-b4/s1280x1920/7b677d219d52c3fea2772d0a059841d9af5ed757.gifv) clearly showing him using his own body as a barrier for her against the paps. 

*""He never attended any special events with her"":* **FALSE.** They very publicly attended the 2020 Golden Globes together and were shown on camera several times. They also attended the NME Awards together not long after. Way back in 2017, he was standing in the audience with her at Jingle Ball watching other performances. And again, just because we didn't see them together at an event, doesn't mean they didn't attend together. Taylor has also never walked a red carpet with any partner. 

*""He never supported her""*: **FALSE.** Toward the end perhaps, but throughout, there were many instances of him showing her support. When asked about breaking her political silence in 2018, he said ""It's great, I think it's important"" before being rushed away by a publicist. She also cited him as one of the people who helped her become more openly political: *""I found myself talking about government and the presidency and policy with my boyfriend, who supported me in speaking out.""*

*""They never went out in public together"":* **FALSE.** Again, just look through any year of the timeline links post May 2017, and there are tons of paparazzi pics of them out and about. Even when they weren't publicly known to be dating yet, she was still seeing his movies and they were navigating a social life. 2019 was almost as public as Travis just without Joe talking to press or on a podcast. And as Taylor just clarified, she managed to date Travis out of sight for almost two months before she publicly attended a football game for the first time.

*""Tolerate It is about Joe"":* **Leaning toward false.** She may have been experiencing aspects of what the song addresses, but the song was written in early 2020 and, as I've shown, they seemed to be in a good space during that time. There's also the ""so much older"" lyric and the lose weight lyric which is why I think the song pertains more to Calvin (as he was older and her weight was at its worst when they were dating).

*""Bejeweled is about Joe"":* **Unlikely.** Again, Bejeweled brings up many similar themes to Tolerate It and the album is (largely) about reflecting on past relationships/sleepless nights. I think it's more of an awful coincidence that it appears to have suited Joe so well in the end too.

*""Midnights is a break up album/She and Joe were pretending to still be together"":* **Not as simple as that.** Midnights was confirmed to have been largely written and recorded in November 2021. Now we know Taylor also wrote and recorded You're Losing Me in December 2021 (she also released Renegade in July 2021). Does that suggest major issues? Of course. But they also did not break up for another 1.5 years. They were caught kissing by the paparazzi 6 months after she recorded You're Losing Me, and he was at her Grammys afterparty in February 2023. Ryan Reynolds wrote a positive piece about him for Time magazine in September 2022. Joe liked Taylor's Eras rehearsal post on IG just weeks before they ended it. They either had or were close to buying an 8 million dollar house. He was still very much part of her life until March 2023. None of the cracks in their relationship are public, aside from the insight she allows in her lyrics.

My only guess is that his not showing to Eras was too big to overcome. After 6 months rigorous training, after relocating throughout 2021 to various places for him while he filmed, after including him in her creative process during quarantine, and whatever else, perhaps it was too much to have him just not even show up, or perhaps not even plan to show up anytime soon once the tour began. I can only speculate but to say they were always bad or he was always absent or they never had anything good is still plain wrong.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/18dgor5/clarifying_some_joe_revisionist_history/,Clarifying some Joe revisionist history,TaylorSwift,t3_18dgor5,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/18dgor5/clarifying_some_joe_revisionist_history/,2023-12-08 06:30:01,Taylor Swift,0.09828771

That being said, I have had 8 favorite albums. Fearless, Speak Now, 1989, Reputation, Lover, folklore, evermore, and Midnights.

The first album that made me a Swiftie was Lover. Then I kinda fell in love with the earlier stuff. SN and Fearless. I love Red, but it never topped SN and F for me. Then I found Rep & 1989, the two hitting me equally hard depending on what mood I was in. As I got depressed during covid time f & e helped me so much. Midnights was the pinnacle of the right album at the right time, coming out when I felt the best I ever have in life.

"I am so grateful for their friendship and collaboration. Apart from the Anti Hero ft Bleachers remix, I'd like to hear their voices together. After listening to the 1989 TV vault tracks and recognizing Jack's voice in various portions, I started thinking of other songs where Jack has added his vocals:

now that we don't talk (right at the last line)

out of the woods (him doing the repetition and the OH's)

labyrinth (intro)

is it over now? (intro)

getaway car (end of chorus harmony)

call it what you want (the outro)

paper rings (the countdown to the chorus)

cruel summer (maybe it's just Taylor's voice pitched down but in the verse there's a phrase being repeated between lines)

These are simply my thoughts on where I believe it could be Jack's voice; what do you think?

"I seriously was under the impression she was really well known internationally. Up until I saw a post about her not charting well in France and I was confused, then I see she didn't do as well in some other countries such as Italy and Russia. I searched for other artists such as Lady Gaga, Shakira, The Weeknd, Billie Eilish, Dua Lipa, and even Olivia Rodrigo and they were much higher in both certifications (have more platinum) and the charts. This did leave me confused. What's going on with Taylor? Why is she relatively lesser known than other artists and if the sources were reliable to measure all the artists popularity (yes, I searched in Wikipedia).

The only reason I'm asking this is that I like to look on cultural reactions and understanding. I've been interested in it and I want to know your answers.

And I don't think it's stopping anytime soon, unless she decides to stop dropping new music/content and retire.

You can upload images to Imgur and share the link in a comment on this post. **THIS ALSO APPLIES TO TRADE OFFERS. Comment with a photo of your item you are offering to trade before private messaging.**
   * Any very RARE items should have a photo with a handwritten timestamp (your Reddit username and the date handwritten on a piece of paper).
   * i.e. ""Record Store Days"" Vinyl Records, 'Lover' Snow Globe, Signed Items, and Lithographs
* If you are interested in a sale or trade, comment ""Sent a private message to you. I accept your listed price or I have X item to trade"" so the moderator(s) know who is reaching out to who.
* No ""Taking offers"" comments - **Items being sold must have a clear price**. If anyone tries to sell something to you ABOVE their listed price - please let the moderators know.
   * If you want to negotiate a lower price or offer something else that is not an ISO, please do so in the comments first.
   * Insane price gouging is not allowed.
   * If you are unsure about the value of an item, feel free to make a post with the ""Fair Trade/Value Question"" flair.
* ***Please edit your comment once you've accepted an offer and tag the user you are selling or trading to.***

"Whether or not Rep is an album you frequently listen to, I think we can all agree that it was and is just *that album*. The vibes will forever be iconic. Lately, I’ve been grasping the long-awaited rerelease and it has me thinking about what I’d actually prefer to hear. When I listen to Rep it’s because I’m seeking out the girl boss energy other albums are sort of missing. It would be mind-blowing if she gives us more of those vibes on the vault tracks, but I find myself shocked to say that I’d like to hear more of the softer tracks like Delicate &amp; New Year’s Day that didn't make it the first time around.

"So we know that Joe was just messing about on the piano one day and happened upon the ‘fully formed chorus of Betty,’ leading Taylor to be…. entranced. 

We also know that the stories told in Betty and Cardigan are explicitly interwoven. 

We have *high heels on cobblestones* 
And *I was walking home on broken cobblestones*

*standing in your cardigan, kissing in my car again* and *to kiss is cars and downtown bars was all we needed*

Also there is Cardigan’s *and you’d be standing in my front porch light* with *Betty I’m here on your door step…*

Well, the other day I was thinking about the link in Betty’s chorus with *I’m only 17, I don’t know anything, but I know I miss you*
And the repeated line in cardigan *When you are young they assume you know nothing.*

I may be mistaken but I believe Cardigan was one of the first songs Taylor wrote for Folklore? The line ‘when you are young they assume you know nothing’ is also in her original demo to Aaron. 

 If Joe did indeed write Betty’s chorus, then he must have wrote the line in Betty that perfectly connects to Taylor’s line in Cardigan. Can’t have been a coincidence… or was Joe inspired by Taylor? I somehow doubt it. These two songs connect and tell a story. And it seems likely to me that Taylor wrote Betty on her own, presumably with inspiration from Cardigan.

"Or is it, like this article claims, a fake relationship?

I mean, I don’t think it is fake. I just don’t quite get the “in your face-ness” of it, compared to her very quiet last relationship. I mean, she can be out and proud about, but in my experience usually celebrities only do that when they have a reason or something to promote. But I’m cynical. 

Any thoughts? Is there something I’m missing that is making her so pro-publicity right now? Is it him? As a football fan, can we just go one Sunday without everyone talking about her? 😂

"i know the song has a lot of meanings and interpretations, but to me it’s always meant  when i was a teenager and trying to impress a crush/keep them interested in you. when you have someone you really like and they may like you too a little, but you just have to fight to get their attention as you know their feelings are fickle and they’re probably looking at many other people. someone has probably already talked about this but oh well

“I know they said the end is near”

Like it is clear that they might be losing interest in you, maybe your friends are telling you to move on and stop chasing them.

“But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes, Spinning in my highest heels, love. Shining just for you” 

But you still have hope that it will work out, so you stand tall to grasp for their attention. For example, maybe wearing a cute outfit to see if they’ll notice, or posting pretty pictures of yourself in hopes that they’ll like them. You’re just shining for them, youre doing all of this for them, and only want their attention. 

“I can change everything about me to fit in”

When you change yourself around this crush. You may talk differently, change your appearance, etc..

“And they called off the circus…sent home the horses and the rodeo clowns.“

When there are more clear signs that their attraction for you is fading/gone.

“I'm still on that tightrope
I'm still trying everything to get you laughing at me/ I'm still on that trapeze, I'm still trying everything to keep you looking at me”

But you still refuse to give up, you put in more effort to shine for them, to get them to notice you, grasping for their attention.

“I'm still a believer but I don't know why, I've never been a natural all I do is try, try, try.”

When things are so clear but for some reason you still have false hope for a perfect ending, but honestly you don’t even know why you’re believing in it when all signs point to nothing. You know they would never like your natural personality, so you keep
trying  to change yourself for them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/14qkla8/mirrorball_interpretation_about_a_teenage_crush/,mirrorball interpretation about a teenage crush,TaylorSwift,t3_14qkla8,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/14qkla8/mirrorball_interpretation_about_a_teenage_crush/,2023-07-04 16:57:02,Taylor Swift,0.1373533

I watched him for a while now, and everybody seems to be having a discussion if Olivia and Taylor have a feud or not. So, I decides to share this and see your opinions, assuming that anyone is interested in seeing this video.

Additional information: He says that Olivia alienated herself and she learning the hard way because she overplayed her hand. She also didn't realize how much an impact Taylor is and Swift going after her whatever the case may be, she’s shunned from a lot of people and going to be ice out because of this feud. He also believes that Olivia deserves to be copyrighted because she stole Taylor Swift and Paramore music.

Verse 2: I've been running from the past Trying to leave it all behind But it's a part of who I am And it's hard to let it go

Chorus: 'Cause I'm a blank space, baby Just looking for a story to write I'm a blank space, baby Just looking for a place to shine

Bridge: I'll be the one to light the fire And I'll be the one to make you smile I'll be the one to hold you tight And I'll be the one to stay awhile

"Oh, hi everyone, it's good to be back after so long haha. If you've been on this site for at least 8 months, you might remember a post with the same theme, asking what's the best Taylor song with ""The..."" in the title. I'll leave a link for those who are curious:

&#x200B;

[https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorGamesWannaPlay/comments/11d0jyg/which\_is\_the\_best\_and\_the\_worst\_taylor\_swift\_song/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorGamesWannaPlay/comments/11d0jyg/which_is_the_best_and_the_worst_taylor_swift_song/)

&#x200B;

And this time, the game will be very similar, except that now you'll have to **choose your favorite** (and **least favorite**) song that has ""... **You** ..."" in the title.

And considering that this time we have a lot more options (and also a lot of fan favorites), I'm going to be nice and let you choose **TWO** from your favorites and least favorites. (You can choose just one if you want, but take the chance to favor more than one song you like)

Well then, here's the **form** for you to vote:

Fun fact: Folklore is the only album that doesn't have a single song with ""You"" in the title. Even Taylor's Christmas EP has a ""you"" song in it.

"Hey everyone!


Penelope here, back with another round of Four Corners! (Or Four Corners 2.0... I re-recorded it 💀). If you're wondering ""why am i getting deja vu?"" or thinking to yourself ""penelope you dumbass, you already did this."" YOU'RE RIGHT BUT you can go back to [MYLASTPOST](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/12kyyi9/fearless_four_corners_20/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) and see the explanation. Or just know that *this love is alive back from the dead.* Anyway, thank you so much to everyone who came back and decided to *Back to December* and do this again with me :') it really reminds me that there are *still beautiful things*. LOL seriously, thank you. It's been so much fun and I can't wait to keep going! Let's get onto explaining the game:


# What Is Four Corners? 


Four Corners is a game where you focus on one of Taylor's albums and choose up to four songs to divide up into four opposing categories. Imagine these categories as the Four Corners in a grid. Today we'll be focusing on Speak Now, as the post title suggests. You'll be choosing the song that best fits each of these descriptions:


*BEST: A song that is YOUR PERSONAL FAVORITE off the album, unaffected by its general ranking by the fan base.*


*OVERRATED: A song that u feel is THE MOST OVERRATED by the fan base, whether you consider it one of the best songs or one of the worst songs off the album.*


*UNDERRATED: A song that u feel is THE MOST UNDERRATED by the fan base, whether you consider it one of the best songs or one of the worst songs off the album.*


*WORST: A song that is your PERSONAL LEAST FAVORITE off the album, unaffected by its general ranking by the fan base.*


With that all said, I guess *it's time to go-* okay okay I'll stop. It's time to go onto the results from the last round of Four Corners! It's interesting, I didn't know if it would be stupid to do this again, but I figured I'd get different participants this time, so other people could play. But just as I was last time, I was surprised that even though many of you came back, the results have changed... I'll be listing both the old and new results. 


*BEST SONG: FEARLESS!!!!* The way I squealed when I realized Fearless won the title of the best off of its eponymous album. With 5.5 votes, the general public seemed to agree with me that *it's flawless, really something...* The previous winner for the original post was The Way I Loved You. Fearless has a smooth melody, descriptive storyline, and an unbeatable boost of euphoria. So, in my humble opinion, *I don't know how it gets better than this.* ;) 


*MOST OVERRATED SONG: LOVE STORY* Although a lot of us can agree that *we were both young when we first* heard this song, unfortunately, nostalgia wasn't enough to save it. In the original post i made last year, it narrowly escaped the title to You Belong With Me. This time 8 of the 20 voters agreeing to *just say ""yes""* to crowning this infamous, inescapable song the unfortunate title of most overrated. Sorry, Love Story. Can't say I didn't agree with them, but I still love you. 


*MOST UNDERRATED SONG: SUPERSTAR*. To my absolute shock, Superstar narrowly took the title of most underrated track with only 4.5 votes. The votes were incredibly divided, with a lot of songs getting at least one nomination. Yet, only one song could take the title, and it seems you all told it things like *""I can't keep my eyes off of you.""* Last time, the winner was Breathe, but I guess the sweet sense of longing was enough to sway the vote this time.


*WORST SONG: TIED (!!!) SUPERSTAR AND COME IN THE WITH RAIN.* For the first time in the history of this game, there was a tie. With 6 votes each, Superstar and Come In With The Rain both shared the dishonorable title of worst song off of Fearless. Superstar, which was the sole loser (by a landslide) during the original round, was once again deemed *""no one special""*. This time, however... *sigh*, Come In With The Rain was cursed the same fate. After seeing what y'all wrote about it, *I'm too tired at night for all these games.* 💀.


Anyway, that all out of the way, let's get onto the final part of this post: the rules! I'll say, there aren't too many rules, but there are a few. Please note that, while every single response is deeply appreciated (I mean that!), only ones that follow every rule will be counted towards the tally at the end. These rules for the actual tally are as follows: 


- You must try to answer all four questions 


- Vault songs (if out), unreleased, and off album songs (e.g. Let's Go Battle, Eyes Open) are NOT included! The only songs that are included are the original and deluxe tracks.


- If you pick 2 songs/ tie for the category, your vote will be split between the two. 


So that's it! I wanted to thank you all for participating in these posts, it really means so much and I want you all to know that. I know it sounds silly, but reading these comments puts such a smile on my face. I hope you all have a great day/night, and I hope you have fun playing Four Corners!


-Penelope

"Hello from me and u/impla77 and welcome to the robbed magnum opuses rate!

This month we are going to be revisiting several albums that have become more quintessential since they were first rated. All four of these albums were first rated on popheads nearly a decade ago. Back then we couldn’t have known that what looked like the height of Beyonce’s power was in the middle of inventing a whole new tier of fame or that SZA would ride the wave of her debut album for five years all the way to stardom or that Frank and Rihanna would literally never release another song ever again. But now that we know it feels like a fine time to revisit these pivotal moments in not just these artists careers, but in pop music as a whole.

**SZA - CTRL (Deluxe)**

Original rate: [The Female R&B Debut Rate: Aquarius vs CTRL vs SweetSexySavage](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/7affsn/rate_the_female_rb_debut_rate_aquarius_vs_ctrl_vs/)


>You’ll never love me
>
>But I believe it when you say it like dat

CTRL, SZA’s highly anticipated debut album, is a brutally frank reflection on relationships: the good (or what passes as good enough), the bad and frequently, the dramatic. The stream of consciousness lyrics provide an intimate, and at times uncomfortable, look into SZA’s mind, as she battles topics from being a side piece to unstable self worth to the anxieties of aging. Paired with impeccable production and big name features, it seems CTRL was destined to become a modern classic from the outset. This has been reflected in its staggering critical and commercial success. In fact, it is the 2nd longest charting R&B album in Billboard history, beaten out only by another rate participant, Anti.
 
The maxim ‘good things come to those who wait’ should be a mantra for fans of SZA, as CTRL Deluxe was released 5 years AFTER the original CTRL. We are taking this rate as an opportunity to also rate the deluxe tracks that were nowhere close to being released during its original rate (lol).

As the only non 2016 release, and as a debut album against much more established artists, we shall have to see how CTRL stacks up against these three other titans.

**Beyoncé - Lemonade**

Original rate: [The 2016 Ultimate Album Rate: Anti vs. Lemonade vs. Joanne vs. Glory](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/5lf5pq/rate_the_2016_ultimate_album_rate_anti_vs/)




>Okay ladies now let’s get in formation
>
>Prove to me you got some coordination

It shows how prolific an artist Beyoncé is in that it might be quite controversial to label her 2016 masterpiece Lemonade as her magnum opus. Undeniably a cultural juggernaut, and quite possibly THE album of 2016, Beyoncé stunned with performance after performance. Lemonade tells the story of a woman processing infidelity, from denial and rage to forgiveness and redemption. That the woman scorned is the seemingly infallible Queen Bey does not detract from the raw emotion expressed throughout the album. Along with the accompanying film, Lemonade tells a wider story of generational curses, the empowerment of black women and of course, making lemonade out of lemons. 

 From her intimate, turning point album ‘4’, to the mother of all surprise albums ‘BEYONCÉ’ and onwards to last years black queer trailblazers celebration ‘RENAISSANCE’, Beyoncé sure has quite a few potential magnum opuses, but Lemonade lacks something the aforementioned albums have- a rate win. Can she extend her lead on the total amount of rates won with this rate?

**Frank Ocean - Blond**

Original rate: [The Life of Pablo vs. Views vs. Coloring Book vs. Blonde](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/5fuxsj/rate_the_life_of_pablo_vs_views_vs_coloring_book/)

>I’m sure we’re taller in another dimension

>you say we’re small and not worth the mention


To call Blond Frank Ocean's magnum opus is perhaps underselling it a little. Blond is more than just a really good album. It’s one of the best put together r&b albums ever made. It was a complete trajectory change in mainstream r&b. It’s one of the most influential pop albums of the 2010’s. It’s your favorite artist's favorite album. And it’s aging like fine wine. 

To put it simply, blonde is about nostalgia and duality. But simple does not even begin to do it justice. It’s a dense journey through many different facets of Franks experience as a young queer black man. Each song tells a different story about love and loss and youth and sex and how it all intertwines. And it doesn't even just stop with the lyrics. The soft and introspective instrumentation, the sometimes abnormal song structures, and the features and voice notes all further the themes and meanings in their own unique ways. It’s all expansive and raw and just so sincere. 

As the only man in the rate and with the least accessible sound we will have to see if his magnum opus performs well or will he refuse to livestream it, show up an hour late, and then dip before day 2?

**Rihanna - Anti (Deluxe):**

Original rate: [The 2016 Ultimate Album Rate: Anti vs. Lemonade vs. Joanne vs. Glory](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/5lf5pq/rate_the_2016_ultimate_album_rate_anti_vs/)

>This whiskey got me feeling pretty

>so pardon if i’m impolite

For anyone else the Anti rollout would have been a career killer. But it wasn’t. Simply because it’s Rihanna. And if anyone is going to kill her career it’s going to be herself. And honestly that’s the real magic of this album. It was an era specifically planned to buck the conventions of pop stardom in favor of something much more abnormal. In fact she turned down nearly an entire album of what will eventually be Sia’s greatest hits just so she could have something unique. And the ironic thing is instead of sticking out everyone just followed her lead. She became more influential than ever. She put on Sza, inspired a good bit of Melodrama and HFK, got Tame Impala to cover her, and solidified trop pop in the mainstream. Rihanna’s presence was felt everywhere. Especially in the places she wasn’t. And more so than she usually used to be. Most impressively she managed to reassert herself in the middle of this transformation. How many artists do you know that release career defining songs on their ~last~ eighth album?

And to top it all off the album is really good. It’s messy and all over the place and that somehow makes it work together. She effortlessly jumps between different genres and moods. It’s a masterclass on riding the line between intimacy and bravado. 

But we all know how great this album is. It’s just a question of is it better than these other three juggernauts. Will Woo finally get the respect it deserves? Will we all be witness to another slumber party?

It makes all of our lives easier for compiling the scores

- Each song can receive a score between 1 and 10, and decimal points up to 1 place are allowed (e.g. 5.5, 7.3, 9.9 - NOT 5.55 or 9.99).

- You are allowed to give one song an 11 and one song a 0 for the entire main rate. You are not required to use these. It is also highly recommended you leave comments for your 11 and 0. You cannot use your 11 or 0 in the separate bonus rate

- Comments should be formatted by commenting after the song without adding anything else. For an example:

>Woo: 11 This is the best song ever made


- You can also leave comments on albums by formatting them like the following (don't forget the colon after the album title)

>Album: blond: wow this album is incredible i hope we get another one sometime soon!


- Please do not format your comments any other way or it will break the rate machine!!!


- If scores are missing, there are multiple 11s/0s, or other such mistakes, you will be notified and your scores will not be counted until they are corrected.


- Comments and scores attached to songs are not confidential and will be shown during the reveal along with your name.


- You are also free to change your comments or scores at any point before the due date! Message either of us (u/franklytheturtle or u/impla77)


- Do not sabotage! We reserve the right to ask you to resubmit your ballot or (in extreme cases) reject the ballot entirely if we think your scores feel off. (If you're unsure, adding comments to songs/albums explaining your reasoning is usually enough to get it accepted.)

"Obviously Taylor Swift has accomplished a huge number of things in the past 17(?) years of her career. My question is, what are things that you believe she will never CHOOSE to do? Not things that you don’t believe she’s capable of accomplishing, but things she won’t try because she just doesn’t want to or doesn’t think it’s a good career move. 

This is kind of random, but last night as my 3.5 year old was watching the Sesame Street 50th anniversary special for the 11th time, I found myself thinking about whether Taylor has ever been on Sesame Street (she has not) and whether she ever would. It feels like most musical performers who go on Sesame Street do so either early in their careers when they’re just starting to get famous (Billie Eilish, Hailee Steinfeld, Destiny’s Child, the Chicks, Feist) or once they’re old enough to have kids who want to watch Sesame Street (Dave Grohl in season 50), or Sesame Street is just an integral part of their upbringing and they jump at the chance to be a part of it. And idk about you guys, but Taylor doesn’t seem like a Sesame Street girlie to me. I could be wrong though!

Anyway, what are your thoughts about things she won’t attempt, for whatever reason? I’m not talking about collaborators she won’t work with, that’s been discussed fairly recently. This is more things like musical styles she won’t write in, cultural moments that she wouldn’t want to be a part of, etc. I also don’t think that we will see her perform at a US presidential inauguration, for example. I checked the tired topics list and I hope this doesn’t count!

"I’m not at all saying Taylor Swift songs are repetitive, but as the saying goes, “and everything is all reused.” 

Have you ever made a connection between two songs from different eras, especially pre/post Red, which is what I designate as the beginning of “adult Taylor”?

1. Sparks Fly, So It Goes, and Question…? all give off the same vibe
2. Cowboy Like Me is Tim McGraw, except they don’t get back together in the end

"I actually think I Forgot That You Existed is a great song, maybe even one of her best glitter gel pen songs. I essentially commented this somewhere else, but I think it deserves its own discussion since I see many people who are dismissive of it. 

Most people who dislike it seem to find it trite, uninspired, or too on the nose. And while these things might appear true superficially, especially when you view it as something of a palate cleanser after the Reputation Era given its placement as the first track on Lover (and it does *expertly* serve this purpose), I do think there's more to it.

I have always thought this song is deeper than people make it out to be. There's a certain wonderful, even euphoric, feeling post-breakup (whether romantic relationship or even friendship--I just went through the latter) when after being consumed by your ex--just thinking about them all the time--you come to realize you haven't thought about them in a while...and now you just don't care! Maybe it's just because I've been through this too many times (haha), but that song really resonates with me. Sure the music is not her deepest, most interesting, nor most original, but what it conveys is *levity and joy*. It perfectly backs the rush that comes with this moment of realization. You've finally found freedom after a tough breakup! And you didn't even notice it! You just kind of slipped into your new life then one day you realized ""Oh hey, I'm over it."" and that feels simply liberating.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/11zmhrm/in_defense_of_i_forgot_that_you_existed/,In defense of I Forgot That You Existed,TaylorSwift,t3_11zmhrm,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/11zmhrm/in_defense_of_i_forgot_that_you_existed/,2023-03-23 14:42:46,Taylor Swift,0.18174082

"Taylor obviously has a “Reputation” of messy breakups and songs about her exes. Because of this, and potentially homophobia for her female romances, she probably hasn’t dated someone who really wanted to have their romance public out. Maybe she wanted privacy with Travis at first because it’s all she knows. Because of the way this whole thing started with him going to the media trying to get her number, it forced the relationship into the spotlight from day one. 

The NFL is a huge entity but it doesn’t mean this relationship is fake. Travis is a huge public personality and comfortable in the public eye. He doesn’t hide his life and probably encouraged her not to hide their relationship either. That’s why this all feels so different to us because she is being loud and proud. I think she’s a hopeless romantic and we are actually seeing who she really is in new relationships. Plus he has macho and totally different than most or everyone she has dated. They are in love for real and the novelty of him being unique to her and not hiding is making her almost burst at the seams. It’s hard to know if this will go the distance because we don’t know what she’s normally like when dating but it seems promising.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Gaylor_Swift/comments/17ukj5l/travis_is_the_first_person_shes_dated_who_doesnt/,Travis is the first person she’s dated who doesn’t mind the publicity and embraces it.

"The other day I made a playlist with my Top 50 (at this point it's more of a top 75) of my favourite Taylor Swift songs but as I was sharing it with my friends, they pointed out that some of them are ""random"".

"*Taxi cabs and busy streets / They never bring you back to me / I can’t help but wish they took me with you*


This makes me think that Taylor was finding connections between her muse and everything in sight. Food was not just food, but it was a way that she could’ve bonded with her muse. The clothes in her closet bring up memories with her muse. And of course, taxi cabs and busy streets are not just parts of living in the city, but tools that could be used to bring her and her muse together. Everything was about her muse, even the things that didn’t have anything to do with them.

"I think that we all know that “You’re On Your Own Kid” is a coming of age song (she also paraphrased some of the words on her NYU speech), but I was listening today and I realized the following lyric reminds me of the TOMG video:

“I wait patiently/He's gonna notice me/It's okay, we're the best of friends/Anyway” 

Teardrops On My Guitar was inspired by a real life scenario of Taylor liking a guy named Drew and how he would talk to her about other girls (like on the vid) and it just hit me like a school bus. I forget if Taylor and the real Drew ever dated? but I thought it was neat. And then she talks about how she found comfort in writing songs. 

“Something different bloomed/Writing in my room”

"For any Rihanna fan we can remember when she first started out. Like any ""pop"" star in the making, you can tell she had a management team/label who ""curated"" her look as a pop star and pretty much watched over all the moves she made. From what she looked like, to what she said in the public eye, how she presented herself, what types of songs she should choose.  She is so different from the Rihanna we see today. More liberated, her evolution of style, taking risks in not only fashion but in music, she's Badgalriri.

When exactly - or what era of Rihanna- do you feel it was that she broke away from under her management/handlers spell who did as she pleased unapologetically and became her own woman? Like you know for a fact that she doesn't have someone watching over her social media and making decisions for her on what to post, etc. She calls the shots and she has been for a long time.

"Bought my wife tickets for Christmas (before the absurd price jumps) as she has been a life long fan.
I'd listen to her and enjoy her songs from time to time, but once meeting my wife she became pretty much a staple in our daily listenings and I found myself becoming a low key Swifty.

Fast forward to the day of the show and I was excited like everyone else, but figured I'd enjoy the show and that would be that.

"I remember during Midnights rollout Taylor made a comment about her “partner of six years” that made me curious. Obviously many took it to mean Joe, but why say “partner”, and not his name? She’s mentioned Joe by name in the past, so when she didn’t this time I felt there must have been a reason. 

Because by phrasing it the way she did she was speaking the truth, but also wording it in a careful way so as to make people assume she meant Joe. 

If people in my life are being nosy about my personal business, I will often say things that are technically true, but misleading. I think this is what she was doing. She’s been with someone since 2016, until at least around this time last year when the comment was made. I think the “six years” comment points to the relationship starting then, as if it was before or after 2016 she could have said “my partner of many years” instead and no one would question it. By 2016 Kaylor had been going on for 2 years, so I don’t think it’s Karlie. Swiftgron had last been seen together 3 years prior, and I have no fucking idea about anything Tily. 

I believe whoever it is, and I do not wish to debate that in this post as Gaylors can get heated so please refrain from doing so, is a creative and musical person. I don’t think framing Joe as Willam Bowery was only to get him awards, I think it’s because her partner of six years who Joe is covering for is who she collaborated with. I also believe this person does or did have ties to London/England, which is why she picked Joe. I don’t necessarily believe it ended when the Joe relationship did, as I think trying to be linked to Matty was significant, but she had to cut it short. 

TLDR: I believe Taylor dated someone from the end of 2016 to at least Midnights drop last year, and maybe it’s still going on today. I think this mystery woman has many of the qualities and talents Taylor has attributed to Joe.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Gaylor_Swift/comments/16orgwt/lets_talk_about_the_partner_of_six_years_comment/,"Let’s talk about the “partner of six years” comment she made, and why some believe Taylor has been in a relationship since late 2016.

"I was at Minneapolis N2.

For example, I couldn’t hear myself singing during the 1989 set! I swear the entire stadium knew every word. The energy was through the roof for Reputation too. I was getting a little tired and dehydrated at the point but thankfully the crowd’s energy re-invigorated me.

It surprised me that Midnights era didn’t get as much love. I was on the floor and felt a little self conscious loudly singing along because the people around me were more subdued. Maybe because it was the final set and people were winding down?

The crowd was naturally quieter during Folklore & Evermore, with the exception of “Champagne Problems” and “Tolerate It”.

Lover being the opener was totally hyped up, then Red and Speak Now’s Enchanted, and slightly less for Fearless (not me though because it’s my favorite era)

"After watching countless videos on when to arrive to have a great day with lines, getting merch and food etc., I got mixed messages and decided to share the timeline that worked for me. Please feel free to share yours for those few last shows.

Background info: I avoided the big merch truck line and went to a night 2 show. Parking lots opened at 1:00 p.m. and so did the smaller merch tents on the outside of the stadium. I live, on a typical day, about 30-45 minutes from the stadium. 

11:30: Left home with food, water, and essentials in the car

12:30ish: Was 2nd in line for the parking lot. Had our pick of spots. Had my concert buddy walk to a smaller merch stand and wait in line there. She was 2nd in line.

1:00: I parked and my friend got merch. They were sold out of a lot from the two nights before (our city had an early merch day with the truck), but we got what we could. If you want something specific, go to the merch truck, because the smaller stands don't have everything. Brought merch back to the car.

1:10- 3:15: Hung out in the parking lot. Ate our packed lunch and snacks, drank water, and went to the bathroom (portapotty).

BIG TIP: The venue changed their rules about bringing in food and water the night before night 1 and it's good that I double-checked, because I was planning on bringing in food before I knew I couldn't.

3:15: Walked to the gate. Brought a small snack and what was left of my water and finished it in line, then threw it away in a trash can outside the gate. There were about 6 different lines at my gate and we had about 15-20 people in front of us in our line. Take this time to think about if you need to go left or right to your section.

This was the worst part as it was really hot that day and there was no shade. If you have a friend, take turns waiting in line and taking a shade break if you can find any.

4:20-4:30: Line moved forward and gates opened. It was quick to get in. Make sure you have your tickets up and ready. Grab your wristband.

4:30-5:00: Went to the bathroom immediately. There were a few people there, but no lines. Find your closest food vendor if you're not picky about what to eat and you don't plan on having alcohol. Buy dinner and a snack for later. Buy the largest drink size they have. Again, we had no line.

5:00- 6:30: Find your seats, eat, drink, take pictures, exchange bracelets, and chill. We did have to go back into the tunnel area of our section for shade, but this depends on your weather and comfort level. It was around this time that the inside merch and bathroom lines were soooooo long.

6:30-7:50ish: Watch the openers and the stadium start filling up. If you really need to go to the bathroom, go now. I didn't need to go because I was sipping my drink slowly and not chugging, even though it was hot. 

7:50ish: Taylor came on EARLY. She typically starts at 8:05, but on occasion, like my show, she started early. Be in your seats by at least 7:35. 

That's it! I didn't need a bathroom break or more food at all during the show so I saw everything. Everyone is different, but hopefully this helps.

"I know that Spotify and Apple Music have her instrumentals (with backing vocals) available from Debut to reputation and I’ve been a big fan of them for a while.

My current favorites are “Dancing With Our Hands Tied” and “Clean”, hands down. The synth in DWOHT and the layering in “Clean” are both so heavenly. 

The production of her songs are really well done and I hope they eventually release the instrumentals to her later albums but I know it’s probably not going to happen since she’s with a different label now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/141skcy/do_you_listen_to_the_instrumentals_of_her_songs/,"Do you listen to the instrumentals of her songs?

"So I have been thinking how the most convincing Gaylor Proof for me is not rumors about possible secret relationships with women, but the queer themes in her lyrics and music videos.

I was thinking about this randomly today and it made me think about Lil Nas X. Lil Nas X already had music released before he came out as gay, and after coming out he noted his music and associated imagery had many queer-coded references that he thought were obvious to anyone who was paying attention. The cover of ""7"" had a city lit up with rainbow lighting, and after he came out he said he expected people to understand it as flagging. His song ""C7osure"" was about him wrestling with the idea of coming out publicly. He wrote it about that, and he expected people to interpret it from the lyrics even though there is nothing explicitly saying he was gay in the song, if you listen/read the lyrics with the point of view that he is talking about being in the closet, it's easy to see, but if not it's easy to miss. His song ""Montero (Call Me by Your Name)"" references the book and movie ""Call Me by Your Name"" about a young gay couple, which was released after he came out and has more explicitly gay lyrics and imagery in the music video. 

Can anyone think of other examples of a closeted artist flagging through lyrics and imagery in their music and later coming out? I'm not talking about anything in their personal life, I'm just talking about their work as an artist. I feel like this is more common than many people realize, especially Swifties who are insistent that because Taylor has never explicitly came out that there's no way she could be queer in some way.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Gaylor_Swift/comments/17b03oq/examples_of_lgbtqia_artists_who_came_out_after/,Examples of LGBTQIA+ artists who came out (after already putting out music) who had queer themes before coming out?,Gaylor_Swift,t3_17b03oq,/r/Gaylor_Swift/comments/17b03oq/examples_of_lgbtqia_artists_who_came_out_after/,2023-10-18 20:11:03,Taylor Swift,0.40614098

"I’ve been a fan (fluctuating from casual to moderate) since Love Story first hit radios and have a general understanding of the fan lore around her, but I never considered myself a stan. Until seeing discussion on this sub, I mostly only heard the world stan in context of toxic, obsessive stan culture. 

However, in this sub I’ve seen people proudly declare themselves stans, so maybe I’m just not up to date with the lingo! 

So, I’m curious: How do you define stan vs fan, and which are you? Does stan have a bad or good connotation? What makes a “good” stan vs a “toxic” stan?

"This isn’t a debate, more so an overview. It’s undeniable Taylor’s music is waaay more popular, but that could also be explained by the fact that her music is so much more listenable to a wider audience than Kanye’s music. Personally, I believe that Kanye has left a more significant impact to the music and fashion industry than Taylor, not to downplay her music. Simply I believe that Kanye’s music has changed the idea of rap and music in general, by including his personal turmoils and hardships in his songs, his most obvious being My Dark Beautiful Twisted fantasy. I also believe he’s changed the record for fashion and design as well. The life of Pablo’s album cover was so ahead of its time as an example, the repeated words and sentences, “Which one?” Symbolising his bipolar personality. Kanye is also, sadly, a very mentally unhinged person. His mood swings and out going personality portray him as an egotistical douche, whilst the lyrics in power and runaway shoe is that he knows this and that there’s no real way to change it. His mother’s death probably was a catalyst to his downfall and increased instability. Now let’s talk about Taylor, it appears she is a very kind and respectable person, who I personally think makes cookie cutter music.  Her music to me is of someone who know what to write and how to deliver very presentable music. Her music always does well, and to me that is because it is very easy to digest and enjoy, the kind of stuff you can listen to and be hyped for at any time, you know? And she has obviously done well since she’s the most streamed woman on Spotify and second most streamed person on Spotify. Where these two mainly clash is with the fans and when Kanye crashed Taylor’s award. To me, both hardcore fans are as insufferable as the other, hardcore fans is the main bit. Kanye fans perceive him as a god and the biggest person in media ever, whilst Taylor fans celebrate her not in an aggresive  way but more so in a loud way, a way where you’d just kind of ask them to kindly f*ck off, and when you diss her music they get ultra mad. To finish off, Kanye fans like to say Kanye’s quote “I made that bitch famous…” which is just not true. What’s funny is that Taylor kind of saved Kanye in a weird way. If it wasn’t for the ceremony crash Kanye would’ve likely never made MDBTF and would’ve never redeemed himself. So Taylor fans of any Kanye fans say that, bring up that MDBTF was in a way made through Taylor’s award.

The only great concerts I’ve ever been to have been at smaller clubs.

Think about this- if she had been able to tour Lover, we wouldn’t have Folklore/Evermore… maybe even Midnights.  And even if we did, it wouldn’t have been released as quickly.  I will take new music over live shows ANY DAY.  I wish instead of touring she was focusing on new music.

"*They’re dimming the street lights, you’re perfect for me / Why aren’t you here tonight?*


This is the second time in the song that Taylor mentions standing outside of his home - earlier, she states that she’ll be there when it’s cold & all the other girls have gone home. I love that she calls back to that line in this bridge. I imagine her standing under a street light, without a coat (she didn’t think Stephen would take this long), pacing for warmth but never going farther than the length of his house. She’s probably been standing there since school got out. Now the sun has been down for hours since it’s winter & the street lights are being dimmed. Where could he be?

1. Do the (One to One) option when you text to each individual member, do they see it the same as you, or it is like a private chat where the NJ member sees all the messages from everyone and she answers to them? 

2. All the messages the girls reply that everyone always can see them, or they have an option to answer to an specific person without anyone else’s seeing it? 

3. (Not a question) I will appreciate answers with at least some kind of evidence or proof that makes there answer have sense, if you are going to answer with speculations I will prefer for you to don’t answer my questions. Even tho, I will appreciate any answer that can help me finish with this debate I have.

(Extra) I know the girls are most of the time busy, or simply not getting on the app, and I know hundreds of persons text to them every day so I’m aware that probably they are not going to answer my messages, Im asking this questions cause I want to know everything as detailed as it can be, so I fully know what am getting on to, and to don’t face a disappointment after thinking things that are not going to happen.

"So I was listening to it after the interview where she explained about toning back her language, and I think I noticed a few more. The one I was most sure of is in ‘get him back!’, when she rhymes dance with “fly me to France” as a response to him saying something dumb.

I always thought this sounded weird, and this most recent listen my thought filled it in as “kick him in the pants”. It’s a perfect rhyme and fits with the frustration she has with the guy, and the actual line feals like it jumps a few steps in the story to make sense.

"First of all, I'm not an expert in music, don't read into a singer or band's history, don't know how to play an instrument, don't hum a song and stuff, I'm just a casual music listener. I didn't listen to her entire discography and heard a few songs of her. Inspired by the thread ""I don't understand the Taylor Swift phenomenon"", I need to write a few reasons why her popularity is soaring: 

1. Looks. Besides her facial look with signature blonde hair and red lipstick, she's tall and fit, and looks like she's a woman to be desired. Nowadays material things and appearance matter.  

2. Rich parents. If she was born into poor parents in a house infested with cockroaches and mice and water dripping down ceilings, she wouldn't make her way to superstardom. I read that her father did everything possible to make his daughter's dreams come true.

3. Target audience. A fair percent of the world population have basic tastes like ""ex BF bad"" and they are lazy people who find it difficult to find things to enjoy by themselves and let popularity make decisions for them. And the lack of appreciation for fine things like music, art, food and fashion leads to her popularity. 

4. Parasocial relationship (article 4 is applicable to every other celebrity, movie etc as well). Some people feel unhappy, broke, poor, unattractive, ostracized and the IRL people around them (parents, friends, teachers etc) and live vicariously through celebs who don't know they exist. And some people find happiness and hope in celebrities' song lyrics, movie quotes, cars they drive, houses they live, clothes, shoes and accessories they wear, love affairs and marriages they experience, vacations they go when they feel bad. 

5. PR work and media. Again it's applicable to every overly popular celebrity. Media works on supply and demand. The actual topics in the world are already depressing, like wars, climate crisis, environmental crises, economy etc, so people want something to cheer up while reading the news. 

That's my take as an outsider.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1795z6u/i_can_understand_the_taylor_swift_phenomenon/,I can understand the Taylor Swift phenomenon,Music,t3_1795z6u,/r/Music/comments/1795z6u/i_can_understand_the_taylor_swift_phenomenon/,2023-10-16 13:28:23,Taylor Swift,0.32074678
"Getaway Car and Say Don't Go feel very similar to me. They strike me as Taylor looking at the same situation from different perspectives. Overall, both songs talk a lot about Taylor leaving first, with Getaway Car saying  ""Should've known I'd be the first to leave"" and Say Don't Go saying ""Halfway out the door, but it won't close"". The first thing that struck me was ""We're a shot in the darkest dark"" (SDG) and ""We never had a shotgun shot in the dark"" (GC). Both lyrics obviously refer to a shot in the dark in terms of a relationship. There's also a parallel between ""I struck a match and blew your mind.""(GC) and ""I strike a match and you blow it out"" (SDG). For some less obvious connections there were ""I'm standin' on a tightrope alone"" (SDG) and ""And the circus ain't a love story.""(GC), Walking on a tightrope is often a circus act. There's also ""Now your silence has me screaming say don't go""(SDG) and ""And I was screamin' go go go'' (GC). This one is admittedly a reach, though the lyrics both do reference screaming. The last thing I saw was ""You were drivin' the getaway car""(GC) and ""I wait for you to drive by""(SDG). These songs strike me as different sides of the same coin. In both songs, Taylor references leaving but in SDG she clearly doesn't want to leave while in GC she takes the initiative to leave. One song is her wanting someone to want her to stay while the other is her lamenting that she never could have.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/183dbvf/getaway_car_and_say_dont_go_song_comparison/,Getaway Car and Say Don't Go song comparison,TaylorSwift,t3_183dbvf,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/183dbvf/getaway_car_and_say_dont_go_song_comparison/,2023-11-25 06:18:51,Taylor Swift,0.28548008
"I’m not interested in your opinions about the relationship itself. But now with 1989 TV and the vault tracks. 

I was a directioner back in the day (I have a one direction tattoo lmao), and I was 16 when haylor dated. I listened to Taylor A LOT but I wasn’t active in her fandom. 

I remember so vividly how horrible the directioners treated her. I’m not blaming them (edit: I’m not blaming them solely for how the media treated Taylor), but I think they contributed to the online discourse surrounding Taylor back in the day. The harries and the larries. The picture I remember most from 2012–2013 is the blue dress in the boat and how everyone made fun of her 😔

Do you think the same would have happened today? Or have the younger stans (of anything) started realizing that that wasn’t ok?

While she does have a few hit songs that I personally find catchy I never would actually listen to her on a daily bases. Imo she doesn’t really have any complex beats in her music and her lyrics aren’t relatable her music always seemed very static or generic.

"Have any of yall thought about what Taylor's last album would be? I know this won't be for a LONG while (probably decades), but how do you think it will be? 

Personally, I think it will be more lyrically rich (especially with such an iconic career) and introspective like folklore, Evermore, & Midnights (maybe) but not in an escapism sense. I think the style will almost be a mix of everything she's done in past albums. Kinda like a compilation swan song if you will.

Then she points out the line from Tim McGraw, “…Chevy Truck with a tendency of getting stuck…” 

Then the line from Tis’ The Damn Season, “…messy as the mud on your truck tires…” and also points out how the song is about reconnecting with an old ex. “The road not taken looks real good now…” (amongst other lines)

"I’ve noticed the majority of midnights hate is by Swifties. The rating on meta critic is 8.3 the same rating as rep and 1989, which is fantastic for a pop album. Some Swiftie say it’s a step back from Folklore and evermore but i don’t see that. The writing might not be as good a folklore and evermore but it’s still fantastically written and in my opinion is her best written pop album. In my opinion it’s one of most fun albums and super easy to listen to. Ever since it came out in October it was immediately one of my favorites. I still think most swifties enjoy it, i just see more hate from swifties then the general public.

"I am and have been a huge Swiftie. However, when they are problematic things going on I'm all for having an open and healthy discussion about it. Lately, I have been finding that there is soft censorship of any bad PR related to Taylor, Swifites or her boyfriend. It's been really alarming to me. When the media does it I still get it, but to see even the Taylor Swift mods subreddit participate (or not participate in it) has been alarming. I'll highlight three cases from the recent past here.

1. Travis Kelce's Old '""Problematic"" Tweets: When the tweets first began to emerge they were the funny and goofy ones. Soon after there were some pretty nasty 2010 Tweets where Travis was fat shaming ""ugly"" women, and calling people ""retards"". It was quite unsettling. I know that Travis went through some hard stuff including being kicked off the team in 2011 and had a turn around, so it's possible he's not the same person as he was anymore. But, what I was surprised to learn was that almost no media outlet brought up the ugly tweets. The main TaylorSwift subreddit refused to discuss it. Apparently some Swifties tried posting it but the mods wouldn't approve it. Today I tuned into the New Heights podcast and I was shocked to see that Travis didn't address it either. I was expecting at least an acknowledgement. The blatant ignoring of what happened feels very problematic.
2. Addressing xenophobia: In the aftermath of the fan passing away in Brazil, some West Swifites both on Reddit and TikTok were being very Xenophobic, asking Taylor to return home asap, and that it wasn't safe for her, or worse infanalizing her. It was honestly were appalling to see such toxic fandom and how bigoted people could be. I also have found no major outlet covering the xenophobia or hate Brazil was getting.
3. I have tried to bring up these a couple of times on r/TaylorSwift but the fandom tends to either downvote people talking about it, saying that it's not problematic and the popular media isn't even discussing it.

I was wondering if anyone else had similar experiences or know of any other Taylor related media censorship. I generally have a positive view of Taylor and many Swifites. I also think that part of sustaining a healthy image is to deal with critics, own up to it or engage with it. To see even anonymous platforms like Reddit censoring it is very unsettling. It makes me wonder what else I don't know because I didn't pick it up on my own.

&#x200B;

Edit 1: For some people asking why I think Taylor should answer to those tweets: I am not saying she has to answer for the tweets; I'm asking why nobody wants to allow *any* discussion about the tweets.

Edit 2: Re: A few tweets

He replied to someone with intellectual disability as ""they slow as hell cuz there parents have been talkin to them like they were re\*\*rded since they were babies"" The Kelce family runs an autism foundation, so I'd be pretty unsettled by anyone championing a cause and not acknowleding that ""yeah, I said some problematic things; I have grown now"". 

Another one “damn the clippers girls gotta be the shitty girls that dont make the lakers girls team, cuz they all was ugly,” he tweeted in 2010, following up a month later with, ""i gotta get outta here, its too weak!!! im getting attacked by ugly girls",https://www.reddit.com/r/popculturechat/comments/181jzuf/the_curious_case_of_censorship_of_taylor_swift/,The curious case of censorship of Taylor Swift negative PR (both on Reddit and news outlet)?,popculturechat,t3_181jzuf,/r/popculturechat/comments/181jzuf/the_curious_case_of_censorship_of_taylor_swift/,2023-11-22 21:17:56,Taylor Swift,0.16043124
"Since Taylor played Coney Island the day The National released their album, it made me think about how future surprise songs could potentially be chosen based on their relevance to the tour date.

For example, her 3 NJ shows are happening over Memorial Day Weekend, so I’m curious if she’ll play Epiphany one of those nights. 

I’d love to hear other thoughts and possible predictions along these lines.

P.S. It could just be wishful thinking on my part because I’m going to her 5/27 show and I would *love* to hear her play Epiphany live on the piano.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/132ymxj/surprise_song_connections/,Surprise Song Connections,TaylorSwift,t3_132ymxj,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/132ymxj/surprise_song_connections/,2023-04-29 15:30:02,Taylor Swift,0.028974265

"So I've been hearing snippets and even the full version of the bonus *Guts* song ""Obsessed"" by Olivia and let me tell you, it is *so good!* This feels somewhat different than her original tracks, but it retains her signature use of angst-like lyrics and melody. The story she paints is so vivid, which is why this is such as standout track. I especially like the tempo and lyricism in the end where she says ""is she friends with your friends?// Is she good in bed?"" and continues the same tempo with ""Is she easy-going?//Never controlling?"" If you know, you know.

"Mods please let this post stay up even though it has nothing to do with Gaylor

Did anybody else know that Joe asked Gigi Hadid out to a baseball game when she was 13 and he was 19? 

Gigi's quote about it just makes it worse too because it illustrates how young she was 

The two celebs first met while attending the Grammy Awards. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Gigi said, ""We met at the Grammys when I was 13 years old. And he asked me to a baseball game, and I said no."" She continued, ""I was so nervous; I literally didn’t even know what it meant to hang out with a boy. And also, Grammys are on a Sunday, and I didn’t want to tell him that I had school the next day, so I was like, 'No, maybe next time.'

Edit: here's amoruee quote that just makes thier whole relationship feel fucked up. Like he was playing the long game and just waiting until she was age appropriate. 


“I didn’t have my phone with me, and I don’t think he did either because we were at the Grammys, and so he wrote his number on a piece of paper and gave it to my mom,” she went on. “And then we’ve been friends ever since.

"I always thought that earlier Taylor Swift song's especially hit hard. I don't think she was a better singer than she is now (up until 1989). But I do think she is very good at covneying emotions through her voice, even now but I think it's lacking in rerecordings.

I try to enjoy them for the more mature voice but especially on Red TV, I miss the emotions. People love the ATW 10 Min version. I really like to go back once in a while to the original. But personally I think some songs miss that emotional touch that makes them S tier for me. 

For example, Sad Beautiful Tragic and Come Back ... Be Here have been all time favourites of mine, especially during the bridge. In the last year they fell of my personal ranking and I wondered if it was because I over listened to them but no. I think it's enitrely due to the rerecording of Red. 

When I compare them side by side, I just reall miss the special touch those songs have in the original.   
I think she did a good job in the 5 min version of ATW but not so much on the other emotional songs of the album.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/15cfwly/what_song_do_you_think_is_lacking_emotionally_in/,What song do you think is lacking emotionally in the rerecording's?,TaylorSwift,t3_15cfwly,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/15cfwly/what_song_do_you_think_is_lacking_emotionally_in/,2023-07-29 01:58:37,Taylor Swift,0.057005897
"Hi everyone! First post here :o) longtime fan, but new to collecting!

I’m about to purchase a signed Blood Moon and I’m trying to make sure that the signature that I’m purchasing is authentic. The seller seems genuine and I trust them. I’m noticing that the signature is on the wood paneling on the right side, where most signed Blood Moon vinyls are signed on the curtains on the left. I attached a photo with only the signature— I don’t want the seller to think that I don’t trust them if they see this post!

Did Taylor alternate sides/are both sides are legit? (“both of these things can be truuue”)

"We've reached the final round of our best lyrics game! It's been a fun ride - I'll do a post with the consolidated final results tomorrow, including some album-by-album breakdowns.

But first, the winning verse from Round 11 (best 3-word lyric) is:

Wanting was enough (with 17% of the vote)

The runners up were:

* 2nd place: Pathological people pleaser (15% of the votes)
* 3rd place: Mosaic broken hearts (15% of the votes)
* 4th place: Drop everything now (11% of the votes)

Which means the results so far are:

1. (13): You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
2. (12): Please don't ever become a stranger whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
3. (11): Now I'm begging for footnotes in the story of your life
4. (10): You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
5. (9): So casually cruel in the name of being honest
6. (8): Darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream
7. (7) Leaving like a father, running like water
8. (6) You drew stars around my scars
9. (5) Forever is the sweetest con
10. (4) Memories feel like weapons
11. (3) Wanting was enough

[Vote for the round 12 (best 2-word lyric) winner here!](https://linkto.run/p/BBXXJ755)

For Round 13, please comment below with a single word you think is top tier. For example: ""ME-HEE-HEE""\*

For Round 13 and Round 13 only, there will not be an interim poll for voting! The most upvoted comment (based on total number of upvotes) will be declared the winner. 

Finally, two brief clarifying points:

* In case anyone was wondering, let's make a blanket rule that hyphenated words count as one word, not two
* A subset of a winning verse from a prior round will be ineligible in later rounds (i.e., ""daydream"" will be ineligible for best word)

All that said: **what's your favorite word from any Taylor Swift song??**

I wanted to go to that performance so bad! I even entered radio contests back when she announced it, but no luck!

There is a rawness to her voice when sung live that I am obsessed with, especially Cornelia street and her guitar!! She should have made an acoustic version of that song, I die every time I listen to the live version.
I also love daylight on the piano, it’s so perfect.

I hope she releases more live songs, the hit different and I love how her voice sounds and she gives everything and every emotion, which is felt more through live performances",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/18bwuuf/lets_talk_about_lover_live_at_paris/,Let’s talk about Lover live at Paris!,TaylorSwift,t3_18bwuuf,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/18bwuuf/lets_talk_about_lover_live_at_paris/,2023-12-06 05:26:27,Taylor Swift,0.18269104

"This is going to be a hopefully brief comparison between some of the lyrics from Hoax with some of the songs that we know Taylor wrote about Joe.

HOAX: Your sleight of hand

CORNELIA STREET: Back when we were card sharks, playing games
I thought you were leading me on//but then you called, showed your hand, I turned around

HOAX: My barren land
I am ash from your fire

YOU'RE LOSING ME: I'm getting tired even for a phoenix
Always risin' from the ashes

HOAX: Stood on the cliffside
Screaming ""Give me a reason""

YOU'RE LOSING ME: And I'm fading, thinkin'
""Do something, babe, say something"" 

HOAX: Don't want no other shade of blue
But you

DELICATE: Oh, damn, never seen that color blue 

HOAX: You knew the password, so I let you in the door

GLITCH: I think there's been a glitch
A brief interruption, a slight malfunction

HOAX: You know I left a part of me back in New York

FALSE GOD: I'm New York City, I still do it for you, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you're led by blind faith

CORNELIA STREET: I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kind of heartbreak time could never mend

HOAX: You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
But what you did was just as dark

KING OF MY HEART: Is this the end of all the endings?
My broken bones are mending

HOAX: My twisted knife//
My win-less fight
This has frozen my ground

GREAT WAR: Your finger on my hairpin triggers
Soldier down on that icy ground//It was war, it wasn't fair

AFTERGLOW: Fighting with a true love is boxing with no gloves

CALL IT WHAT YOU WANT: My castle crumbled overnight, I brought a knife to a gunfight


HOAX: My best laid plan
Your sleight of hand
My barren land
I am ash from your fire

WILLOW: Wreck my plans, that's my man

HOAX: My only one
My kingdom come undone
My broken drum
You have beaten my heart

KING OF MY HEART: You are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart

 
Some of these I am more sure of, they just seem TOO close to be coincidence? Others are more of a reach but could still be an intentional inclusion by Taylor. I'm not saying that they were broken up a long time ago, but that likely they DID break up before... Perhaps several times? This seems confirmed by sources that said that had ""rough patches before, but always worked out out"".

" 

I think most of us have noticed how the aesthetics for the TVs have been.. updated so far. Taylor covers so many themes in each album, so for the TVs she's just picked other aspects from the ones highlighted during their original eras. So basically,

Red tv is now a fall album, which makes sense, especially since it was lead by ATW, the quintessential fall song. The original had this indie hipster vibe to it, and the more pop-y singles fit well into that, but the country songs definitely give off more autumn vibes to me.

1989 tv is a beach album instead of the citycore/ New York album it was. There are songs with references to nature and water, and multiple mvs feature beaches. Slut! feels like it takes place on one of those fancy rich people cruise ships, and Is It Over Now? actually features her on that boat in her blue dress.

Fearless tv is more fairytale-y and hones in more on Love Story's shiny golden aesthetic rather than the relatable teenage pain of YBWM. Technically there's only 2 photos(and a self made mv) to go off of for this, but those two definitely emphasize the fantasy escapist aspect more than the og cover with it's teenage-freedom -headbanging vibes.

Speak Now tv is a lot more mature. The black background instead of the white, Taylor's more serious expression, plus I Can See You being much more sensual capitalizes more on the more adult, grown themes of the album than the original aesthetic does.

I feel like rep is easy to conceptualize because it has a nice clean cut between the two themes it explores. The og hammers in the badass, more edgy media's pov of her, so I feel like tv will go for the more lovestruck, gentle theme like delicate. I'd like to see her do something like [this](https://in.pinterest.com/pin/3940718415183462/), [the](https://in.pinterest.com/pin/563018695620266/) [spilling wine in the bathtub](https://in.pinterest.com/pin/7248049394236242/), day [after](https://in.pinterest.com/pin/59180182595072818/) [the](https://in.pinterest.com/pin/792703971908926047/) party, kind of thing. Like [the](https://in.pinterest.com/pin/134826582586998230/) opulence of wearing fancy diamonds and rings but the relatability of being content in love. The corners are [little](https://in.pinterest.com/pin/64105994687683763/) blurred, like how everything feels a little softer around the edges when you're in love.

I'm most curious about debut, cause it has a little bit of everything, and no real clear singular aesthetic to me beyond the obvious kitschy country teen thing in the og. (I also have listened to the debut in a while so my memory of it may be rusty)

"I’ve been seeing a lot of swifties online constantly saying stuff like “Oh Taylors not beating the Red favoritism allegations” “1989’s her favorite we’ve been known” “oh she hates Speak Now—“ “Fearless got the evermore treatment” “blah blah blah” but what
I’ve noticed is that she doesn’t give a consistent treatment to each of the re-records, possibly for a good reason, and that none of them seem to have a significant leg above the others. No re-record has the favoritism treatment, they all just were treated vastly different from each other and based on when they were released had an influence on how it was put out:

Best vinyl looks: **Speak Now**

Most vinyl variations: **1989**

Best album cover: **Speak Now/1989**

The longest era: **Red** *(nearly a year, even after midnights was released she was still promoting the Red red vinyl on her store)*

Most MVs: **Red** (2)

Least MVs: **1989** (0)

Has ATW10: **Red**

Most Faithful to the og sound: **Speak Now**

The one she chose to put out first: **Fearless**

The one that wasn’t given a proper announcement: **Red** *(just a post on social media)*

The one that wasn’t given any special vinyl variant: **Red** *(only had black and red, but the other albums before—Folklore, Evermore, Fearless—had a red variant and more soooooo)*

Most blatant hints to being announced: **Speak Now** *(all of bejeweled mv, when she came on stage with curly hair)*

Album with most vault songs: **Red** *(especially with Taylor releasing ALL songs created for the Red album)*

Album with least vault songs: **1989** *(no, I don’t consider Sweeter Than Fiction nor Bad Blood Remix a vault because it was already released by Taylor.)*

The re-record she says is her favorite: **1989**
*(I put in this one to mention that she didn’t say this was her favorite album, but her favorite re-record, most likely meaning she had the best time re-recording it.)*

Fearless was the test re-record. Red was the successful follow up that had to put in more effort to put more eyes on the re-recording process. Speak Now got the hype from the eras tour and post Midnights release, and 1989 benefited from the same midnights and eras tour hype on top of already being the Pop Bible and most globally successful album with Midnights production for the vault tracks.

I assume Rep will essentially get around the same treatment as 1989, and Debut will get the same as Speak Now, if not a tad bit more to compensate being the only album Taylor has released to not go #1 on Billboard.

"Obviously this is a few years away, but we all know Taylor won't let the milestone pass without celebration. Particularly because it will be so well-timed as a career retrospective, likely coming just after the completion of the TVs. Taylor and her team will want to seize the opportunity to cement her legacy... So how could they do it?

1. **Double album.** She's never done one before, and this would be the natural slot for it. Two parts, thirteen songs each. I think this is the strongest possibility, and honestly, would be surprised if we didn't get it.
2. **Returning writing/producing partners.** At least one song with each of Liz Rose and Max Martin, her main mentors from her formative years. A great way to honor their contribution to her growth as a songwriter, while also emphasizing how far she's come. (Jack and Aaron go without saying, of course.)
3. **Long-awaited collaborations.** Selena, Harry, or just a fellow superstar like Drake or Beyonce. Something that will really register as an Event, both for fans and to get the media talking about the album.
4. **Super Bowl.** Maybe she'll decide to do it before then, but after all the reports of her turning 2023's show down, it seems clear she's saving it for a more opportune moment. What could be better than a tight 13-song set, spanning her whole astounding career?
5. **Era-by-era callbacks.** This might be too creatively restrictive, but we know Taylor is sentimental and understands the power of each era's aesthetic. She could deliberately incorporate all thirteen in some way, tying each track of an album into a past album, or building an epic song around the progression (thirteen minutes would top ATWTMVTVFTV!).
6. **Retirement/hiatus.** Don't kill me, but Taylor may not keep doing this forever, at least not at her current pace. If she's going to take a break at some point, the tour following her thirteenth album would be an ideal victory lap. But even if it's announced as a farewell, I imagine she'll be back.

"Although the first stage of Miley Cyrus’ career was carefully mapped out for her by Disney executives, she’s been hell-bent on being whoever she wants to be since separating from the Hannah Montana brand. The singer has affected a new striking skin with each album cycle, a process that’s helped keep her at the top of the pop world even when her music has lacked quality. 2013’s *Bangerz* was filled with gaudy neon lights and unmelodious hooks, *Younger Now* was a mild foray into country, and *Plastic Hearts* was Cyrus’ uneven love letter to the rock music that [shaped her](https://loudwire.com/miley-cyrus-freedom-rock-music-all-genres-spotify-rock-this/). 

On her eighth studio album, *Endless Summer Vacation*, the thirty-year-old covers vintage dance-pop. She dials down the controversial antics to make the music the centre of attention, but it’s all so square and predictable. Pedestrian synth-laden beats hold back Cyrus’ quest to rediscover love and redefine herself. It’s pop music without the pop. Never has there been less of an incentive to tune into whatever Cyrus is doing.  

The singer has made worse-sounding albums, but *Endless Summer Vacation* is Cyrus' first release that is bland. It is cookie-cutter pop without pizzaz. You can even track down the geneses of so many of the album’s facets: The chintzy tropical accents on *Island* mimic a sound that’s recently brought Harry Styles stupefying levels of success, *River* is a clunky facsimile of Lady Gaga’s signature mechanical frenzy. Cyrus doesn’t even bother hiding that her overwrought chanting on *Muddy Feet* is inspired by pop’s most inordinate voice Sia, and just tacks her onto the back end of the song. 

Around a dozen names are given production credits, the list reads like a who’s who of pop purists yet no one injects their personality into the soundscape. The beats are consistently summery and run together smoothly; the pleasant plodding bassline of *Rose Coloured Lenses* leads into *Thousand Miles*, a country-pop ballad, without complication, but that plateau is precisely the problem. The unit creates an undisruptive, placid experience but the album would benefit greatly from having its layers defined more clearly to break up some of the gooeyness. When Maxx Morando finally takes the initiative to venture outside of the box on *Handstand*, its distortion is immediately ear-catching. 

Ahead of the album’s release, Cyrus said that she had separated it into two parts, “The ‘AM’... where there’s a buzz and an energy and a potential of new possibilities,” as well as a ‘PM’ that embodied “slinky, seediness and kind of a grime but a glamour at the same time.” It’s an engaging theme that is limited by the lack of contrast in the production. The record’s second half does, in fact, house the more mellow moments (*Wonder Woman* and *Flowers (Demo)*). If you’re feeling extremely generous, you might describe them as slinky and glamourous, if you aren’t the words lethargic and dull will come to mind.  

Cyrus’ wonderful raspy tone, her greatest asset, is severely underutilised here. It’s only during a rip-roaring chorus on *Jaded* and a prickly, jubilant performance on *You* that Cyrus deploys it freely, flexing her vocal prowess. Elsewhere, she opts to colour inside the lines instead, further neutering notes of energy across the album. Cyrus spends the opening minute and a half of *Handstand* whispering with an unsettling metallic twang. As her voice briefly fades away, giving space for the acrobatic synths to blare, it feels like she might erupt on re-entry but she just goes back to the hushed delivery. She builds up so much tension yet there’s no real pay-off. 

There are many parallels between the lyrical content of *Endless Summer Vacation* and *Plastic Hearts*. On both, Cyrus seems to be reframing her thoughts on romance, scrubbing away her wide-eyed naivety and replacing it with mature insight. There are lines like “I'm sorry that you're jaded/I could've taken you places/You're lonely now and I hate it,” from *Jaded* and “Don't wait for me/'Cause forever may never come,” from *Wildcard* that are expertly sculpted after Cyrus’ experience with a rocky marriage and divorce from Liam Hemsworth. It’s a sign that even though a fixed musical identity still evades her, Cyrus is growing more comfortable with herself. 

As is, *Endless Summer Vacation* is the lackadaisical affair its title suggests it might be. There's a silver lining to all the stability, though: Cyrus' most turbulent, exhausting instincts are muted. There’s evidence that Cyrus is evolving, albeit slowly, and not just shapeshifting.

My two cents: 
- Even if we disregard the Karlie part, the two songs clearly have similarities 
- That’s interesting because either she sampled it on purpose OR did it accidentally because a) she had previously listened to Waiting Game Or b) watched the VS video a bunch

"I don’t really understand the Taylor Swift hype. Her music just doesn’t have the impact as the legends that she’s allegedly compared to. People look at the numbers she does in terms of album sells and how much money she makes when she goes on tour, but it still doesn’t translate in regards to her music having the impact on pop culture in regards to how other legends impact pop culture. Like look at Beyoncé, that’s who I would say is a real icon. There’s an entire generation of artist/people who want to be Beyoncé and looked up to her. You can see Beyoncé in many artist today. I don’t see that when it comes to Taylor Swift. I just see her benefitting from her demographic of fans, not necessarily her music transcending like some of these other talents.

"I've come across several posts that are centred on live vocals, lip synching and dancing (don't want to get into it). Recently started watching newjeans live performances, and I wasn't aware about prerecordings and backtracks etc. My discussion/post would like to focus on the members live vocals especially when they have to do their choreo. 

I might be grasping at straws, but do they have mic(s) on for some members and for others not? I don't have a bias here, but I can't help but notice I typically can hear the short girl (Hanni, I think) sing live a lot, sometimes Minji, and sometimes Danielle. But most times, they choose not to sing over the track. I could be imagining it, but is this standard operating procedure in kpop? Like some sing live, others dont, others dampen their voices in the track. Plus hanni (googled her name, sorry new at this), has lines over choreo with lots of (jumping) movement, while the rest don't necessarily have this. 

Think of for instance hypeboy, the high ah ah part for hanni vs danielle (hanni has got to move, while danielle stays in place). In cookie as well, she seems to have lines in the intense part of the choreo.

The tall one, Hyein, skip-hop-jumping parts in live performances, you can barely here any inconsistency in her singing, which seems not quite accurate (which implies to me, she could have an off mic, or just not vocalizing enough).

And sometimes they all just sound like the studio version. 


So my question is what's up with live performances? Oh and in some, they sound good but kind of altered (like in the its live performance) 


Lastly, I'd like to see how Haerin (the one who is likened to a cat alot), and Minji sound like in tracks where they are like the main singers or something. So any ador staff lurking here, let's see. 

As I type this, I'm learning that hyein is the youngest (thought it was minji). After reading that she's been in the industry for quite a while, I think her voice and charisma shows this. She seems to be aware on how to present as cute, and professional when the camera is on her (when she has her singing lines). But when the camera is not on her, I notice a lot of hiccups in her dancing (which is understandable). Is it typical to have younger teens in kpop? I would source this info out on other subs, but I came across an unpalatable nsfw sub with kpop artists and chose the safety of this sub.

This is in no way, a critique. I'm just curious about the norms and specifically regarding this group.",https://www.reddit.com/r/NewJeans/comments/105um0d/nj_live_vocals_and_kpop_sops/,NJ live vocals and kpop SOPs,NewJeans,t3_105um0d,/r/NewJeans/comments/105um0d/nj_live_vocals_and_kpop_sops/,2023-01-07 17:35:06,New Jeans,0.11450345

"Every so often I see a post talking about Swifties acting weird, entitled, being gatekeepy. And almost every time the user says, ""I usually see this on Twitter and Tiktok.""

A bit of advice: Don't engage with Swifties on Tiktok and Twitter. I'm not saying there aren't good people on there, there are. But in my experience, it is not worth it to sift through all the bullshit behavior just to find a few fun users. Twitter and TikTok Swifties are not accurate representations of the fandom.

**Let me say it louder: Twitter and TikTok Swifties are NOT accurate representations of the fandom.**

With how often we consume social media on a regular basis, it can feel like what we see online is what is happening in the world around us. But really, social media often distorts reality. Even this subreddit isn't entirely an accurate view of all Taylor Swift fans, and I would say it's one of the better platforms to actually discuss Taylor and her artistry, as well as engage with people who are somewhat normal and more well-adjusted.

Twitter and TikTok contribute to horrible behavior and horrible habits. Even over the weekend when fans were (rightfully) upset about all the people showing up at the rehearsal dinner restaurant on LBI, there were users saying things like ""Taylor would HATE you for showing up!"" 

Even ""fans"" who are trying to ""defend"" Taylor for something that is a bit frustrating, are using hateful language and being incredibly aggressive and rude. 

The average Swiftie isn't like this. I'm about to leave my current job of three years and in the past 6 months I have discovered 3 (undercover Swifties as I like to call them) coworkers who are Taylor fans who are just living their lives enjoying her music. One of them is a mom in her early thirties, another is single and loves to garden and reputation is her favorite album, another works from home, and happens to be from my home state, and she loves Red. And they all just love Taylor's music and they aren't concerned with the crazy fans on Twitter and Tiktok.

Even more recent, I found out that the baristas at the cafe at my work are also major Swifties. All three of them. And they just pre-ordered the Sunrise Boulevard vinyl for 1989 TV. We've now been talking about Taylor for the past month, and I had no idea they were such major fans.

These are the normal Swifties. These experiences **are** accurate representations of the fandom. Please don't get yourself down by consuming so much TikTok and Twitter that you forget that we are just normal people who love Taylor's music. There are just some crazies who have too much time on their hands. Unplug from that noise. The fandom is amazing.

"Lavender Haze was either going to be released the day of album release or earlier. I think the multiple clues to the other songs on the album (Mastermind vinyl, Midnight Rain weather report, Karma (karma's the guy on the screen coming straight home to me), etc.) were meant to be easter eggs for us. 

It's been confirmed Taylor was unsure what the lead single was going to be so I think Anti Hero was a last minute decision. It makes sense that Lavender Haze was first, followed by Anti Hero, and then Bejeweled. I think she released Bejeweled earlier than intended due to the Speak Now clues. Ideally, Bejeweled would've led into a Speak Now TV release.

I think it's fun to see how she pivots depending on what's going on. She waited for Anti Hero to drop from #1 on Billboard to release Lavender Haze. I don't think she expected Anti Hero to be #1 that long.

But yeah, tl;dr, Lavender Haze was originally the lead single. I think the references to other songs in the video were meant to clue us into the rest of the tracklist.

"i originally posted this on r/Gaylor_Swift & realized i meant to post it in this community! i’m sure there’s lots of overlap, but i’m missing some of the insight i’ve seen from OG gaylors on this subreddit! 

basically i think taylor is aiming to announce Rep TV using a coveted superbowl ad slot (or at least using Superbowl airtime, which is insanely high traffic, as it’s the most watched live network tv event). the 112 day theory puts the album’s release as Feb.16, which is the friday following superbowl sunday. i think she wants to reintroduce rep to the GP in a massive, iconic way because it did not get the flowers she & jack obviously believe it deserved. Kansas City Chiefs is conveniently the team with the highest odds to win the superbowl, too. 

also notee: a user commented on the og post that 112 is 211 backward. 2/11 = Superbowl Sunday. 

how do you guys she would navigate this if trueee??",https://reddit.com/r/Gaylor_Swift/s/X5KAhHBWCW,REP TV release theory,Gaylor_Swift,t3_171tok1,/r/Gaylor_Swift/comments/171tok1/rep_tv_release_theory/,2023-10-07 01:24:29,Taylor Swift,0.25462922

"I think about Seven a lot, it's the song I've probably written the most analysis for; like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/GaylorSwift/comments/z2k1ls/seven_and_taylors_unreleased_songs/) &amp; [this](https://www.tumblr.com/alex-chaser/711656979452559360/ive-been-thinking-about-seven-and-how-taylor?source=share). But I've had the opening to the spoken version of Seven stuck in my head for days. 

“Romanticising the woman I became” is such an elegant way to put what the Swiftie fandom does, and not unfairly because Taylor and her team have always framed her successes and Toe as the perfect love story but it [literally means](https://www.google.com/search?q=romanticise+definition&amp;rlz=1C1AVFC_enAU1026AU1035&amp;oq=romanticise+definition&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0i15i22i30l2j0i10i22i30j0i15i22i30j0i390i650l2.5507j1j15&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8) to ""idealise in an unrealistic fashion, to make something seem better or more appealing than it is."" 

Wildest Dreams is a song about being anxiously resigned to a sad goodbye, wrapped up in a heart wrenching plea to think well of her. The way she uses it here reminds me of The Archer. 

*“Who could ever leave me darling? But who could stay? You could stay?”* 

Then she strips the opening to Seven. No music. No singing. Nothing to distract from the lyrics.  

So:

*“If you wish to romanticize the woman I became. Then say you’ll remember me, standing in a nice dress, starring at the sunset… Or you could begin... at the beginning. And in that case. Please picture me in the trees.”*

Essentially becomes: 

*If you only want the romanticised version of me. Then please remember me fondly. Or you could stay? And in that case. Please see me for who I’ve always been.*

The spoken/poem version of the song cuts off before ""I used to scream ferociously anytime I wanted"" but that's exactly what Giant Taylor does during the visuals on screen for Anti-Hero. It's soundless, ('I screamed so loud but no one heard a thing' style) but it's interesting how much suggests something's going to change soon.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GaylorSwift/comments/123o6bn/the_eras_tour_spoken_version_of_seven/,The Eras Tour spoken version of Seven,GaylorSwift,t3_123o6bn,/r/GaylorSwift/comments/123o6bn/the_eras_tour_spoken_version_of_seven/,2023-03-27 14:17:06,Taylor Swift,0.1373533
"Lucked out and scored pre-sale today, and scored four tickets to Adele on March 9. Was 1284th in line, wasn't very optimistic about getting any non-dynamic priced tickets so I filtered to hide platinum and to include fees and started clicking around in a panic. Everything was disappearing in the central 100s and I was sh\*tting myself worried that the prices would be dynamically inflated at any second so I bought:

**Artist Registration Sale** Sec 102, Row L, Seat XXX-XXX USD $779.82 x 4

**Fees** USD $5.50 (Order Processing Fee) USD $120.00 (Service Fee) x 4

**Tax** USD $70.18 x 4

**Ticket Delivery** eTickets Free

**USD $3885.50**

I know I should be grateful that these weren't dynamic priced, but almost 1k per ticket on the far side is insane, right? I got 206 row M in the central aisle last December for $420 per ticket all in, during the last presale. I love our gal, but I'd never spent that much - and now *this* much - on a concert in my life.

Reputation: This Is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things (“‘Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do / Hahaha, I can’t even say it with a straight face!”)

Lover: ME! (“Hey kids! / Spelling is fun!”)

Folklore: the last great american dynasty (“She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green”)

Evermore: willow (“But I come back stronger than a 90’s trend”)

Midnights: Karma (“Karma is a cat / Purring in my lap ‘cause it loves me”)",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/13esh1m/campiest_songlyrics_from_each_of_taylors_albums/,Campiest song/lyrics from each of Taylor’s albums?,TaylorSwift,t3_13esh1m,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/13esh1m/campiest_songlyrics_from_each_of_taylors_albums/,2023-05-11 16:36:42,Taylor Swift,0.37576625

"I've been listening to Speak Now before the TV release and it's such a great but also unapologetic album, which in my opinion is a big part of why it's so appealing to people. 
One of the songs that stands out to me is Better Than Revenge. I absolutely love the song. It's giving young and pissed of energy. I honestly wouldn't want to anger Taylor in her Speak Now era, lol. But she's been getting some heat for the lyrics. I know Camilla (who the song is rumored to be about) hasn't been the happiest about it and even seemingly shaded Taylor a bit for it during the Kimyegate. There has been also a bit of a negative feedback for its 'slutshaming' lyrics. So I was wondering do u think she will change the song for the TV release? 
Tbh I personally would hope not. I love the song as it is, with its lyrics which to me are representative of how young and full of emotions she was when she wrote it. Also it's hella catchy.

"\*\*\***The two separate weekly threads that were going on in this subreddit have been merged for now. Feel free to comment any separate or combined ISOs, items for sale, and items for trade on this weekly post.\*\*\***

&amp;#x200B;

**ISO:**

All ISO related posts should be commented in this megathread from now on. *Individual ISO posts will be removed.*

&amp;#x200B;

**SELLING &amp; TRADING:**

Please review the [selling](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwiftMerch/wiki/selling) &amp; [trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwiftMerch/wiki/trading) rules before commenting. As a reminder, your Reddit account should be at least one month old if you want to sell or trade.

The *basic* rules are (but PLEASE review the full rules):

* **You MUST upload a photo of the items you are trading or selling** \- No stock images or images that are not yours. You can upload images to Imgur and share the link in a comment on this post. **THIS ALSO APPLIES TO TRADE OFFERS. Comment with a photo of your item you are offering to trade before private messaging.**
   * Any very RARE items should have a photo with a handwritten timestamp (your Reddit username and the date handwritten on a piece of paper).
   * i.e. ""Record Store Days"" Vinyl Records, 'Lover' Snow Globe, Signed Items, and Lithographs
* If you are interested in a sale or trade, comment ""Sent a private message to you. I accept your listed price or I have X item to trade"" so the moderator(s) know who is reaching out to who.
* No ""Taking offers"" comments - **Items being sold must have a clear price**. If anyone tries to sell something to you ABOVE their listed price - please let the moderators know.
   * If you want to negotiate a lower price or offer something else that is not an ISO, please do so in the comments first.
   * Insane price gouging is not allowed.
   * If you are unsure about the value of an item, feel free to make a post with the ""Fair Trade/Value Question"" flair.
* ***Please edit your comment once you've accepted an offer and tag the user you are selling or trading to.***
* **No trade or sale sniping** \- If an offer is accepted, other members should wait 24 hours before commenting to ask if the transaction went through. If two users make the same offer, the person who offered first gets priority.

There are a lot of scammers out there or bad sellers so these rules are in place to help protect the members of this subreddit.

"As a recovering addict, I’ve always found Taylor’s music to be very healing. While using the term “clean” is somewhat controversial— it can imply that someone was once “dirty”— the song “Clean” is one of my favorites.

"Today in the early morning hours I had gender affirming top surgey! 🥳 And while I was waiting to be rolled into the operating room, I overheard a crowd of like five different nurses on the ward gushing about their tickets for Taylor Swift's upcoming show here in Chicago and I chatted them up. I was already on an IV of pre-op anti-anxiety meds so that made me extra bold.

It was such a lovely, random little moment that helped me feel at ease before a procedure that I've wanted for years but been afraid to undergo. Thanks for making the world a little friendlier today, Swiftie nurses. This kid was not on his own today.

"It is unfortunate that Nathan Chapman and Max Martin have not participated in the re-recording project launched by Taylor Swift. Chapman had contract issues, as he still had ongoing contracts with some Big Machine-signed artists. He was not willing to end them early to join Taylor Swift's re-recording project. Taylor Swift may have balked at the price Max Martin was asking for (or maybe issues about songwriting credits, depending on who you ask). 

Where, do you think their losses are or will be most felt? I feel like Chapman's loss will be most felt in Taylor Swift (Taylor's Version), where that country twang and production will be more difficult to replicate without him. I think Jack Antonoff and Aaron Dessner have performed well to compensate, but the loss will still be felt.

It's harder to say for me about Max Martin. I'm thinking ""I Knew You Were Trouble"" has weaker production for its Taylor's Version, but how much of this is due to losing Max Martin is up in the air.

"I ran into a friend at the beach yesterday, and we were in the water talking. We got bored so we played a game, where someone names a category and you blurt out the first thing that comes to mind. She said song, and I immediately was like “ALL TOO WELL TEN MINUTE VERSION” and she was like “what’s that??” I was low key shocked she’d never heard of atwtmv, so I just said, “oh it’s an amazing song by Taylor swift.” 
her immediate reaction was “ew Taylor swift I hate her!!”

I was shocked because it’s Taylor swift- someone who I believe is a genuinely good person and has phenomenal music. 
so of course I said, “wait what why???!” and my friend just said, “I hate her voice, it’s so annoying” and she started singing you belong with me offkey. and I sang along with her, because yk, I love any chance to sing Taylor songs.

 then I asked what other songs she knew, and she was like “oh I don’t listen to her I just know that one, she gets on my nerves. does she sing about anything other than boyfriends?” so then I tried singing karma to her, lol, and then explained how each song is like a poem or story
my friend has VERY overprotective parents

 so I’m not reallyyyy surprised that she doesn’t know much abt Taylor, I just hate it when people judge others from the very surface. what should I say next time I’m in this experience? I know not everybody is going to like her and her music, and that’s totally ok, I just feel like I could’ve reacted better?

"What won you over? 

For example, I was never a Taylor hater, but was very into “the scene”/anti country when Debut came out. I was aware of her singles, enjoyed them, but didn’t actively seek out her music. By the time 1989 rolled around, I was very good friends with someone who was a Swiftie and we would listen to 1989 a lot together, but I still never delved into her music beyond radio releases. 

When 2020 rolled around with Folkmore, I was moved on from my emo days but still heavily listening to indie rock and Folklore specifically blew me away. My older daughter (5) started to really get into her music (mostly 1989) around the time that Red TV came out and I simultaneously became obsessed with ATW10MVTV. In an effort to *not* listen to Shake It Off on repeat, I started to play her full discography and thus my respect grew. 

My older daughter and I stayed up for Midnights together and then when the Eras Tour was announced and one of the dates aligned with her birthday, I was able to snag tickets to take her. 

I really do credit both of my girls for my own exploration of her music, and it’s such a fun thing to share with them. 

What about everyone else who came late to the game?

But in Clean, in the first line ""The drought was the VERY worst"", she sings ""very"" with an ""f"" sound, almost like ""fairy"". As Taylor is very meticulous in most things she does, I don't think it's an accident. Unfortunately, I haven't found any discussion about or explanation for it online. Have I missed anything? Is there some kind of accent, an allusion, pun etc. hidden? What do you think?

I know, this isn't the most important question, but it's one that comes up in my head every time I listen to the song.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/158dxqy/why_does_taylor_pronounce_very_the_way_she_does/,"Why does Taylor pronounce ""very"" the way she does in Clean?",TaylorSwift,t3_158dxqy,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/158dxqy/why_does_taylor_pronounce_very_the_way_she_does/,2023-07-24 15:31:16,Taylor Swift,0.25084448

"Since the “breakup” with Joe, we have seen Taylor spotted holding hands with a variety of both men (Matty, Travis) and plenty of women (Gigi, Blake, Sophie, Zoë, Cara)… and I am sure I am even missing some here. Not one photo has been taken of her doing anything more physically intimate (kissing, etc.), only random quotes from “sources” saying they saw her kiss Matty and Travis. In addition, photos showing Travis and Matty staying the night at her apartment… well guess what, so have Sophie and Cara and she openly quarantined with Zoë for who knows how long!

I feel like this is her clearly sending a message. The general public reads in to *almost* everything she does, just as long as it is through a het-lens. She is effectively seen doing the SAME. EXACT. BEHAVIOR. with both men and women, often times moreso with women, yet the media only seem to speculate on the men. Taylor makes the intentional choice to not make comments on any of these reports or articles, but is equally intentional with making sure she is spotted giving the same level of affection to multiple genders. 

What do we think her message is with this? I suppose you could argue that she could be sending a message regardless of her sexual preference/orientation, and maybe she is just trying to feed both sides of her fanbase (hetlors and gaylors), or (in my opinion) she’s trying to send a bigger message to society that “hey, queer women exist and the media ignores it”.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GaylorSwift/comments/17cf34q/handholding_her_making_a_point/,Handholding: her making a point,GaylorSwift,t3_17cf34q,/r/GaylorSwift/comments/17cf34q/handholding_her_making_a_point/,2023-10-20 16:17:57,Taylor Swift,0.3048984

Of course there would be songs that will sound like hers since there are millions of songs in existence already and only limited chords and flows are available so it’s bound to happen.

"If any of you have bought from the UK merch store recently, you'll probably also have received like a thousand emails saying that products have been delayed. It happens to everything I order, and it's driving me crazy! I cancelled my Eras blanket order because they said they couldn't even give an estimate of the release date anymore after several delays, and today I think I reached my breaking point lol - I had an email at 18:01 saying my orders were delayed until the 15th of September, and then, *fifteen minutes later*, another email saying they're now delayed until the 13th of October. Bear in mind, they were originally due to be released on the 20th of July, so they're now delayed by three months.

So, my question is: does the US merch store also have these massive, frequent delays? In future, should I just order from the US merch store and pay the extra shipping costs? I've ordered a couple of things from there before, and they've actually arrived early, so I'm very tempted.

"I just had a discussion with my boyfriend about Taylor Swifts song credits. Because she’s so big right now and has been for many years which means that she as a brand generates a ton of money, my bf thinks that she’s not actually writing her own songs. And that there’s a big machinery behind her who writes her albums. And she’s just credited as the writer because that’s her main USP. I was actually quite shocked because I always assumed and believed (if you look at her song credits) that she writes everything herself. He, on the other hand, thinks that’s just very naive thinking. Now I’m actually wondering if it’s true that she writes everything or has a big production company/ghost writers behind her. What do you think?

"Hello everyone,

As you may know, Reddit has recently made changes to its API which includes new fees for third-party app developers. This has resulted in pushback from thousands of subreddits, many of which are undergoing closures that will last indefinitely. The API changes have resulted in a number of third-party apps announcing their closures, including Apollo and Reddit Is Fun. In protest of these changes, we (and a lot of other subreddits) are considering continuing being private. However, we will open up towards the end of each week to allow for tour discussion and planning, for the remainder of The Eras Tour. We believe that this is an important issue that affects all of us and we want to make sure that our voices are heard. We would like to hear your thoughts on this matter and whether you think we should remain closed or not.

"I’ve been thinking about the promotion of GUTS recently and I find it interesting how different it is from SOUR. 

SOUR follows the more traditional route of a big album release. Her label did an amazing job leading up to the album. Deja Vu and Good 4 u are great single choices showing off her versatility as an artist. Especially when good 4 u went straight to number 1 a week before the album dropped. We also got SO MANY performances of DL. At the Brits, Talk shows, SNL…etc. After that we have SOUR prom, the Disney documentary. 

which leads me to the promo for GUTS. It seems like Olivia and the label is taking a different approach this time. Only two singles before the album, close to zero live performances. It seems like they really trusted the fan base, or is it because Olivia was too overwhelmed by the instant success of Sour she wanted to chill things out this time? Which is totally understandable, she talks quite often about how the instant fame affected.

I still really like the cardigan so I would just like to know if somebody else has fallen for this and if they have received their orders… I feel so dumb but I have severe anxiety and honestly I don’t feel like making a mess even if the merch ends up being bad I’ll just deal with it, but does it at least arrive?",https://i.redd.it/q3dn58kfriib1.jpg,I got scammed (taylowswiftmerch.com),TaylorSwiftMerch,t3_15sykbb,/r/TaylorSwiftMerch/comments/15sykbb/i_got_scammed_taylowswiftmerchcom/,2023-08-16 18:55:18,Taylor Swift,0.15932569

"\*\*\***The two separate weekly threads that were going on in this subreddit have been merged for now. Feel free to comment any separate or combined ISOs, items for sale, and items for trade on this weekly post.\*\*\***

&#x200B;

**ISO:**

All ISO related posts should be commented in this megathread from now on. *Individual ISO posts will be removed.*

&#x200B;

**SELLING & TRADING:**

Please review the [selling](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwiftMerch/wiki/selling) & [trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwiftMerch/wiki/trading) rules before commenting. As a reminder, your Reddit account should be at least one month old if you want to sell or trade.

The *basic* rules are (but PLEASE review the full rules):

* **You MUST upload a photo of the items you are trading or selling** \- No stock images or images that are not yours. You can upload images to Imgur and share the link in a comment on this post. **THIS ALSO APPLIES TO TRADE OFFERS. Comment with a photo of your item you are offering to trade before private messaging.**
   * Any very RARE items should have a photo with a handwritten timestamp (your Reddit username and the date handwritten on a piece of paper).
   * i.e. ""Record Store Days"" Vinyl Records, 'Lover' Snow Globe, Signed Items, and Lithographs
* If you are interested in a sale or trade, comment ""Sent a private message to you. I accept your listed price or I have X item to trade"" so the moderator(s) know who is reaching out to who.
* No ""Taking offers"" comments - **Items being sold must have a clear price**. If anyone tries to sell something to you ABOVE their listed price - please let the moderators know.
   * If you want to negotiate a lower price or offer something else that is not an ISO, please do so in the comments first.
   * Insane price gouging is not allowed.
   * If you are unsure about the value of an item, feel free to make a post with the ""Fair Trade/Value Question"" flair.
* ***Please edit your comment once you've accepted an offer and tag the user you are selling or trading to.***
* **No trade or sale sniping** \- If an offer is accepted, other members should wait 24 hours before commenting to ask if the transaction went through. If two users make the same offer, the person who offered first gets priority.

There are a lot of scammers out there or bad sellers so these rules are in place to help protect the members of this subreddit. There are new members joining every day and some people are completely new to Reddit. No worries if you make some mistakes. PLEASE be wary about selling or trading to *ANYONE* who does not want to follow these rules (i.e. not uploading a photo and listing a clear price).",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwiftMerch/comments/146tery/61123_iso_selling_and_trading_megathread/,"6/11/23 - ISO, Selling, and Trading Megathread",TaylorSwiftMerch,t3_146tery,/r/TaylorSwiftMerch/comments/146tery/61123_iso_selling_and_trading_megathread/,2023-06-11 13:02:29,Taylor Swift,0.024378212

" I’m using a burner account because I know I will actually get crucified. But who cares. I just want to say something to my community right now. I’m a veteran swiftie, I’ve been there since 2009 and I’ve been a gaylor since then as well. It’s been a long, long ass time. And honestly, the gaylor community had never been this shitty since TTB’s golden age. 

And look, I think reddit is actually one of the better places. I think there’s still thoughtful discussions, respectful people, of course. But damn, I’m seeing more and more stupid shit every day. And not even “just” stupid, but people taking things way too seriously. People are fighting in trenches and doing all the mental gymnastics needed because they can’t fathom that Taylor might not be this or that, people are forgetting all their critical thinking. Gaylor used to be a community made of smart people digging for the truth, trying to sharpen their comprehension skills for fuck’s sake.  

Not only am I seeing folks being super aggressive for no reasons, taking shots at people unprovoked, just because they disagree or got something wrong, but also the “theories” are getting way too wild. So many people in this community are, with all due respect, not informed. How many people did I see in the past few days scratching their heads trying to prove that Taylor is using Kelce as a PR boyfriend like their lives depend on it,  grammygate, LSK … People are saying the dumbest shit I’ve seen in years right now and the reason for that, the actual reason, is because some folks in this community are upset she’s “dating” a man. That’s the truth, stay mad. If you need to come up with 150 weird theories to prove something then maybe it’s a sign that you’re reaching my dear.  This community is lacking NUANCE right now. And it’s wild because that’s precisely the reason why it used to be great to talk about things with gaylors, because we were more nuanced about stuff. 

But also, and above all, the climate is so hostile at the moment. Like I said Reddit gaylors are usually more chill, but tumblr ? twitter ? tiktok ? Some of us need to take several seats, seriously. It’s actually sad, I’ve met wonderful and smart and thoughtful people in this community, people used to be less invested with the whole thing, less serious about it. 

May I remind the gaylors that this is about **art.** Now this feels more like a political agenda than people reuniting to have thoughtful discussion about an artist that they like. And make no mistake, I’m a lesbian myself, I know about the political meaning of what we’re doing, but that wasn’t what this community was before. Do we have to be so focused on this ? Do we have to take everything so damn seriously ? Taylor’s just a popstar, it’s literally fine. And the thing is, because people are being militant about it, they become aggressive. And now no matter how interesting our content may be, no matter if we’re right, no matter how smart our explanations can get, people are not interested and will not engage with us because we’re acting like assholes and crazy people. I mean, what a shame. That’s not a cult, it’s not like I want people to join, but gaylorism is genuinely so interesting. 

That’s the attitude, the attitude needs to change. The smugness of certain people, the aggressiveness, is annoying. This community is becoming annoying and unwelcoming. So can we please sit down and think it through for a second. If you’re a Gaylor then you should be ready to accept that Taylor may not be what you want her to be. She may not be a lesbian, she may not be a bisexual, she may not be dating the people that YOU like, she may not be what YOU want her to be. Right now it's about her being with Travis, but it's the same with everything else. So what if she's bisexual ? So what if she's not ? Do we need this negativity ? I don't think so.

"When they compare her old photos with the new ones saying “ she aged like a fine wine “ 
In my opinion she dose look more mature than she was when was 19, beautifully but i think it’s just some fans make it seem like she’s 80 years old, she’s only 33 years old very young and still is youthful of course she won’t age like a granny 😅😅
I don’t know but maybe it’s just my opinion, I think she aged naturally because she’s not even old at all, I am unsure how people except women in their 30s and mid 20s to look like because I am 26 and people still get shock to know my real age assuming I am much younger, also very often people call women who dose not have so much wrinkles «  aged like a fine wine «  but if she had wrinkles they will say «  aged like a milk «  which’s sad and is misogyny to me, women only get praised if she did not age but as soon as she truly age later they will say «  oh she ike a milk «  no she aged like a human and Taylor is still far for being old but I assume fans who are shocked why didn’t she look so old are fans who are in their teen years.

"Hi! I’ve been mulling over this all day and I wanted to get your opinions. How early should I get to my local record store tomorrow morning? I had to work last year and missed out on “The Lakes” 7”. I made sure to take off tomorrow and even stopped in to talk to the guy who runs the record shop last month. I asked him the same question I’m asking you and he told me that he should have enough in stock and if I get there when it opens I should be fine. HOWEVER, people on Twitter are making me nervous because I’m seeing these lines of people camping outside of their record stores across the country. I can’t do that and I wouldn’t want to because of the area my record store is in. Should I be worried I won’t get a copy?

Edit #1: first record store had a line two and a half city blocks long. Trying my luck at the one I usually go to 🤞🏻🤞🏻🤞🏻

Edit #2: In line at the second one and there’s maybe like 20 people here 🥳🥳🥳

"Im hosting an Eras Tour Party in Minnesota the weekend of the Minneapolis concert 🎶 

I love the variety of foods you can find on a good charcuterie board. 

I’ve come up with a few ideas for snacks that can tie into the Eras or songs on specific albums….but I’d love ideas from other people as well

Here are my ideas so far:
Candy Hearts for Lover 
Waffle Cone Crackers for Coney Island
Blackberry Jam for Reputation 
Purple Jam for Speak Now
Deviled Eggs for Fearless 
White Cheeses for Folklore 
Gold Chocolate Coins for Gold Rush 
Beef Jerky (because of the cowboy history) for Cowboy like me or Debut 
Green Apple Slices - Debut 
Jell-O filled syringes for Bad Blood
Red Velvet Cookies/Cake for Red

"Being Thanksgiving, we have had a lot of family in town. Today my mother-in-law (she can be a bit critical, but love her) commented “so do you only listen to Taylor Swift in your house?” Mind you, my toddler daughter is obsessed with her, and yes, I always ask Alexa to play her in the kitchen.

I tried to explain that she has a 10-album discography, plus she’s created music across multiple genres, so it’s like listening to different music every album. She replied that her voice sounds the same in every song. Fair point, but I argued that the last three albums have sounded, voice-wise and genre-wise, very different than what others would consider ‘traditional’ Taylor Swift (Midnights is my favorite album).

This was all without her seeing what I listen to in the car (recently, according to my iPhone, all TS).

I’ve heard from other Swift fans that they often play only TS in their houses. My beloved aunt confirmed this while visiting her over the summer (she is partial to the Speak Now Era, like my sister, who also primarily plays TS in her house).

Anyone else only seem to play Taylor Swift in their house? Car? Life? In general? If not, or if so, what else do you like to listen to and why?

"I love Seven so much. It deserves more hype, it’s both a beautiful and hauntingly painful song. I believe that it might be written from two povs, and I’m wondering what everyone’s thoughts are. 

&#x200B;

From the pov of young Taylor’s friend, who is being abused:

&#x200B;

Please picture me in the trees

I hit my peak at seven

Feet in the swing over the creek

I was too scared to jump in

But I, I was high in the sky

With Pennsylvania under me

Are there still beautiful things?

Sweet tea in the summer

Cross your heart won’t tell no other

And though I can’t recall your face

I’ve still got love for you

Your braids like a pattern

Love you to the moon and to Saturn

Passed down like folk songs

The love lasts so long

&#x200B;

From young Taylor’s pov:

&#x200B;

And I’ve been meaning to tell you 

I think your house is haunted 

Your dad is always mad and that must be why

And I think you should come live with me 

And we can be pirates

Then you won’t have to cry

Or hide in the closet

And just like a folk song

Our love will be passed on

Please picture me in the weeds

Before I learned civility 

I used to scream ferociously

Any time I wanted

I, I 

Sweet tea in the summer

Cross my heart won’t tell no other

And though I can’t recall your face

I’ve still got love for you

Pack your dolls and a sweater

We’ll move to India forever 

Passed down like folk songs

Our love lasts so long

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\*The first part  says “cross YOUR heart”, the second says “cross MY heart”

&#x200B;

 The first part paints a picture of fear and loss 

&#x200B;

The second part sounds like a young child reassuring their friend

&#x200B;

The first part says “your braids like a pattern” we’ve seen pictures of little Taylor in braids

&#x200B;

Both parts sound like adults reflecting on their younger selves, the thoughts they had, and the words they said

&#x200B;

“I used to scream ferociously” could be referring to the anger young Taylor felt at finding out her friend was being abused, and only seeing the situation as black and white, before she grew up and learned how complicated things can be

"The charity ticket thing was insane.  For Orlando, it looked like the entire floor, pit, and half the lower bowls were charity platinum.  Not only did this seem a bit sleazy, especially because we couldn’t find out how much money was actually going to charity, but it artificially inflated the prices of the rest of the seats.  

Lower bowl tix way off to the side (that I would’ve guessed would be $150 max if the ACTUAL high end was $199) were $195 w/o fees.

"Just realized while watching the Eras Tour Movie:

This sentence in the Time interview about how, following Snake-gate, Taylor avoided phone calls (bold text added for emphasis, other sentences included for context) :
>“That took me down psychologically to a place I’ve never been before. I moved to a foreign country. I didn’t leave a rental house for a year. ***I was afraid to get on phone calls.*** I pushed away most people in my life because I didn’t trust anyone anymore. I went down really, really hard.” 

Exactly mirrors the iconic line from Look What You Made Me Do:
>“The old Taylor can’t come to the phone right now.  Why?  Cause she’s DEAD!”

So: she wrote a line that plainly sounds like an apt metaphor for self-reinvention about not coming to the phone, at a time when she was ACTUALLY dodging phone calls in real life.  ^two ^meanings! ^Her ^mind…!",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/18ht7q2/the_old_taylor_cant_come_to_the_phone_right_now/,The old Taylor can’t come to the phone right now…,TaylorSwift,t3_18ht7q2,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/18ht7q2/the_old_taylor_cant_come_to_the_phone_right_now/,2023-12-13 22:33:14,Taylor Swift,0.10956833

"# May God help me handle this post


Hey everyone!


I'm so sorry that this was SO, SO delayed. Life has been.... hectic lately, to say the least, but THANK YOU FOR WAITING because today is a special day. Today, I'll be posting round FOUR of Four Corners. As the title suggested, this round we'll be focusing on taylor swift's fourth studio album, RED (TV), EXCLUDING HER VAULT TRACKS (which will be done separately). Four Corners is a game I invented where you cast your votes for your four most opposing opinions on an album. Let me break this down. Imagine, there are four corners on a metaphorical chart, and you must rank one song in each of the corners. I'll describe these corners the best that I can:


Best: A song that is your personal favorite, whether or not it's a popular opinion.


Overrated: A song that you feel is favored too highly, whether or not you love/hate it.


Underrated: A song that you feel is favored too lowly, whether or not you love/hate it.


Worst: A song that is your personal least favorite, whether or not it's a popular opinion.


If you participated in the previous rounds, thank you so much! I couldn't believe how many responses I got. I really hope you enjoyed playing half as much as I enjoyed reading and responding to your answers... even if it actually took me the rest of last year. Happy (late) 2023! It means a lot that some of you have been so appreciative of this little game. I really didnt expect it to blow up the way it did, but it did, and I'm so glad that it did. This game has really been the highlight of my life lately. Enough about my sappy sentiments, though- I have tallied up the results from the last round and crowned the four corners of the public. Here are the results:


*Best song: Enchanted!* A surprise to no one, this long time fan favorite won with a whopping 25 votes! (Over 1/4 of participants.) An incredibly well composed standout in an album of standouts, in a career built on standing out. The production, melody, lyrics, and vocals are nothing sort of enchanting. It's no wonder it's one of the songs that got me as into Taylor's music as I am today. Honorary mention to the runner up, Long Live (tied for first place in my heart, with Haunted.) Congratulations to these two amazing and ethereal anthems!


*Most Overrated: Mean!* Mean claimed the dishonorable title with a total of 14 votes. Although I didn't pick it, it's not very high on my ranking compared to a lot of the other gems hidden in this album, so I totally get it. Honestly, I regret putting the song that I did, and I wish i had put Mean (or a different song...) But all that being said, all of us haters? All we are is mean, and all liars, and pathetic, and alone in life... PS, the runner up was the ""best song"" pick, Enchanted! Which... makes sense, lol, considering the votes, lmao.


*Most Underrated: Haunted!* I am PLEASED to announce that Haunted won what was DEFINITELY the most narrow round so far, one that had me, *ohh, holding my breath,* until the last vote was counted. With a lucky 13 votes, the force of nature that is Haunted won the underrated vote of the public. It's an atmospheric, emotional, and an incredibly unique experience wrapped neatly into one haunting head banger. Tied for first place off the album in my personal vote, so I'm very happy. Speaking of being happy, the runner up was Innocent! THAT was a massive shock to me, but a very welcomed one. It really is *never too late to be brand new!* :)


*Worst: Superman.* A surprise to absolutely no one, *I watched Superman fly away* with an abhorrent 38 VOTES. 38. THIRTY. EIGHT. It's definitely not a favorite of mine. It's not my least favorite either. I get it. Some complained it was cheesy, some said it lacked complexity. I can't fully disagree. Its still a bop though, and *I loved it from the very first day!* Sadly, Innocent was also the runner up this round. For that one, I KNOW *some of y'all* are still growing up now... right?...


Why do I hear Anti-Hero in the distance? 💀 


With that all said and done, it's time to move onto round number four. Which songs will you pick for your four corners? The rules are, that you CANNOT include vault songs; you CAN pick the same songs more than once, and do ties ONLY if you really really cant pick; and starting here, you must pick an answer for all 4 questions, or NONE of your votes will be included in the tally. Please be nice, respectful, and most importantly, have fun! I'll try to have the next round out a lot sooner. Thanks for sticking around and participating in this with me. It really means so much more than anyone of you know. Lots of love. 


Have an amazing 2023!!! 


P.S: I went a little overboard with my responses to the comments last time. As much as I enjoyed it, it waaas kind of exhausting. I'm going to be under much more stress these next few weeks, lol, so im going to *attempt* to keep my responses a bit more brief this time, not much more than the length of the comment I'm responding to...

"This is an off topic question but doesn’t Taylor need to release all of her re records before the eras tour? It doesn’t make much sense to me that she would be doing a tour based on all of them when we only have two. Her fans are going to want to fresh’n up on all of her discography before the tour and that is going to add streams of the old ones. 

Don’t get me wrong I am excited for all of the fans that got tickets but shouldn’t she be doing this later and do a midnights tour first?

"i dont know if thats what my title should be, but its a genuine question. i have been a fan over taylor way before she started re-recording her music, and as much as i love that shes re-recording her catalog, the new ones just dont have the same emotion as the original ones because shes matured and grown from those experiences. i felt connected to the emotions she had in her songs as i felt i could relate to her aswell, and i dont want to stream her old music because i know scooter would be getting money from it.

i use apple music, its very easy to import music files into your library on your computer (i use apple music preview, not iTunes). i used the Youtube2MP3 website to download the music file in itself for lets say haunted, and when i put it into my library and play it, once it finishes it seems like it counts as a stream towards the actual song from the speak now 2010 on airbuds (the app i use to see my and my friends played music history). i absolutely do not want to give scooter a dime, so i have refrained from trying that again, but i just really dont understand why it does that and thats why i came here asking if anybody knows how i can listen to the old songs without giving scooter any $$$? i still listen to taylor's version as i want her to get the money of course, but i still wanna listen to her old catalog :(",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/16l5gfm/how_can_i_stream_taylors_old_music_without_giving/,how can i stream taylor's old music without giving scoot a dime?,TaylorSwift,t3_16l5gfm,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/16l5gfm/how_can_i_stream_taylors_old_music_without_giving/,2023-09-17 16:40:53,Taylor Swift,0.11109332

"I have a theory that summer may be a metaphor for a time when Taylor is possibly under some kind of contract or maybe before she comes out to the general public (if that is her plan)- possibly the time between 2019-when she finishes re-recording her albums.  

I’m was curious if anybody else has thought about Betty being a metaphor for Taylor’s authentic self/queer identity/maybe even the LGBTQ community. Perhaps August is a metaphor for fame and for the time she’s had thus far being in the public spotlight while hiding her true self. And then if James is a metaphor for current Taylor, Cardigan could be the true Taylor singing to the Taylor we currently know now, who had to hide that part of herself to get to the level of fame that she’s at now.

I’ve been analyzing work Taylor has done since 2019 through a lens of the different versions of Taylor, thanks to the Anti-Hero music video. Would love to hear about your thoughts on this theory and any other potential metaphors related to this theory. 

P.S. I do like and believe the theories involving Betty and/or August being muses and that’s been my belief for a long time, so this theory isn’t meant to discredit those theories, just looking at some other perspectives to try and give me some hope right now haha.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GaylorSwift/comments/17ebd95/bettyjamesaugust_and_summer_metaphors/,Betty/James/August and summer metaphors,GaylorSwift,t3_17ebd95,/r/GaylorSwift/comments/17ebd95/bettyjamesaugust_and_summer_metaphors/,2023-10-23 03:43:15,Taylor Swift,0.1587729

"So I was thinking and if I was Taylor, since it's coming soonish, I would probably leave the debut album for last- to release it on its 20th anniversary.
I mean we all know she has a reasoning behind how the albums would be released and this would be a cool thing to do in my opinion as a nice way to celebrate her music. At this point it seems like it might happen since we still have more Taylor's versions comming and only about 3 years to anniversary.

What do you think? Do you think Taylor planned to own all her music on 20th anniversary of first album release?

"new fan here and i wanna talk about two things i noticed in the music video for brutal i apologize if they've been posted about before!

1. near the beginning of the video a man saying ""Choose your character"" can be heard (incorrectly subtitled as ""Choose your player"") this audio is actually the announcer from Super Smash Bros Melee for the GameCube
2. the tv seen during the line ""...And I'm so caught up in the news"" is actually a tv that was owned by a prisoner, here's how i know this: its made of clear plastic and has no speaker despite the presence of the speaker grill, prisoners can earn money during their time there to buy things and get to keep those things when they get out, so on occassion things like these tvs will end up in thrift stores or online sales. 

&amp;#x200B;

edit: for some extra context on the tv, its clear so that prisoners can't hide things inside of it, its ultrasonically welded (no screws holding it together) not sure what the specific reason for this is but it is part of the regulation for prison tech, the reason for not including the speaker is so the sound won't bother guards or other inmates you would have to use headphones or closed captions with it (some prison tech like radios do include speakers but they're much quieter than on the kind you'd get from a store, just loud enough to hear if you hold it up to your ear)",https://www.reddit.com/r/OliviaRodrigo/comments/1110rsm/brutal_music_video/,Brutal music video,OliviaRodrigo,t3_1110rsm,/r/OliviaRodrigo/comments/1110rsm/brutal_music_video/,2023-02-13 05:47:06,Olivia Rodrigo,0.24282593
"“No one is this good and works harder. And if you’re that good you don’t work that hard.”

I was watching Miss Americana recently and I feel like this quote sums up Taylor perfectly! She has benefited from many forms of privilege but the two most important things behind her success are her undeniable talent coupled with her insane work ethic. 

Jack is spot on when he says there are others out there who are as talented as her, but no one else puts in the same amount of work as Taylor Swift. She pushes and pushes to be the best (for better or worse), consistently outdoing herself commercially and critically. She has help with this of course from a loyal team of experts that she has built over the years but it’s clear Taylor is the mastermind (ahem) behind it all.

I think the main driver behind this can be heard in songs like mirrorball. Taylor’s natural introspection and self critical tendencies make her hyper-aware of the tenuous nature of fame, so she never takes anything for granted and works harder than anyone else to keep it.

Just thought this was a perfect quote to sum up Taylor, it goes to show that she and Jack have an amazing bond.

" I'm seeing a lot of hate going on between fandoms this summer. As someone who was really lucky (and now really broke) to see both Taylor Swift and Beyonce (just saw her this weekend and WOW), it's blowing my mind how we live in a world where these two artists are putting on the best concerts of their careers so far and a lot of the headlines or online discussions comes down to who's doing it best.

It's human nature to compare and contrast. I'e never been personally picky about who needs to be #1 in my book. But the wrath of stans going after everyone and everything who does not listen to their fave on repeat forever is obsessive gate-keeping that's not healthy or give either artist a good look - not only are critics getting attacked on social media but also dancers who post going to another artists tour when honestly everyone is just trying to have a good time. Some dancers end up muting the comments or blacking out their social media because of the hate. Why do people do this to each other when Taylor and Beyonce are just living their lives? lol It seems like such a waste of time and hurtful energy to out there, and totally counter-productive to the messages they want their fans to have.

I'm a hardcore admirer of both women, and to me, there is just no way to compare them since both tours focus on different themes and music (Renaissance is disco/house celebrating LGBTQ+, Eras is a Greatest Hits tour taking us on Taylor's journey), the set-up is unique to each one, and everyone who attends are just looking to have a good time. While I did feel that Renaissance was seamless 'cause it was one overall theme, I felt like I went to ten concerts in one night for Taylor, and both are valid experiences where they both come out on top.

I wanted to make this post and have it go out to anybody who loves Taylor and other artists as well - like don't be afraid to be a Swiftie or feel like you're less of a real fan just because you listen to more than one person or go to more than one concert - life is too short for gatekeeping your experiences or feel gatekept from doing more than one thing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/15uu9qm/we_can_like_taylor_and_beyonce_or_any_other/,We can like Taylor and Beyonce (or any other artist) at the same time,TaylorSwift,t3_15uu9qm,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/15uu9qm/we_can_like_taylor_and_beyonce_or_any_other/,2023-08-18 19:44:51,Taylor Swift,0.19124292

"In light of Taylor being at the Renaissance premiere in London today, I wanted to talk a little bit about her relationship to Beyoncé.

Idk how many of you consider yourselves part of the beyhive in addition to being a swiftie / gaylor but I definitely do! In the beyhive, many of us believe B has been 🌈 flagging us on the Renaissance album and with her tour visuals this past year.

Songs like Cozy and Thique have been interpreted by many of us to be signaling her bisexuality. Of course, there are a lot of 🐝 stans, not unlike the hetlor community, that thinks us identifying possible queer flagging on her part as inappropriate and disrespectful, sadly.

Beyoncé and Taylor both have a great professional friendship clearly and part of me wonders if Tay has clued B in on her plan to come out (whether that’s as bi or gay). And as a Beyoncé fan who believes she has been queerflagging her bisexuality, I’m thinking about everyone who’s been talking about a mass industry coming out that Taylor is masterminding and if B is part of that!",https://www.reddit.com/r/GaylorSwift/comments/187qogv/beyoncé_taylor_mass_coming_out_theory/,Beyoncé + Taylor (mass coming out theory),GaylorSwift,t3_187qogv,/r/GaylorSwift/comments/187qogv/beyoncé_taylor_mass_coming_out_theory/,2023-11-30 19:22:50,Taylor Swift,0.27047762

"I'm thinking of making some Taylor Swift/Lord of the Rings (or Tolkien) comparisons. Would these make sense? (I'll add more to each comparison if you would like it)

What songs do you think would correspond to various points in *Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, or The Silmarillon?*

*The Lord of the Rings*

""It's Nice to Have a Friend"": Sam to Frodo. Sam is considered one of the most dependable allies or friends someone can have. Also the Gimli and Legolas friendship. They were originally distrusting of each other, but soon gained each other's respect.

""Bigger Than The Whole Sky"": Frodo/The Hobbits finding the Shire almost dead due to Saruman and his minions in the Scouring of the Shire. This could also apply to Sam finding Frodo unconscious and fearing the worst in an earlier point. 

""Happiness"": Frodo to Middle Earth itself. He realizes that there was happiness to be found there, but after the adventure of the Ring, Frodo can no longer find happiness in Middle Earth and sets across the Sea. 

""My Tears Ricochet"": Gandalf to Saruman after the latter has betrayed the White Council. This is self-explanatory. 

""The Archer"": Legolas character analysis... 

""Long Live"": The War of the Ring, and how its deeds will live forever. 

&amp;#x200B;

*The Silmarillion* 

Scooter Braun comparison to Morgoth (The Silmarillion). Yes, this is weird, but Morgoth had the ""Iron Crown"" where he had placed the Silmarils he had obtained. This seems oddly similar to the ""my pennies made your crown"" line from ""Karma"". Also, neither of them can create. For instance, Morgoth despite his immense power cannot create, only make hollow or corrupt versions of other creatures. (The song comparison here is ""Karma"")

There are probably a bunch of songs (""Enchanted"" is the first one that comes to mind) for Beren and Luthien. 

""Miss Americana and the Heartbreak Prince"": The Decline and Fall of Numenor. Two nations/imperial powers in decline (or perceived decline) and people's responses to it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/10k4xs4/taylor_swiftlord_of_the_rings_fans/,Taylor Swift/Lord of the Rings fans,TaylorSwift,t3_10k4xs4,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/10k4xs4/taylor_swiftlord_of_the_rings_fans/,2023-01-24 13:01:01,Taylor Swift,0.11088664

"Between having Travis in the VIP tent with Scott swift, changing the lyrics to “karma is the guy on the chiefs coming straight home to me,” pointing at Travis when she says “that’s my man,” and now this running up to him to kiss him nonsense, I’m left with one thought. And that thought is be fucking for real, Taylor. 

The kiss thing especially pissed me off because she is a 33 year old woman, not a 16 year old who just finished her school play. If he had taken 3 steps backward they would have had that moment in private. It’s so in my face it feels tongue in cheek. 

Comparing this showboating to when she kept looking at Karlie in the stands in LA, there’s no comparison. Watching her watch Karlie felt like an intrusion of an intimate event. This was unhinged honestly. Is this part of her plan? Am I supposed to feel so disgusted by this? Because as I’ve said in past posts, I don’t dislike Travis. I like that he has golden retriever energy and seems to worship her. I also want her to be happy. But it’s the in-your-face of it all which is leaving me aghast.

"I’ve had this lingering question in my head for years since the release of “Look what you made me do”. Why did she check it twice? I mean, wouldn’t it have sounded cooler if she had just checked it once and not cared enough to recheck? The fact that she checked it again just shows that the character's a dumb and forgetful type of bicth, not the badass cunning dominatrix image that she tried to portray.

"I think this lyric is a little more tongue in cheek than most people give it credit for. On one hand, it is obviously supposed to play off James’ “I don’t know anything” declaration in Betty to highlight their disparate maturity levels, but I also think it ties into the sentiment Taylor expresses in Nothing New (“How can a person know everything at 18, but nothing at 22?”) and tacitly serves as Betty’s (or at least Taylor’s) wry acknowledgment that her faith in the ultimate fate of relationship was on some level incorrect, even if Taylor does say in Long Pond that they ended up together.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/12gt1e9/i_knew_everything_when_i_was_young_in_cardigan/,“I knew everything when I was young” in Cardigan and Nothing New,TaylorSwift,t3_12gt1e9,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/12gt1e9/i_knew_everything_when_i_was_young_in_cardigan/,2023-04-09 19:28:29,Taylor Swift,0.17545098

"I'm a Girl At Home (OG) warrior and I'm here to tell you why.

**Lyrics**

In terms of lyricism, I have to say, I was very surprised to learn that people interpreted the ""if I was a stupid girl"" line as her saying that other girls are stupid. Because my interpretation was always that she's saying she wasn't born yesterday, and she can see through this guy's bullshit. I think she's comparing to herself back when she was more gullible. I really don't believe Taylor Swift, in her 4th round of media backlash, would release a bonus track saying other girls are stupid.

Additionally, what I like about GAH lyrics is that it ties so well with State Of Grace in the sense that it expresses her view of a moral code to love that should be followed, otherwise people will get hurt.

**Production**

Now, in terms of OG versus TV, people always say that Taylor's Version turned Girl At Home into a bop. But it was already a bop, just an acoustic guitar driven bop. And between the two bops, the OG one makes sense within the Red universe, it's as if Joni Mitchell was at a party. Red is not a synths album, so the TV one feels super out of place to me. And lord knows we would be fed synths in the following decade, so I very much appreciate this last taste of a real instrument bop.

Is anyone with me on this one??",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/14oufwk/in_defense_of_girl_at_home_og/,In defense of Girl At Home (OG),TaylorSwift,t3_14oufwk,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/14oufwk/in_defense_of_girl_at_home_og/,2023-07-02 17:49:47,Taylor Swift,0.50759226

I admit I’m not super tapped in to her world beyond the music, but have listened to her songs for a long time. 
With the announcement of speak now, I see a lot of commentary around John Mayer such as “pray for John”, “hell never recover” etc. 
My question is what are the perceived consequences? From what I witnessed, with Jake Gylenhall/All too well I saw articles about him in pop culture pubs and mainly felt it on social media (sometimes through and violent comments). 
So my questions are:
1) what do people expect to happen to JM

"So, I came about becoming a 69 year old fan through the economic impact she’s having. I too truly thought a lot of her music suffered from sameness (until I *really* started paying attention, that is). Today, I’m a confirmed fan and have been for about 6 months or so. Yeah, I’m *that* new.

By the time she arrived in my city (born and raised, still living in Washington), I was in awe. The earthquake 2 days in a row!) just clinched it. Then, she gave out the bonuses and then, she gave one of the largest, if not THE largest donation to our food bank. Shazam. We’re not even talkin’ about the concert yet!

I was introduced to her more and more by YouTube. Snippets of her songs. Over 6 months ago, I was irritated. What the hey?? WHY are they showing me *this.* (Trust me, it seemed like dozens of times/day.)

All Too Well pretty much shut me up. I dunno when they snuck that one in amongst the ones they were trying to get me to listen to. But I was a goner the second I heard this song. 

Now, one of the reasons I’m making this post is that, I’m also in awe of her management with her parents. I feel like they took the break to decide what worked and what did not. 

Number 1, I think possibly from good ol’ mom was utilizing Taylor herself. That’s easy to say. But the more I look at it, the more I realize that they appreciate Taylor for who she is. 

She wanted to remain true to herself. Not become a cynical famous hack. Clearly she’s done that. Clearly, she’s been in love with her fans from day 1. She hasn’t let that waver. 

In fact when the haters decided to hate, she realized that her fans remained loyal. And what she did? With that? She realized that her fan base was far more important than the haters. So different than the others that stage comebacks. Of them, it is demanded that they grovel and fit into a mold. You want back in You NEED to pay your dues. Taylor flipped that idea on its head!

That she’s a giving person. Instead of having beancounters *advise* her how to get every tax dollar out of her income taxes, she made sure to give to what SHE cares about. And there’s no press conference with bigger than life checks shown on all the entertainment or local news stations. This ain’t no lottery. And the receivers aren’t shown being overwhelmed by both Ms. Swift OR the media. We usually hear about it after the fact. 

Within the industry, she seems to love the play. The camaraderie. And she shows courage as well. Sharing All Too Well that first time could not have been easy. But share she did! Thankfully for us! 

The honestly in her songs pleases my heart. They deserved Reputation. And WE deserved it too. Lol. It must have been oh so fun to have been a fan after she disappeared and came back.  She surely did but under HER OWN STEAM. 

It is no secret that the media loves a good circus. And if it’s tearing down someone on high, so much the better. 

I feel like Taylor has figured it out. 

So much the better that she’s the #1 singer/songwriter NOT just the *female* singer/songwriter. She is THE richest best one.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/16zx5hf/i_am_so_pleased_with_taylors_success_this_is_why/,I am so pleased with Taylor’s success.

"Hello.

I am suggesting we, Adele fans and fan-equivalents, protest the Grammys.

Why you may ask?

They disrespect the artist. They spit on their legacy. They do not follow the artist’ wishes.

We cannot let the Grammys do this to Adele!

I believe we should begin with a grassroots campaign, by crafting a hashtag, #CancelGrammys.

Second, we should write many many tweets at industry contacts protesting the awards.

Third, we should picket outside of the Recording Academy.

"A big quote of Taylor's I can't get out of my mind lately is “People often greatly underestimate me on how much I’ll inconvenience myself to prove a point…” from the Tribeca Talks.

I was wondering which examples of this worked for better or worst her image, career, etc. ??

For me, re-recording her albums is an obvious one that works , even though it must be pain-staking to recreate every note and inflection. 

But a lot of her career has been based on choices about what she could or couldn't do (as she said in the billboard artist of the decade speech) is a mix of good and bad. It's amazing that she had the fortitude to write a whole album herself when people said she didn't write her own songs, or trying to be relationship-less for 1989 after everyone said that she was boy hungry...but at the same time, it's sad to think that a majority of her choices might've not been things she wanted to do but felt compelled to do to take a stand for her image/albums.

A funny one that works is Taylor turning the criticism of 'mmeeee-eeeee ooooh--ooohhhhh' in Me! to a softer version in invisible string - how it was cringey in one song but beautiful in another.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/151npd9/best_or_worst_examples_of_taylor_inconveniencing/,Best or worst examples of Taylor inconveniencing herself to prove a point?,TaylorSwift,t3_151npd9,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/151npd9/best_or_worst_examples_of_taylor_inconveniencing/,2023-07-17 01:20:44,Taylor Swift,0.10175867

"Hi Tokkis!
This is my first post on this sub. I feel sad. Part of what drove me to write this post is the fact that recently, two groups, Enhypen and (G)I-DLE, announced their world tour dates. But none of them feature Australian cities. So I thought to myself, surely ADOR won't let us down, right? An eventual Australian tour has been practically handed to them on a silver platter. So I ask you, what do you think a future Australian tour would and should look like, your expectations and the likely reality?

First off, I think that a spring tour would be best, so anywhere between late September to early November. They would avoid the bitterly cold winter, but also they would not have to deal with the draining heat of summer. Also I personally think spring has the most pleasant weather.

Now, probably the most important part: which cities should they visit? In my opinion, I think they should visit these cities, in this order: Perth - Adelaide - Melbourne - Sydney - Newcastle - Brisbane. This way, all the major cities get a fair go, whilst also maximizing the sentimental value. I also wish that they could spend a bit of time exploring each stop of their tour. 

As for the optimistic reality, they pull a TWICE and only visit Sydney and Melbourne. The pessimistic reality, is that they do a full-scale US, Asia and Europe tour and just forget Australia's existence. To the Aussies reading this, 2024 WILL be our year.

"Talks about the new National album, but there’s a fair bit about Taylor and the Grammys, Folklore and Evermore and other stuff

The big takeaways:

Extremely complementary about Taylor as a songwriter and even more so as a person: “fundamentally the same kind person whether she’s making dinner or in the spotlight”

They wrote and recorded Would’ve Could’ve Should’ve (which he calls the best thing they’ve written together), Hits Different and High Infidelity at Taylor’s house during his visit for the Folklore Grammys

Gets caught a bit by the interviewer on whether he’s still working with Taylor. Says he’s not at liberty to say but then says she’s so prolific and he’s so prolific and they’re always bouncing ideas around and the exchange of ideas is ‘ongoing’

"Years from now, we will still be here, existing in our small corner of the internet. While others will slowly lose interest in her or in her music. 

Maybe they will no longer speculate when she settles down with someone maybe they will not find her as intriguing or interesting without all the drama surrounding her, but we will still be here sharing.

Maybe it will be with nostalgia ‘Hey, remember when she released Me! Out now! On lesbian visibility day? or when she talked about kissing lips so scarlet it was maroon or hundreds of things in her songs and pictures.

The Gaylors have existed for over a decade now despite all the backlash and will continue to exist for decades. 

In a way, we are her most loyal fans as we have remained loyal to her and her music despite her never truly protecting or acknowledging us. Will the others still stay if she does the same to them?

"Taylor is a genius when it comes to songwriting. I am glad that the whole world is recognising this. However I still don’t see people appreciating the melody she comes up with! They are as good as her lyrics. You can put any type of production with her melodies and the song would still rock. Plus you can sing basic lyrics with her melodies and the song will still slaps. I do not like ballads and slow songs but Folklore is my favourite album o all time. When I first heard it, i kinda discarded it because I don’t like slow stuff. However I found myself singing  or humming the melodies to the songs later on, they kept on replaying in my mind till I actually fell in love with all the songs.  What are y’all thoughts?

"We love the eras tour but sometimes I think it’s a little…. Self absorbed? Of Taylor. 

I hate to say that because on one hand these songs she singing aren’t about her anymore, they’ve become connections she has made to fans for years and years. But on the other hand I wonder a lot about the pathology of touring artists. I feel like if I had to perform so many of things that I created, I’d get so effing tired of myself. So I more than anything wish I could pic Taylor’s brain to see how the processes all of the things that go into touring and playing all this giant load of songs new and old. I think touring artists in general could very well actually be just ego maniacs who are way too absorbed with themselves. Just makes me wonder where all the energy truly comes from. 

Sometimes I wish we just got a Lover tour and a Folkmore tour separately. It makes me sad to think those three albums won’t have their full moment in the sun the same way the other eras have. Even midnights is being promoted and spun around the sun like normal, it’s unique the way all the albums came out in recent year but I wish they had the attention the same way as others. I especially kinda wish folkmore was it’s own separate tour because there are SO MANY amazing songs and reducing these albums to just four songs is so sad. The other albums didn’t have that. 

I’m imagining now what it would’ve been like had she had the first half of the tour dedicated to exploring Lover like it was supposed to be and the second half exploring Folkmore and she could’ve titled the second, “The Woodvale Tour” 

I just wish we could spend more time in the forest with her sometimes.

Edit: so what I’m hearing is….. y’all are totally down for this and hate the fact that she’s doing the eras and also fully agree with my entertaining the idea that touring artists are self absorbed. Calm down with the upvotes I swear.  

No but really, y’all can try rereading if you don’t understand the hypothetical scenario and alternate perspective I wrote about here if you want, or you can all jump on me for saying Taylor might be self absorbed and explaining why I said that as if condemned her to death.

I was listening to Glitch recently and I realized the “woahhh woahhh woahhh” part in the middle sounds an awful lot like the synthesizer (I think that’s what it is, though I’m not great at recognizing instruments) in the first part of Band on The Run…. 

The song itself, according to Wikipedia, was inspired by two things: one, wanting to escape the boring, tedious business meetings the Beatles had to be involved in because of how big enterprise they had become, and issues related to their Apple company; and two, musicians getting busted for marijuana and feeling like they were being seen as criminals for something relatively minor. I think we can see a parallel to Taylor’s life in the first point based on the glimpses we saw in Miss Americana. It seems like every decision of Taylor’s has to be approved by some sort of board and there’s likely many tedious meetings around album releases, marketing, tours, etc. And the second point… well, Lavender Haze seems to connect well there. Besides the bearding themes, it definitely seems like Taylor smokes weed, though she definitely hasn’t been in trouble over it.

Somewhat inspired by the recent post (https://www.reddit.com/r/GaylorSwift/comments/yk82ni/i_think_paul_mccartney_is_wb_or_at_least_inspired/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf ) that presented a theory that Paul McCartney is William Bowery. I’m not saying this confirms this theory (I’m also on the fence about it and just find it interesting) but it definitely shows that Taylor is influence by Paul, I think.

Bonus point: Paul McCartney also wrote and acted in the musical “Give My Regards to Broad Street”: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Give_My_Regards_to_Broad_Street_(film) (he didn’t direct it, though). This might be another aspect of Paul’s career Taylor is hoping to emulate with her upcoming feature film.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GaylorSwift/comments/11dw6an/glitch_sounds_an_awful_lot_like_the_first_part_of/,Glitch sounds an awful lot like the first part of “Band on the Run” by Paul McCartney,GaylorSwift,t3_11dw6an,/r/GaylorSwift/comments/11dw6an/glitch_sounds_an_awful_lot_like_the_first_part_of/,2023-02-28 03:55:35,Taylor Swift,0.24924077

"I don't know if anyone has already done this but Sydney N4 (26th Feb.) will be the first night Taylor will have to repeat surprise song, if she doesn't do it before.

Here is math if anyone is interested,

TS: 13

Fearless: 26 (With ITWAM)

Speak Now: 22 (I'm counting vault tracks, without ITWAM)

Red: 29 (Without ATW 5 min version)

Lover: 18

Folklore: 17 (also I'm not sure if I should count Invisible Strings) 

Evermore: 17

Midnights: 21 (The Till Dawn Edition, without SOTB (feat. More LDR) and Karma (feat. Ice Spice))

I was inspired by the fantastic data analysis that u/MeatThatTalks did on lyrical density, so I put together some analysis on which Taylor songs use really uncommon words.

Some notes: I disregarded any super common words, so things like ""the"", ""and"", or ""I"" didn't contribute to a song's average. I also cut out any words that were just sounds like ""mmm"" or ""ooh"" because they were skewing things. Finally, the lyric database I used unfortunately didn't have any of the Taylor's Version albums : (",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/15if6pc/how_common_are_the_words_taylor_uses_oc/,How common are the words Taylor uses?

"Hi Swifties. Out of 114 votes, 85 of you are tired of the same songs winning and losing over and over again. This poll will function to determine how it is handled with the following options:

* **Hall of Fame and Infamy (required):** Members submit and vote on songs being added to list. Songs on both lists cannot be used in voting for or against games excluding: initial TV album reactions/Rev’s follow up game. This list will reset at the beginning of each year to allow members to remove a song entirely. Mods will automatically re-run polls at the beginning of the year to confirm if the songs stay on the list or not. If a song stays 3 years in a row, it becomes a permanent fixture.
* **Hame of Fame and Infamy (optional):** Same as above (minus the reset) except the list functions for game runners to know what songs the sub’s tired of and it’s primarily optional. The only time it’s non-optional is if the game runner has never dropped songs and has run at least 10 games. In this case their 11th game it is required and then goes back to optional.
* **Do nothing** and hope the conversation results in some people using songs known to lose or win often less

We do want to mention that regardless of the results, mods will participate in pulling songs every so often. That being said, the long-term goal for this sub is for members to run more games (including one-offs) and mods to run less games. This is so we can focus more on helping game runners in anyway desired which includes assisting in running their games when needed and/or running games submitted by members who then disappeared.

On a final note, we did receive a third idea on how to handle but could not establish a means of making it work that didn’t require game runners to always have to run an extra game.

"Hello, I need a bit of advice on whether this is a fair trade regarding the value of merch. On today’s episode of I’m desperate for a Cardigan that won’t cost an arm and leg—I’m considering trading an extra ticket (front row of a lower-bowl section) in exchange for a cardigan. The cost of the ticket was definitely more than what Cardigans were originally listed for, but I understand they have more value now as they’re difficult to obtain. It was a birthday present for my best friend, but she can no longer go and I’m not sure how to sell the ticket on one of those websites because I don’t think transfers are allowed for the European shows. (I also don’t want to risk scalpers buying and relisting it for above face value). So I posted in one of the merch groups saying I’d love to trade the ticket for a folklore cardigan {nothing extra required in addition to the cardigan}. I also thought it’d be a fun way to get a swifite friend so I didn’t have to go to the concert alone. One girl messaged me saying she’d love to make the trade, but wants 200$ cash in addition to the cardigan. That’s more than half the price of the ticket, so I’m not sure if that’s a fair trade. I’m not sure. Should I be offering cash along side the ticket?",https://i.redd.it/2r77hzs55pib1.jpg,Is trading a ticket for a Cardigan a fair trade?,TaylorSwiftMerch,t3_15ts7ys,/r/TaylorSwiftMerch/comments/15ts7ys/is_trading_a_ticket_for_a_cardigan_a_fair_trade/,2023-08-17 16:22:54,Taylor Swift,0.045378547
"These songs can either be two (or more?) songs from TS, or a TS song that sounds like a song(s) from another artist.

Examples:

New Romantics (Taylor Swift) - It Kills Me (Lil Pitchy)

I think they're alike lyrically as in New Romantics it says ""Come on, come along with me"" and in It Kills Me ""Breaking a, breaking a heart is too easy. Doing this, doing this to you, it kills me."" If you listen to both they have the same fast paced way of saying it and they just remind me of each other.

Mastermind (Taylor Swift) - Suburban Legends (Taylor Swift)

I think they're both alike melodically, plus ""Tick-tock on the clock"" in Suburban Legends just goes with the thing in Mastermind with time and clocks.

Now That We Don't Talk (Taylor Swift) - Thank U, Next (Ariana Grande)

I have no clue why I think they're alike, I haven't even listened to Thank U, Next fully, I just thought of it when I first listened NTWDT.

Edit: I was listening to evermore and up came coney island.

"Might be Unpopular,but Eras Tour VIP Box is pretty Underwhelming.Especially compared to Rep VIP BoX.

I was checking YouTube shorts and hey am I the only one who think Eras Tour box is pretty lame. It doesn't have any oomph factor, especially after remembering the spectacular Rep VIP Box. I still remember being blown away by that. That little screen, the stage miniature, that magazine(if I remember the mag was available in target also,but still),the ticket enclosed in a glass/plastic frame.... the box screamed exclusive, which was Reps theme.After Rep my fav is 1989 box, if I remember it had sunglasses, a Tumbler etc, which would come handy even after tour,so money well spent anyway you look at it. 

It is kinda stupid of me to write this, since as a South Indian I don't think I'll have a chance to open any VIP Box, even in the oddest chance she came to India, it would definitely be Mumbai or Delhi, no chance for us.

It wouldn’t be worth it for her. To be honest, I view Taylor as a good, but morally complicated person.

"I've been blown away by the reception of ""Labyrinth"" since Midnights' release.

As a 35 year-old man and a relatively newer Swiftie (was a passive fan before I met her in 2019), Midnights was another album listened to at launch. And I liked it, enjoyed it, so-on and so forth as it played, until ""Labyrinth"": then I was awestruck.

There's something about it that just takes me back to being in high school, to every relationship being *the* one. The breathiness of the verse reminds me of late night whispers to my girlfriend (now wife) at 1am on our parents' cell phones (Mobile-to-Mobile was free after 10!) . The repeated chorus recalls how sing-song and dreamy it all felt.

I was introduced to the anime Toradora! during COVID and it had the same effect on me. How I missed the days when your relationship was so important, when your biggest joy was seeing your boyfriend/girlfriend between class.

Which leads to the outtro.

God, I love the outtro so much. It weirdly reminds me of Bo Burnham's Kanye rant piece, with the ethereal motion acting almost like light cues, bouncing around for Taylor's voice to get lost in it. Except, instead of a rant, it's the words ""Uh oh, I've fallen in love"" over and over again. Shocked. The soundscape swirls and dazzles like a world in motion, but her words are the same.

Like when you were young, and you were surprised by your emotions, by the intensity of your feelings, by how confusing and surprising and exciting and scary it all felt. And then it builds and builds and builds until it just sort of ends.

To me in FEARLESS 
You belong with me
The other side of the door
We were happy 

The ybwm and the wwh guys grew together and created a bond which turned into romantic feeling from the ybwm guy, but he never said anything since he was afraid, time passed by and the wwh guy met the tosotd girl and they fell in love, he started to drift away from the ybwm guy and he didn't take this well. The lyrics of ybwm echoed through his mind everytime he saw him, he had been with him for as long as he could remember, but he couldn't bring himself to tell him anything. The ybwm guy had divorced parents and decided to go live with his father on the next town over, choosing to confess his love in the last day of school,  the wwh guy didn't know what to say, but he decided to spend some time apart with the tosotd girl. She was heartbroken and the events of the song happened so he ultimately decided to stay with her and respectfully reject his best friend. He moved away and they never crossed paths again, 20 years passed by and the tosotd girl and what boy got married and had a family. During this time he realized that he had loved his friend and that he really wasn't happy with his current life, we were happy is him looking back in time with regret and guilt to those moments he spent with the ybwm guy.

My bf is a big TSwift fan and I’m trying to get my hands on a copy of the Fearless TV vinyl. I don’t think he’ll like the Target exclusive version, so I’m trying to find the standard gold variant. Any suggestions on where I should look? His birthday is mid-November so I’m cutting it a bit close. 😬

"I was just watching a few live performances of songs from the Lover album and was thinking what Lover Fest could've been! Lol.
I still remember the time when were literally MILKING the interviews she did during the ""4.26"" era for ANNNY kind of clues on 'TS7' (*literal shivers*), and in one of those interviews, probably for the ""ME!"" video, I remember her saying that there are deeper easter eggs in the video that shall only be uncovered in the tour!
Plus the 360° stage! I wonder how that would've been implemented! Plus the remember someone pointing out that the ""tip"" of the heart shaped stage pointed towards Joe's hometown, or smtng like that haha

[Miiild spoiler for eras (??)]
Do y'all think that we might be getting the detailed set designs/ renderings, setlist or even rehearsal clips (if any) from the lover fest anytime in the future?
Or.... do you think that she's incorporated it into the Lover aet of Eras?

"I posted this over on [another sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop_uncensored/s/AcipQ1AAzh) but I'd like to hear thoughts from this sub too!

I was listening to music on the bus earlier when the thought suddenly came to me. Do they technically have any b-sides?

First things first: What is a B-side? Simple, it's a song on the project that isn't the Title Track, aka the song that's pushed the hardest. Teasers, MV, Music Show Promotions, End of Year stages, the whole shebang. Sometimes a b-side is picked out to be promoted alongside/after the Title Track due to track synergy/contrast, popularity, or a billion other reasons. It's a standard formula that the team at ADOR seem to fully be ignoring right now.

If you haven't noticed, NewJeans have a very unconventional way of releasing music. 

Attention, Hype Boy, and Cookie were all promoted as equals. Ditto and OMG are equals. ETA, Super Shy, and Cool With You ALL are equals.

Every song has a Music Video. EVERY. SINGLE. SONG.
(Almost) every song has choreography.
Every song gets promoted on music shows.
All have higher production quality than the average b-side and numerous performances spanning countries and End of Year shows. 

The whole ""Visual Album"" thing they got going on is really working to their advantage. You ask someone on the street to sing a NewJeans Title Track and you'll probably get any of the songs I mentioned before. Somehow, they're all so much more memorable this way.

Hurt is probably the closest thing they have to a ""true"" b-side, I think it's literally their only song without choreo (that's kind of wild now that I think about it), followed by Get Up (that song is only like 36 seconds long though), and New Jeans (Powerpuff collab song).

What do you guys think?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NewJeans/comments/17kau6o/do_newjeans_have_bsides/,Do NewJeans have b-sides?,NewJeans,t3_17kau6o,/r/NewJeans/comments/17kau6o/do_newjeans_have_bsides/,2023-10-31 02:34:39,New Jeans,0.11398677
"Sometimes I’m listening to a song and there will be a sentence or two that will just touch my soul on a really deep level. 

I’ll give two examples, but parts of “my tears ricochet” esp when she sings “and I can’t go anywhere just not home” or “I still talk to you when I’m screaming at the sky.” Just wow. The Disney special described this as perhaps the story of a divorced couple, and I couldn’t agree more. It reminds me of such deep pain. 

Folklore's ""seven"" has a part that says ""passed down like folk songs, our love lasts so long"" –– like just wow. A love that transcends time and is passed down from generation to generation - whether it be by stories or by our future generations learning from us.

"I'm curious with the success of Cruel Summer if we could see other ""Singles that didn't get the full attention they deserved"" and I think the best example of this is New Romantics.

If you're unfamiliar, this was the final single from 1989 and the 7th single from it released, and because she was seemingly moving on to new eras (and because the song is quite clearly a queer anthem) it didn't get pushed the way it could have.

There was a New Romantics reference on Eras tour IG the other day, not far from when Taylor was posting about Cruel Summer being number one. It makes me wonder if we may see her try to give New Romantics it's flowers as well.

In another episode, a character is wearing a 1989 shit, which took me a second to realize it.

It made me think of the artist's salons such as Gertrude Stein's that were notoriously queer spaces, plus famous lesbians like Sylvia Beach who fled to Paris to escape censors and homophobia, which could add to the theme of escaping society and living in a rose-tinted bubble (""no I didn't see the news because we were somewhere else""). And for the reach of the century... Colette and her partner Mathilde de Morny performed lesbian scenes in Paris cabaret which could add weight to the chair theory. Plus, (this is just a fun and interesting coincidence) they kissed on stage which evoked uproar from homophobes and they were forced to date in secret and stop living together for another five years, which sounds oddly familiar 🤣.

"folklore and evermore are very story based as we all know, so I was wondering if yall have ever created your own story / timeline with your own tracklist.

Here’s mine:

foevermore:

1. the 1 - opening the story with “it could’ve been fun, if you would’ve been the one”, the main character wonders what their story would’ve been had they been together all this time, whether its a good or bad relationship

2. willow - the beginning of the relationship is when the MC goes for the person she wants. “life was a willow and it bent right to your wind” they find their way with each other and start dating for years and years

3. the last great american dynasty - they bought a house together and became the IT couple of the coastal town they found.

4. gold rush - the MC starts to fade away from ths daydream “the coastal town we never found will never see a love as pure as it. Cuz it fades into the gray of my day old tea”, slowly slipping away from the fantasy they had but trying theit best to reach out for what they want to truly believe in

5. my tears ricochet - “And I can go anywhere I want, anywhere I want just not home”, they want to go back to their fantasy which is what they consider home, but just cant hold onto to the fantasy any longer even though she keeps trying

6. tolerate it - “now im begging for footnotes in the story of your life”, the MC is trying to write footnotes, references, or mentions that could remind them of their fantasy relationship

7. august - “august slipped away into a moment in time”, they finally realize its just been a fantasy this whole time and woke up from it because it has fully slipped away

8. champagne problems - in real life, they had to go thru an arranged marriage but decided to run from the alter and not continue on with their wedding

9. right where you left me (bonus) - the significant other of the main character felt abandoned and froze in time, never moving on from the alter “im right where you left me”

10. tis the damn season - goes back to their parent’s house after all this fiasco and reminisces of their life and what could’ve been “time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires now im missing your smile”, forever having a lingering feeling of this fantasy relationship they wish could’ve been real

"I know we as a community generally agree that Ready For It/State of Grace is the best opener (coming to an agreement on the best closer has yet to be agreed upon but that’s for another post lol) but when it comes to worst I’ve never heard of one clear answer, so this is mine. 

For the opener, I’ve heard people say Welcome to New York is the true worst. While I agree that it’s the worst song on the album, it’s not the worst opener, considering that it’s supposed to show Taylor in a new place and complimenting the new sound in 1989. I Forgot That You Existed literally was terrible muted production with the message of “yeah you weren’t a good person but idgaf anymore.” Like I don’t see how that is a message about love. It’s not even a self love song. I just don’t understand it, and I think Lover the song would have been the better choice for the opener. 

For the closer, I’ve heard people say Change is worse, and I kind of get that, but Change fits Fearless because the whole thing of wanting change is fearless, but with midnights, mastermind only wraps up only one of the five things that kept her up at night. Dear Reader is the elite closer, not only because it’s a reflective ending and a self aware moment, but also the production and lyrics feel exclusively for Midnights, unlike the majority of the other songs on Midnights sound like they’re a reject of one of her other albums. 

In comparison to her other albums, this is just my take on it. Like compared to all of her other album openers and closers, there’s no other album closer and opener as unfulfilling as these two. And before anyone gets upset: worst ≠ bad. While I’m indifferent to IFTYE and I feel like there could have been a bit more effort put into Mastermind, I don’t think they’re god awful, just disappointing.

——————————————————————————————

Edit: seems like I need to make one thing more clear: 

ahem, **WORST ≠ BAD**

I don’t hate or even dislike any of these songs. There are actual songs in Taylor’s discography that are bad skips and these aren’t any on them.

Also, side note: a lot of y’all just keep saying that my opinion is wrong and I know yall are just protecting your fav songs, but damn, it’s an opinion. Who hurt y’all so bad lmfao?

"This summer I finally got around to watching the Reputation tour on Netflix. I've been a fan of Taylor's music since debut, but was never really a big ""music person"" and didn't even consider going to concerts when I was young. As I grew up, I started to attend smaller, local concerts that my friends were going to, and I always had a fun time. Fast forward to the Eras announcement and I'm lucky enough to secure a ticket with my sisters, for my actual birthday! The concert was a dream, and easily the best of my life. I knew I had to watch the other tours I'd missed. 

So I started watching the Rep tour, and it was amazing. It gave me a deeper appreciation for the album (which I already really enjoyed). But as soon as I saw the Green Reputation jacket that she wears during DWOHT I fell in love. I knew I wanted to own it if I could!

So I searched online and saw that there were some dupes for sale on etsy, but they were really expensive and generally were made out of existing sequin blazers, to get the green sparkle look.  They looked nice enough, but one of the things that I really loved about Taylor's actual jacket was that it was more military leather style base, but still sparkly! That juxtaposition of tough and feminine that is a part of Reputation. So I decided I'd have to make my own!

I found a deep emerald military jacket as the base and went from there. I got green velvet sequin fabric and gold trim and hand sewed the collar, cuffs, pockets, shoulders. I found the patches for sale, including the snake on the back and used super strong fabric glue to attach. I bejeweled some of the patches to make them more fun and added eras colors to the crown, key, and swiftie patches. I found an assortment of pins to complete the look, including the cat on top of the teacup. Finally, I bejeweled the whole coat so it would still sparkle! I'm immensely proud of my hard work and did the best I could to duplicate everything!

Where did I wear such a beauty if I'd already been to the Eras tour? I wore it to two showings of the concert movie, including opening night Friday. I also wore it to a Taylor Swift dance party. And a few times around one of the largest horse shows in the world because western horse people appreciate bedazzled outfits, haha.  It wouldn't have worked well at my actual concert because it was way too hot.  I wore a dupe of Taylor's concert ""The Lucky One"" outfit, which was also fun to make (I didn't bejewel my shorts because I wanted to re-wear them, but did put red crystals all over the bow belt).",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/18as03x,Green Reputation Jacket Duplicate + bonus,TaylorSwift,t3_18as03x,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/18as03x/green_reputation_jacket_duplicate_bonus/,2023-12-04 19:27:36,Taylor Swift,0.049089402

"I love Taylor so much. I’ve been a massive fan for 15 years. Seeing the Eras show this year was one of the most fun nights of my life, especially being with so many people who love her music as much as I do. I’m proud of her.

But I, along with millions of young people, have spent the last two months watching a genocide on my phone. I wake up every day hoping that young journalists, like Motaz or Hind or Bisan are still alive. They have risked their lives and completely disrupted mainstream media, exposing so much that was misrepresented on TV by our elders. They brought millions of people into the streets to protest. The reason so many young people, especially young Jewish people, have broken from their elders is because they had the opportunity to see the truth with their own eyes. Over 60% of Gaza’s housing units are damaged or destroyed. I see it in the photos. 1000 children have been amputated. I have seen them. 77 journalists have died. We watch them mourn their colleagues. 1.9 million people are displaced, and surviving on pieces of bread. We have watched them walk under gunfire. And we have seen the more than 15,000 dead, every day for two months. 

During the eras tour in the US, I’d wake up in the morning and look up what the special song was and text my friends. Today I wake up checking if Motaz and Bisan are still alive and I  call my senators. These young people are my heroes and they are the people who have made the greater impact on me this year and forever. Bisan is 25. Plestia is 22. Motaz is 24. Hind is 28.

So I feel as if the photoshoot, the nomination, all of it, no longer fits the moment so many of us young people are living in. I love Taylor, but I’m praying for peace over any new album or concert tickets this year. I wish the Time cover had represented that. I wish Taylor would use her platform for that.

" With the start of the Eras Tour and Taylor being LOUDD on tour, I have Unboxed some of my thoughts about her possibly coming out and/or Karma (Taylor’s Version) being released after tour.  


Firstly, I loved the big surprise opening being MA&amp;THBP, I was certainly not expecting that. But, I think “it’s been a long time coming” as an opening line was Sweet!  


With all of the discourse around opening weekend and the undeniable Flags she was sending, I wanted to try to piece some of the puzzle together, figured it was Worth the Shot.  


Disclaimer- I know many people don’t believe she will explicitly come out and she obviously does not owe an explanation to anyone, but personally I think she does really want to be open and honest, and has been wanting to/ planning her escape from the glass closet for years.  


1- Eras feeling like a finale in a sense-  


\- Everyone has been talking about how this feels like an ending of some sort. Of course the hetlors all believe it means that she will be taking a break to get married and have kids because they missed the Lavender Haze line apparently. In our Gaylor perspective I think it wraps up nicely as a celebration of all of her previous eras, even if she was forced to closet and partake in PR relationships.  
\- I think she has made it clear that she’s in a headspace right now where she just loves creating so I certainly don’t see this as being some kind of retirement from all creative projects. But, this wrap up could be the perfect lead in to a completely rebranded version of herself. Beautifully pulling all of her eras together to leave them behind and come out to live authentically, and hoping her fans will follow into this new era, all while simultaneously wrapping up as a goodbye to the fans that don’t continue to support her. With how large this tour is, and her predictably becoming a billionaire, it also pads her pockets to counteract the possibility of her losing sales in the future, and ensure her entire team remains employed.  


2- Burning down the lover house-  


\- This brings us to the symbolism of burning down the lover house. And just in case you missed it the first time, she burns the house down twice. She is lighting her past on fire to burn down how she had previously represented herself when she was forced to stay in the closet. I think her burning it twice represents the previous times she has tried to come out (once with Karma as TS6 but was scrapped by her label, second time in the Lover era but foiled by the masters heist). (“I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere”)  
\- BUT, I still find it interesting how we can see into the entire house except for behind the door. So there is still a part of this Lover House we have yet to see, what could that be? Personally, I think this represents the Karma album/era that we did not get to experience with her, it happened ‘behind closed doors’. This leads us to the tour production for Karma, the screen has a door floating down behind her, because Karma is still hidden behind the closed door. Once the door reaches the bottom is turns into a bright ball of light, ultimately leading to rainbow colouring.  


3- Karma finale on tour-  


\- This brings us to the Karma finale. I would think that if Taylor was going to take a break, she would end the concert with Long Live even if we do not have Taylor’s Version yet. Instead she opts to close out the Eras Tour with Karma. Yes, I’ll repeat “close the eras tour with Karma”. Not just on a nightly basis, but I think she will close out the eras tour by releasing Karma. I already still believed that her 11th album would be Karma, even after her announcing it is a song “instead”. I mean after all, Karma was written twice on The Man Wall.  


4- Karma TS11 proof-  


\- Aside from The Man Wall, the most obvious proof would be that Karma is track 11 on Midnights. Also, she sings “Karma is a cat” - Then, in the Anti-Hero MV in the funeral scene, her portrait shows her with 11 cats, one for each album 1-10 +one cat is Karma. On tour she also made it clear she views her albums as kids with the way she mentioned that there were new additions to the family, being Lover - Midnights albums. Then, at the end of the Anti-Hero MV we see the two Taylor’s on the roof (which I believe is the two versions we see in her music, one who values her reputation so wishes to “hide in plain sight” and the other who values love and wishes to live authentic to herself and her love), but then we see the giant Taylor walk up to them wearing… the same shirt that she wore when she announced Karma as track 11 in MMWM. I think this Taylor is giant because of the huge reaction that a coming out album would receive, she is the biggest superstar in the world and this would be a huge album drawing a ton of attention, thus the giant-ness of her portrayal.  
\- Bringing this back to the lover house, the long skinny ORANGE windows on each side of the door literally look like a big 11, meaning album 11 will allow for us to see behind the door.  
\- We know the famous line of this Midnights era is “meet me at midnight”, and on The Man Wall, Karma is at the 12:00 position if viewed as a clock “it’s a clock, she’s a clock”, so maybe that’s the midnight where we truly meet her. Possibly after all the remaining re-recordings, or possibly like Midnight’s as a pit stop between them.  
\- Back to tour though (I know I’m all over the place) the LWYMMD production sees ALL of her previous eras in glass closets, not only the stolen ones, so it’s not directed at the stolen masters. I see this as her saying that all of these eras have been glass closeting, but as she says “why? Because she’s dead” they all get released from their glass closet. So, when she burns the Lover house down and comes out, she will have “killed off” the old Taylor and be reborn into a new era where there won’t be any need for this glass closeting any more. But, I also thinks it’s worth noting the transition from Don’t Blame Me to LWYMMD, I think “don’t blame me for what you made me do” is very much directed at the people who forced her into the closet. But there are many other visuals that depict her hiding in closets in the production as well though, like in Lavender Haze.  


5- Karma release-  


\- Now just for fun let’s speculate a possible release date for Karma. Being that Taylor likes to leave big Easter eggs right in front of us, and Karma always seems to come back to the number 11, I thought it could be possible she releases it on an 11th. She announced Karma and gave us her little giggle in episode 8 of MMWM. So I checked, and Aug 11th IS A FRIDAY. Not only that, it is the very first Friday after the US leg of tour is completed.  
\- Although realistically she would not likely come out after the US shows and then move on to International, who really knows we haven’t gotten international dates yet anyways so might as well clown for now haha but the dates lined up too well for me not to include.  
\- PS Taylor please give International dates soon I do not want to MISS THIS.  


With all of this in mind, this could possibly be the last full international tour she ever does. With how big this tour is, the production, the duration, everything, it could be her final tour. Her coming out would result in her shows being possible targets for homophobic attacks so in the interest of her fans safety I could see her keeping to smaller shows and performances rather than a huge tour going forward in the future.  
But then again she continues to top herself and has highlighted that she is Uncontrollable, so who knows.  


Personally, I think (hope) we will receive Karma (pop-rock) and that album will be undeniably gay and she will finally be free from her glass closeting and PR relationships. Whatever happens, I am extremely excited to see!

"Hi everyone! I've been working to create a spreadsheet with a masterlist of every merch release Taylor has ever done (for those of us crazy completionists who like to know what we want to collect). 

I already have a complete & comprehensive checklist of records, based on the Ultimate Taylor Swift Vinyl Guide made by love.potion.vinyl on Instagram. 

I'm hoping to crowdsource information regarding merch that was available at previous tours, on her website previously, etc., specifically anything that isn't music (ie. vinyl, CDs, or cassettes, since I can find those on Discogs). If you know of any merch drops or have any merch that you can describe/send pics of, that'd be super helpful! Thanks in advance, fellow Swifties 🩷

"So, let me start off by saying: I thought Midnights was a breakup album the very first time I heard it. It’s painfully obvious. There were too few songs that could’ve been tied to her other eras, too many references to Joe. Honestly, I’ve been convinced they weren’t endgame since folklore+evermore. 

Because of this, her recent messiness makes a lot of sense to me. Here’s why. 

Prior to f+e, Red was by far her most mature album, both lyrically and tonally. You can tell how much that relationship had wrecked her, but she’d had the time and space from it afterward to make an incredible album. 

Cue a lot of surprise (for me, anyway) when her next album was 1989. Lots of songs about how she’s supposedly crazy, or being snarky about something…but it really didn’t have any teeth to it when it came to really making a statement about who she was. It seemed very much like a girl trying to bounce back from a relationship that was all-consuming, but she was struggling to figure out what was left. The era was consequently messy AF, with the girl gang drama and “I’d like to be excluded from this narrative” Taylor. 

That album was still one of her biggest, though. Longtime naysayers of hers I knew were spinning 1989 and calling it one of the best of the year. I think this really fueled her messiness, because she basically insulated herself from any criticism (deserved or not) with her stage/famous persona.

Of course, Kimye, Calvin/Tom, and all the other drama then gave us Reputation. She’s already seriously with Joe at this point, and we see that reflected in how much more grounded the music becomes. Yes, she’s still singing about being misunderstood and getting back at people who wronged her…but she’s doing so in a way that feels like it’s coming from a much more secure place.

Then Lover. An underappreciated album, IMO. Peak happiness with Joe, but we start to see little signs of her insecurities and fears. 

Cue the pandemic, and we get folklore+evermore. These are deep and raw and everything we wanted from music at the time. She claims there are lots of other stories in here for once, and in some cases that’s true, but in a lot of ways, it’s not. There are clues all over about the struggles she’s having with Joe, and working with Aaron Dessner brings out that pain in the best, most cathartic way. They’re clearly going around and around in their relationship, and she’s begging him — BEGGING him — to just please give her what she needs. 

I think lockdown forced her to stop for the first time in several years and realize what her life could look like in a real, serious relationship. Not what she thought it should be like, but what it could actually be. And I think that’s where she really built up the pain with Joe. She’d gotten her closest experience yet with safety and security in love, but he wasn’t in the same place. 

So, folklore and evermore are the grownup Red. Which means…yep. Midnights is 1989, 2.0.

It’s got a lot of the same snark as 1989 and still lacks the teeth of Reputation, but there’s the same sense of not knowing herself anymore — an almost existential crisis as you see her internal battle, in my opinion, between desperately needing and wanting the love and validation from her fans, and really wishing she could have the more stable, contained life she had with Joe when she hid from the media and during lockdown. She’s telling us to stop putting her on a pedestal, but then still maximizes her stage presence and her million album variants like someone who doesn’t know how to not be on top. And she’s using the intense fandom to distract her from any potential consequences. I think she’s having an identity crisis, and that’s why she’s clinging to a guy she’s known forever. In a weird way, it’s grounding for her because it’s a touch point back to her pre-Joe self. 

Anyway, my reasoning for all of this is because I ended a marriage for a lot of the same reasons that you hear in folklore, evermore, and YLM. It’s not that they’re a bad person. It’s not that you’re being unreasonable. But sometimes what you need isn’t something the other person is capable of giving you. And I can tell you how UNBELIEVABLY hard it is to accept that and make the decision to leave. It tears you down to your very core and it’s excruciating having to put yourself back together. And yes, sometimes you take a very circuitous (and stupid) route to get there. So I think she’s in a very 1989-like headspace, she’ll eventually get brought back down to earth, and real Taylor will re-emerge. 

TL,DR; she’s not losing it, she’s heartbroken and doesn’t have the time or ability to process it right now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/13u02mv/midnights_era_messiness_analysis/,Midnights Era Messiness Analysis,TaylorSwift,t3_13u02mv,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/13u02mv/midnights_era_messiness_analysis/,2023-05-28 13:08:08,Taylor Swift,0.1587729

I've been trying to avoid videos to not spoil the concert, and I've got a ticket pretty much in line with the back stage (with the big screen) - I'm kind of worried that all I'll see is her back, so I was wondering... 
Does she turn around during the songs? I guess sometimes she has to walk back, but does she sing to the people ""behind"" the stage even for a couple of minutes? What's everyone's experience? Thank you!!
