"When folklore came out I imagined a musical with the Betty/James/Augustine love triangle.

Not sure I can remember it all but it starts out with Betty getting an invitation to James and Augustine's wedding which she at first takes in her stride (the 1) because that's all water under the bridge, right? That was 20 years ago. It was high school.

The story itself is told during the wedding weekend and in flashbacks to their teenage years.

At the rehearsal dinner, James learns through gossip about the life that Betty has been living (The Last Great American Dynasty).

She's been married, she lives an impressive life, she thought she'd moved on, but when she sees James again, she realises what she's been missing. In a moment alone they reminisce (Cardigan). To Betty it's a declaration of love. To James it's closure.

Betty unravels. The night before the wedding, she begs James to choose her. He tries to walk away. She gets angry (My Tears Ricochet).

The wedding goes ahead. James and Augustine get married.  During their first dance, Betty tries to outshine and get James's attention (Mirrorball). James only has eyes for Augustine. Betty gets more and more desperate until she's standing on the balcony railing. With the last line she falls and the stage goes black.

When the lights come up, Betty is standing on a porch, the distant sounds of a party in the background, and James enters with an acoustic guitar (Betty). At the end of the song, they kiss. To Betty, it's her happy ending. In reality, it's her dying thoughts.

There's other stuff, the full story of that summer in high school. Augustine sings August. Betty ""wins"" and keeps James until graduation but they drift apart in college. A few years later, James and Augustine's paths cross and it slowly becomes something that grows through the years until we're at that wedding weekend (Invisible String).

"Ahh, I was definitely thinking about all the discourse surrounding the AMAs Artist of the Decade! Thanks for the reminder.

I am also a bit surprised she hasn‚Äôt dropped Speak Now yet. That seems like a home run and highly anticipated re-release. Curious to see how the rollout goes, especially if it happened before the tour begins. She put a lot of promo time in for her past re-releases, and I imagine she might be hunkered down now with rehearsals, family time, etc before hitting the road. Who knows?

"She was clearly wealthy. The hummer cat. The houses. If you think thats not rich you should come here to the thirld world and compare lifestyles..........Still, you can be rich and be a flop musically wise. She fought hard for her dream and had the talent to back it up. The charisma too. The nerve. The braveness. The grit to continue pursuing her dreams above all. 

Her parents helping her was one of the best things ever. All the popgirls with the most healthy stable lifes come from good families. In the opposite we have people like Justin Bieber-Britney with abusive or bad parents.  Is a great thing to have the backup of a loving family. Thats how things always should be. Why to feel ashamed of that?

Im a Shakira fan and the reason why she never turned chaotic with all the huge fame-riches and coming from a tiny town is cause her parents were always vigilant about her. Always riding with her and supportive and communicative. Always guiding her even if she had to endure lots of bad situations. That was a key.  

Taylor without good parents or parents as explotative as the britney-lindsay lohan ones = disaster. Specially cause she had too many bad situations when she was young and hate and scandals.",TaylorSwift,t3_15zzftc,2023-08-24 19:01:19,Taylor Swift,

"This is the pattern I used as the base for my pattern: [CROCHET PATCHWORK CARDIGAN FREE PATTERN + TUTORIAL](https://makeanddocrew.com/patchwork-crochet-cardigan-free-pattern/). Instead of working in strips using ehdc like she did, I made each square individually so I could block them. 

I used [these](https://www.braceletbook.com/users/312520_crazy-life/) pixel art graphics for the albums (HUGE shoutout to that creator!) and did a sc border around each of them. Because most of them had multiple color changes in the first row and I didn‚Äôt want to deal with that in a foundation chain, instead I did a foundation sc row with the border color and counted that as ‚Äúrow 0‚Äù. Then for the actual border I attached at the bottom right corner and did the other 3 sides so the foundation row blended right in. For the other designs, I drew them out on graph paper. BraceletBook is also a great resource to look for other designs too! I found an ivy one on there that I really wanted to use but just didn‚Äôt have time.

I blocked the squares to 6.5 x 6.5 inches and I would say the cardigan turned out to be about a size L/XL. I followed the pattern pretty exactly for the sleeves except without changing colors because again, not enough time. I did shorten by a few rows because I have short arms. I mattress stitched everything together.

For the border I wanted to do the ribbing in the pattern but once again, ran out of time (it was like an hour before I had to leave lol). Instead I just did one row of dc around the cardigan and the cuffs with the border color and called it good.

Pretty much all of the yarn I used was red heart super saver or big twist (or random skeins I found without a label). It‚Äôs a little scratchy but it should soften after washing, just make sure you weave your ends securely if you‚Äôre going to wash it! I always do 3 passes back and forth under the same stitches to make sure it‚Äôs secure.

Hopefully this was clear! Feel free to ask any questions :)

"She has won 3 AOTY.  But she has the lowest winning percentage compared to Bey, Adele, Gaga, or Billie.  Has fewer Grammys than either of them (except Billie).  Has a 20% winning percentage in general categories, compared to Adele 77% winning percentage in general categories.  Paul Simon has 3 AOTY wins with a higher winning percentage, nearly 50% winning percentage.  I don‚Äôt see anyone referring to him as a Grammy darling.  My point is she may have won 3 AOTY but her winning percentage is so low in all categories and in general categories compared to the other female artists that is seems to me like a misleading statement.  Especially when mentioned in the same context with Adele who has a 67% winning percentage in SOTY and 78% winning percentage in general categories. And has nearly double the general category wins than Taylor does.

"I haven‚Äôt seen my three favorite lines here yet so:

**I knew you, heartbeat on the highline, once in twenty lifetimes** 

I love this line because it‚Äôs explaining that this is the kind of love and connection you could live multiple lives and never find. (Also I have a whole theory about how this connects to the willow MV and ivy but ill leave that for some other time) 

**I knew you, tried to change the ending, Peter losing Wendy** 

This kills me because it holds so many layers of meaning: growing up, maturity, fate, yet another concept of being star-crossed, (and also I connect it to the *chasing shadows in the grocery line* lyric, because I imagine a grown up Wendy, doing mundane normal adult things like grocery shopping and seeing a shadow and imagining for a second it‚Äôs Peter‚Äôs shadow and he‚Äôs come back to her and then realizing it‚Äôs just a regular shadow- and then the narrator positioning herself as Wendy, who ‚Äúknew everything when she was young‚Äù contrasted with James who ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt know anything‚Äù makes it a heartbreaking metaphor) 

And finally my favorite is 

**you can aim for my heart, go for blood, but you would still miss me in your bones** 

Because the dual meaning of almost every clause in the line. Like ‚Äúyou can aim at what I care about most to hurt me to take me down and ruin me but you will miss/won‚Äôt succeed‚Äù AND ‚Äúyou can physically aim a gun at my heart and shoot to kill me, and even if you succeed you will miss me forever and it will haunt you.‚Äù


‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

Honorable mention to the brilliance of:

*you‚Äôre a flashback, in a film scene, on the one screen in my town

showing just how much (metaphorical) distance and separation there is between the singer and the person they‚Äôre singing about -they‚Äôre like 3 times removed 1.They‚Äôre a flashback  2. A flashback in a film 3. On a film screen AND just how much the person they‚Äôre singing to means to them - they‚Äôre in the only film on the the only screen in their metaphorical town, memories of them is all the person can think of. 

as well as 

*is it romantic how all my elegies eulogize me* 

When you think of the three meanings of romantic 

1. that she‚Äôs making a reference to the romantic poets *lakes where all the poets went to die* and romanticism was: ‚Äúa poetic movement that turned toward nature and the interior world of feeling, in opposition to the mannered formalism and disciplined scientific inquiry of the Enlightenment era that preceded it.‚Äù  
2. Romantic also means something that creates an idealized view of reality   
3. Romance and love have been a large theme of her work. 

-elegies are poems or songs of contemplation, usually meant as a tribute to the dead, and Taylor‚Äôs songs are largely about the past and past relationships that she sees as ‚Äúdead and gone and buried‚Äù (atw10mv) and past versions of herself.   

-eulogize means to praise, honor, glorify, eulogies are also commonly given at funerals but also can be written for living people- and Taylor is saying her songs about her past relationships and past selves eulogize her, or praise and glorify her, which connects back to the 2nd meaning of romantic which is ‚Äúan idealized view of reality‚Äù 

There‚Äôs layers and layer and layers in that line and then when she follows it up with the lines about cell phones and tweets she‚Äôs literally creating modern day romantic poetry juxtaposing the world of nature and emotion and feelings against modernity and science and technology.  

Really I look forward to the day when people seriously study the layers of meaning in her writing",TaylorSwift,t3_zt6nsx,2023-01-07 02:34:05,Taylor Swift,

So she has to consistently ""stay fresh"" (think ""Nothing New"") and therefore keep people fixed on her in a good way.

"august - I was in a love triangle in high school and I was august in the situation. It was always him switching off between myself & another girl, and one summer they got into a fight (unbeknownst to me) & he came running back to me. We were together for most of that summer, and truth be told, it was magic - the best time we'd ever had together in the 3 years we were off-and-on. Then out of the blue, late August right before the first day of senior year, he went running back to his betty. I guess in the back of my mind I always knew he would. ""Cancel plans just in case you call"" was my motto. I wish I had this specific song back then (2007-2010) because my little teenaged heart was shattered. ""I remember thinkin I had you"" would have hit so hard because up until the moment I realized he'd gone back to betty (via a Facebook selfie they took at a downtown concert he told me he'd take me to, then ghosted) I was convinced we were going to stay together for good; same with ""so much for summer love and saying 'us' cause you weren't mine to lose."" His first words ever to me were at a football game freshman year, when he walked right up to me and said ""who made you cry on your guitar?"" because of Teardrops lyrics on my AIM away message; I didn't even know who he was but he knew me. We didn't communicate at all senior year, but he reached out to me every time I came home from college for the first 3 years even though he's been with his betty ever since he broke up with me that last time and I cringe at the thought of him now because yikes LOL but high school me was so in love with him. No worries - I married my Lover last summer ü•∞

"The email was BEYOND unhinged lmao Not what I expected from a guy who hands out guitar picks at concerts but then again, it feels her whole family was super invested in her career to begin with.

Which was a good and a bad thing. Good because she was so protected. Bad because I think it didn't help her parent's marriage and probably added to her already existing issues with relationships.

That said, the whole lawsuit feels very he said she said tbh. Similar to that guy who swears he was her guitar teacher when in fact, he was not.

Also, OP posts on Swiftie neutral that is anything but neutral. They should embrace their brethren over at Fauxmoi.

That said, she really doesn't seem that interested in men anymore ... which, I'm ngl, that lines up with the experiences of a lot of the older queer women I've known, including myself.

"So you‚Äôre one of THOSE. Don‚Äôt bring race into this bc it has nothing to do with it, besides painting yourself as racist and incredibly ignorant.

Taylor has done more good for more people of all races and backgrounds than 99.99% of people, and I‚Äôm betting to say yourself included. She treats everyone well and donates so much $$ yet people like you call her ‚Äúprivileged white woman‚Äù and get mad when she has the audacity to rightly defend herself when she‚Äôs attacked and essentially called a wh*** on tv. How would you feel if someone did that to you? Or bc she‚Äôs a ‚Äúprivileged white woman‚Äù she‚Äôs not allowed to have feelings or speak out?

As for Matty Healy, are you telling me you haven‚Äôt dated anyone questionable? Or friends/family who haven‚Äôt? If I couldn‚Äôt associate with anyone who didn‚Äôt make bad life choices at some point, I‚Äôd be living by myself in the middle of the woods.

"I mean she affective writes the beats/melody too. Hence why she can record very similar songs to the originals as taylor's versions. Crazier wasn't written FOR Disney, it was a debut era song that she ended up giving to them So she could release it. To be honest, the question shouldn't be ""can she release it?"" Because the answer is yes. She can. The only real question is ""Does she care that she doesn't technically own Crazier, since her main gripe with her masters being sold was who they were sold to?""

Tbh I feel like she will off popular demand if nothing else. I mean, she did talk extensively that it was important to her that artists have ownership of their own work, and now out of fear of what had already happened she may re-record Crazier just to get it back. Plus, people (it's me, I'm people), are DYING for it to be re-recorded. She only put ATW10 on Red TV because we wanted it. To be honest, I feel like Disney wouldn't even really mind, since Crazier doesn't really get views anymore, and releasing a TV will get people streaming the original again too. So, in my mind it's only a net benefit for her to record a TV, but I guess only time will tell",TaylorSwift,t3_16ypygg,2023-10-04 00:53:20,Taylor Swift,

"There‚Äôs actually a quite lot going on in Cardigan. The verse progression is relatively uncommon: ii V IV V it doesn‚Äôt hit the root until the chorus. It‚Äôs basically a subversion of the classic Jazz ii V I but in Cardigan it delays hitting home until the chorus to build tension then the release. If you‚Äôre teaching songwriting or harmony it‚Äôs a perfect example of how hitting the tonic feels like home and how delaying hitting it builds tension. 

The chorus is a simple classic 3 chord trick: I V IV V but the verse sets it up really well. The interlude before the ‚Äòkissing cars‚Ä¶‚Äô repeats the trick then you‚Äôve got essentially a triple chorus/bridge then the ‚Äòyou‚Äôll come back to me‚Äô switches back to the ii chord. The chorus lyrics never repeats although you‚Äôve got the old Cardigan refrain as the narrative scaffold.

Percussion wise it‚Äôs got both a strong straight 8th note beat but with a swung 16th note thing giving it a really swung feel.

It‚Äôs a pretty clever song, and Taylor‚Äôs melody really plays with I ii and V smartly and while it‚Äôs not showy or flashy production the way the instruments are layered and the sense of space in the song might make it one of her best produced tracks, and that before you get into how good the storytelling is",TaylorSwift,t3_10837ss,2023-02-12 03:49:46,Taylor Swift,

"IIRC, she said somewhere that she doesn't expect fans to give up listening to the originals. 

I continue to listen to the originals that I like better. For the most part, I prefer Taylor's Version, but there are some that I like better as the original so I keep listening to them. I'm listening to whichever version I prefer. I only listen on streaming, I don't own any CDs or Vinyls or Cassettes. 

Just listen to whichever version you prefer. It makes no difference to Taylor herself. Her tour & merch make her more money than streaming the originals makes Scooter, and I say that not as a motivator to buy her merch or go to the tour, I say that as a motivator to listen to whichever version you prefer!! I don't buy her merch (I find almost all of it ugly tbh) and I'm not going to the tour (tho I've been enjoying watching clips), but I still don't feel bad about streaming the originals. She's so wealthy, it's not like it matters. 

Also, the point of the rerecordings is so she can license it to movie and TV studios to use in their media. THAT is where the music itself makes money. IIRC, the owner of a song makes a fraction of a cent from streaming. And she does still make some from streaming of the originals, just not as much as from streaming of Taylor's Version.",TaylorSwift,t3_1519aja,2023-07-16 22:31:43,Taylor Swift,

"I didn't know it was slept on ;-; It might honestly be my favorite Taylor Swift song ever -- I feel like it was written about me and my best friend. We literally met and became best friends when we were seven years old, we grew up in the woods and were tough scrappy little tomboys who loved to daydream about running away together, and there were times when I had to hide in the closet because my dad had anger issues. It captures the beauty and horror of being a little girl so perfectly. And honestly it always felt very queer-coded to me (yes I'm projecting lol), like it gives me that feeling of freedom that you have when you're isolated from society and you don't have to worry about who or what you are, because everything is just repurposed stardust anyways, but there's this wistfulness too because once you've ""learned civility"" there's no going back, that fear and regret and self hatred is just a part of you now.

Also my ex girlfriend sent it to me when we first started dating and said ""this song made me think of you"" WAY before she knew anything about my childhood, and that still makes me emotional lol ;-;",TaylorSwift,t3_15hiy27,2023-08-04 14:24:32,Taylor Swift,

"Legal issues, or definition of stolen aside-  it‚Äôs absolutely a huge achievement and such an interesting project for an artist like Taylor to take on. 

Personally, I am in my early 40‚Äôs and was not a fan till Folklore and Evermore hooked me, now I do like a lot of older Taylor songs but to me she sounds so so young on the OG albums- the re-recordings are super close but there is a difference in her voice in her 30‚Äôs vs her teens and 20‚Äôs. So far I like the re-recordings more than the originals and can‚Äôt wait for Speak Now and Debut to be re-recorded. 

This is also genius for her long time fans who grew up with her, plus she‚Äôs giving so much extra content with vault tracks and alternate versions like All Too Well. 

For the younger swifties today- it‚Äôs a total role model move. It‚Äôs saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like how this deal turned out, I don‚Äôt like what you‚Äôre doing with the work I made. We could have reached an agreement but since I ultimately own these songs I can do THIS, and people will like it even more than what you have‚Äù 

It‚Äôs also genius because if I understand the deal correctly, Taylor has to agree for the original versions to be used in movies, TV, or commercials. She can now say no to the OG version, and yes to Taylor‚Äôs version. Love that for her.",TaylorSwift,t3_131l0ch,2023-06-25 16:18:13,Taylor Swift,

"This is true AND that doesn‚Äôt mean Joe was doing something ‚Äúwrong.‚Äù Who knows. Maybe he was. I‚Äôm not saying he was perfect. But I don‚Äôt like the instinct to glorify Taylor and vilify Joe on this sub (you didn‚Äôt do that, it‚Äôs just something I‚Äôve seen often). As someone with an anxious attachment style, extreme anxiety, specifically relationship anxiety, Lover was and is SO RELATABLE. Taylor has an anxious attachment style. That is clear early on in her work and it carries on in Lover and beyond (Peace and Labyrinth are two amazing examples). For people who don‚Äôt have this attachment style or issues, this may be harder to understand. It doesn‚Äôt have to come from a place of anything being wrong or your partner doing something wrong. It‚Äôs taking the smallest thing they said or did or sometimes literally imagining something and putting anxiety on it. It‚Äôs a constant fear that they will leave you, and oftentimes the pushback to that is, well I‚Äôll test them or I‚Äôll pick a fight or I‚Äôll leave first. I see that all over Taylor‚Äôs work. It‚Äôs up to that person to work on these issues that will show up in ANY of their relationships and for them to be honest with a good partner so their partner can work on how best to support them. I also agree with the very few folks who have pointed out that Taylor hasn‚Äôt had especially healthy relationships in the past and has even admitted in music that she like the more exciting relationships (the way I loved you). I think the beginning of her relationship with Joe was exciting (ie: cheating, sneaking around, the rush). Then I think for a bit she was happy with a simpler life (as a direct response to being roasted in the public eye and Joe seeing her as still a worthy partner and him being someone who appreciates the simple life). I think she stayed attached to what she felt for him in the beginning and convinced herself she wanted what he wanted (if you look back through her discography, you can see her change her personality traits and interests from partner to partner) but as time went on and she gained favor back in the public eye with folklore and evermore she realized she missed a lot of what she used to have and that caused and underlying tension between them. I think they both created that tension. The point is joes not wrong for wanting a simple life, and Taylor‚Äôs not wrong for wanting a magnificent one. They just stopped wanting the same thing at the same time.",TaylorSwift,t3_15ihjx7,2023-08-05 14:33:13,Taylor Swift,

"It really depends on your perspective :) I respect your opinion. 

For me, I was born in the age when cassettes are popular and I grew up listening to my parents' music via cassettes. Every time I play a tape, it brings me back to my childhood instantly. If you asked me which platforms I'd prefer, I'd say cassettes over Cds. Fun facts: as physically as CDs look, they are considered digitally music platform, not *analog* like vinyl records and cassettes. I wrote a paper on music platforms back in college ü•∞

Of course, CDs last a long time. Cassettes tend to deteriorate over time, and a frequently played cassette will start to sound worse faster. Not to mention the tape decks, it can be tough to find a good player. And they don't even last. Although I do know how to fix a deck if it goes bad, I sometimes frown upon the amount of times it happens.

With that being said, I promise if you give cassettes a try, they are surely worthy. You might enjoy it. So much :)",TaylorSwiftVinyl,t3_14v7ckj,2023-07-11 04:26:09,Taylor Swift,

"For me, it‚Äôs not so much that Lover isn‚Äôt a good album‚Ä¶ But it‚Äôs more that it follows Rep. 

Rep for me is the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm coming back, I‚Äôm taking what‚Äôs mine, rage and darkness‚Äù album. And I love it for that reason! 

But Lover follows right after Rep, and that transition is so‚Ä¶ Weird. You go straight from the dark, moody, rage-y, vengeful album of Rep to the lovey, sweet, sing-song, fantasy album of Lover‚Ä¶ You almost need a transition album between the two, that‚Äôs somewhere in the middle. 

Lover is good, and it‚Äôs slowly growing on me. But my problem is that it‚Äôs in SUCH contrast to Rep. 

I think Red was more consistent with the album preceding it. Yes, Speak Now is very country, but you get some pop elements. Red pulled more into the pop, but still has some country elements.

"It's only better if you can play it with the equipment you've got. Listening with wireless headphones? Can't listen to Hi-res lossless. Don't have a separate DAC and $1000+ wired headphones? Can't listen to Hi-res lossless. What res were the Master's recorded in? That's a limit as well. So, unless you've invested in special equipment to be able to listen to it in a silent room, it's probably just not worth the extra file size (or data usage to stream) - yet. For the musicians and streaming services, that also makes it not worth putting out the larger file formats since so few all be able to take advantage of them(making it not cost effective for them). That's why there is very little music released in hi-res lossless (so far). Of course, tech keeps evolving, so it may become more common. Unfortunately, our ears don't improve with age, so there will always be an inherent upper limit for all but the extreme audiophiles who will still probably want ""super-ultra-high-res lossless, only dogs can hear the upper registers"" when and if it became available. lol",TaylorSwift,t3_18m6x49,2023-12-19 20:32:32,Taylor Swift,

Red was the beginning of something unexpected. We have gotten so used to her country roots, it was unexpected to see her experimenting pop music at that time. The biggest surprise was 1989 cause it skyrocketed her career.

"Not to be toooooo dramatic but this song actually changed my life. I‚Äôll try my best to tell the short version of the story lol. 

I was living in another country pursuing a masters degree in a subject I had studied and work in for years. It was a huge adventure and career step for me. While there I also met and started dating my first long term serious boyfriend. Over the course of the first year there (it was supposed to be 3 years) things in my department started to become incredibly toxic and my classmates and I were being verbally and mentally abused on a daily basis. 

By the time summer came, they had all decided to drop out of the program, but I was the last hold out. I loved what I was studying, I loved my boyfriend (who I would‚Äôve had to leave), and I‚Äôm a stubborn person who will try and fight through anything. I debated my options for weeks trying to decide to stay or go. I even flew home to discuss the subject with my friends and family. Eventually, I decided to stay and work through it even though these people were making me cry on a daily basis. 

Then in July (a couple months later) my boyfriend came over one day and broke up with me out of the blue. It totally broke me. He was the one person I was leaning on to deal with everything else. 

After wallowing for a couple days, I turned to Taylor (as I usually do on times of pain or feeing lost). And one day ‚Äúit‚Äôs time to go‚Äù came on shuffle. After the song played through, I called my mom and told her I was reconsidering quitting and moving home. Within a couple more days, a convo with my therapist, and ‚Äúit‚Äôs time to go‚Äù on repeat, I was sending in an email of resignation. 

It was terrifying and sad and probably one of the worst times of my life. But the words in that song made me feel empowered for the first time in months. Everything felt like shit and the only thing I could now do was ‚Äúgo‚Äù. So I packed my bags and moved home. Left that shitty program, my ex-boyfriend, the life I had made, and that career path all behind.

"I think its very notable that Taylor always keeps her beards away from important events in her life. They never show up to birthday parties, award shows, or other honors. 

Have we ever even seen Joe at Taylor's birthday during that entire 6 years? This is the type of shit that just makes the fake relationships so obvious. Even if you are a ""private"" couple showing up to a massive celebrity party and just having organic interactions is NORMAL. The fact that nearly nothing of that nature exists is why I don't believe that Joe was real. But I digress..

If Taylor and Travis were in LoOoOoVvEee and going to be engaged *any minute* she couldn't STAND to be without him right? She could have had a party in Kansas City with all her WAGS friends she's pushing so hard to validate.

"I will try to bring a little bit of the perspective from Brazilian fans. I'm not blaming Taylor for anything and the fault is 100% on T4F. But I will just try to describe the sentiments on Brazilian twitter today, and I don't necessarily agree with everything I'm writing. 

Overall the sentiment is of disappointment over the way the whole situation has been handled, everyone recognizes the T4F is to blame but are upset since the very first statement Taylor put out.

A lot of people were upset that the statement was posted only on a Instagram story (disappearing after 24 hours) and that it didn't mention Ana's name.

But things got really bad yesterday after the concert and the interview that Ana's mother gave. A lot of people are upset Ana's name was not mentioned during the concert,  while it's understandable understand Taylor doesn't want to talk about it, a lot people feel like sometimes the situation requires us to do things that are hard and that upset us. While Bigger Than The Whole Sky was nice, a lot people feel like it wasn't a proper tribute to Ana because she wasn't mentioned anywhere. 

But the biggest point of disappointment her team didn't contact Ana's family to help (as stated by Ana's mom) and that they were paying everything by themselves. The videos of her mother are extremely sad. And everybody kinda of assumed her team contacted her already, it came as a big shock. Again, I recognize that maybe there are some legal issues going on, I'm just describing what I'm reading. 

There are some talks about chanting Ana's name at today's concert, if I had to guess I would say it will probably happen around champagne problems but we will see.",TaylorSwift,t3_17vv03r,2023-11-20 17:01:06,Taylor Swift,

"Not ""everything,"" but many of your extremely attractive friends, sure! I also think if it was ethical and nobody would get hurt, many people would choose to have their cake and eat it too (meaning an open relationship), because you still have a special someone with few strings attached. But many people either can't deal with the jealousy (self included) or don't have the opportunity/access.

"Hell she doesn't even really care about men because she's cool with playing with dude's hearts who accidentally and chaotically fall for her. She destroys them for loving her. Many of these guys aren't blameless, Mr. SpongeBob is definitely worse than she is for instance. But it goes to show she doesn't really care about women, men, or anyone but herself. Or at least not as much as herself. I think she loves her family, children, and her fans (in a parasocial sense I suppose) but the way she treats relationships falls extremely short of what I consider to be actual love. There's no concern for these guys' wellbeing. It's about the thrill and infatuation for her. Ariana has the same mentality as a lot of guys in their twenties but like as a thirty year old woman.

"I'm really trying not to get my hopes up about these being available when it actually premieres. 

I'm in a Halloween fb group and when the scream movie came out, they had these themed collectible popcorn buckets, and they were basically impossible to find (I didn't want one, I was just kind of observing this going down because I love niche drama). 

But from what I remember, very few people were able to get them, they were on ebay and poshmark before they even went on sale in the theaters. The theory was that maybe employees or people who know employees either stole them or were able to buy them early. 

People know now how much money you can make from cashing in on TS, so I can easily see most of them disappearing from theaters to be resold at a markup.",TaylorSwift,t3_166awrk,2023-08-31 20:10:30,Taylor Swift,

"It wasn‚Äôt at all what I expected based off the rumors and the the feel she was giving out. But tbh none of her albums ever are. I feel like midnight is truly a natural conclusion to her music.

It has few skips for me‚Äî BUT it doesn‚Äôt have a lot of my favorite songs. Other albums that‚Äôs have more skips have some of my favorite songs. 

Tbh I feel like if she were to say I‚Äôm done with music no more midnights is a full circle way to go out.

I will say though that the song is more of a description; it does not necessarily provide you with a hopeful outcome.

"I appreciate this post and the mods for taking the time to continue discussions about this issue. I do want to push back a little bit on asking people to modmail instead of publicly call out any future issues. One, I think it‚Äôs inevitable that people will post in the megathread or elsewhere if they see an issue to ask others about it. Two, that public discussion and discourse is vital to identifying the issues that the sub cares about so that the mods can address it fully and with transparency. I don‚Äôt think that asking people to keep their concerns and complaints private is totally fair. I do not condone harassment or spamming at all, but realistically people will want to hold these discussions publicly and I think that‚Äôs a core component of Reddit itself. 

Also, seeing in a reply that the ‚Äúhonorary mods‚Äù are the only ones with high level mod privileges seems flawed if they aren‚Äôt involved in a daily basis or at all. That seems oddly controlling of them and I hope for your sake and the sake of the mod team that that changes, because it feels like that‚Äôs a huge issue holding back some of what a new mod team would like to do.

"I'll be honest, when the Eras tour was announced I thought it was going to be her final victory lap. Huge tour, all the albums, one last giant hurrah, and then she'd go dark, settle down with Joe and be more of a songwriter than a performer, or pursue other things that don't require so much attention and being out in front of it all. Obviously I was completely wrong, but just from the way she writes songs about fame and disappearing from it...I really thought maybe her time away from the spotlight she realized she could live without it. But it's her life, she's gotta live it how she wants and who are we to judge her?

"I like your interpretation of ivy a lot!!

My ‚Äúwrong‚Äù interpretation of ivy is that the narrator is engaged/betrothed in some kind of arranged marriage/business deal situation arranged by her family but falls in love with someone the family doesn‚Äôt approve of (I like to think it‚Äôs a woman, that‚Äôs how the song sounds to me). In my mind the engaged couple doesn‚Äôt have any actual emotional attachment to each other/hasn‚Äôt made any promises to each other but is kind of going along with it because it‚Äôs what is expected of them, so she‚Äôs not really hurting the guy, but that‚Äôs why if the couple that‚Äôs in love doesn‚Äôt run away he‚Äôll end up being the narrator‚Äôs husband. The ‚ÄúHe‚Äù in my interpretation is a powerful/controlling father who the narrator maybe a bit afraid of, or at least afraid of disappointing

Edit: Like I said I like to interpret it as being about a woman, but as I was typing I realized that it also kinda fits Mia‚Äôs perspective in the Princess Diaries II!!

"I honestly think The Man works really well as a supporting single. Plus it has an absolutely epic music video. As a cis man, I sometimes forget about the level of privilege I have simply because of my sex and gender. Songs like The Man are a reminder that we must say ""Fuck the patriarchy"" and how women need to work harder to get on the same level as men. It shouldn't be like that. It's also flabbergasting at the different vocabulary used for men and women. In the words of Taylor, ""A man does something, it's strategic. A woman does the same thing, it's calculated. A man is allowed to react. A woman can only overreact."" 
In this world, sometimes we need songs that aren't necessarily songs we relate to but convey very important messages. In this case, it's the level of patriarchy in the music industry and society in general. And I think this indirectly conveys the importance of feminism, which I agree with as a feminist.

"This is going to be a long story... and kinda emotional for me. 
The story starts back in 2012. When I met my girlfriend Anne (fake name who is now my wife) and her family. At this time I had this idea that Taylor was a sellout and I couldn't stand her, but my future sister in law (Rae) was obsessed! And when I say obsessed, I mean every other word out of her mouth was Taylor related. Eventually, my wife and I got married. I lived with Rae as well this whole time. She was so full of life. She could walk into a room and instantly make it better. You only hear about these kind of people in books and movies- but she was real life sunshine. Unfortunately from 2012 to 2017, our family went through a lot of trauma. Anne and Rae's brother passed away, their mom became addicted to drugs, we were suffering financially, and many other personal things happened. But a few weeks before Reputation came out, the worst thing happened. Rae's boyfriend rushed into me and my wife's room at 5 am and screamed ""Rae isn't waking up."" When I ran into her room, she was blue and cold and making choking noise. I gave her CPR since she wasn't getting any air, as her boyfriend called 911. Ultimately, they took her to the hospital, but she passed away on the way there. Our whole world was shattered. The grief after losing their brother (only 8 months before Rae) was not even scabbed over, and we just lost her. The pain can never be made into words. Afterwards, no one knew what happened. They had to run an autopsy on her. But rumors started spreading that it was a drug overdose or that her boyfriend killed her. Those weeks were horrible thinking something so horrible could have happened. When we finally got the autopsy, it showed that she actually passed away due to a horrible asthma attack in her sleep (there is more that I don't wanna get into). And the day after the autopsy, Taylor released ""Ready For It."" 

As I listened to ""In the middle of the night, in my dreams, I know I'm gonna be with you- so I take my time,"" it changed me. I wanted to be with her so bad, and I felt like Taylor and Rae gave me that specific lyric. Taylor became for me, what she was for Rae for all those years. And now, I've dedicated myself to be the fan that she was for her. Plus, Taylor makes it easy.",TaylorSwift,t3_16uf58x,2023-09-29 04:59:59,Taylor Swift,

"Can anyone explain what ‚Äúpersonalization‚Äù and ‚Äúre-personalization‚Äù means, in this sense? (Thank you SO much to the original poster, Dangerous_Surprise). I mean, I know what personalizing something means, but I‚Äôm confused by this part for Milan ‚Äúresale or transfer of tickets is prohibited for personalized tickets‚Äù. I don‚Äôt have tickets for Milan, but this phrase makes me wonder what that means for other countries, if anything?

I wanted UK if possible, and my husband and I had been planning a trip to Europe next year, for the last several years. I registered for lots of cities, and unbelievably, I got codes for 7 cities/shows, but couldn‚Äôt get anything at all in the UK, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, or Spain. We ended up getting amazing seats for Vienna in August on the first level up from the floor. I couldn‚Äôt believe it! It was so easy too. I got the tickets within 15 minutes of logging in that morning. Whatever they did, they did it right!

However, it was bugging me because we hadn‚Äôt planned on going to Vienna, and it wasn‚Äôt close to the other cities I really wanted to get my husband to, next year. When I got codes for Paris at the last minute, after having been on the wait list, I was able to nab 4 VIP standing floor tickets. (Side note-is it just me, or does Paris have the WORST floor plan legend you have ever seen? I can‚Äôt tell what color goes to what section to save me, and you CANNOT enlarge it, or it‚Äôs a blur. And what‚Äôs with the pricing for each ticket showing two different prices)?? Anyway, once I got the four VIP tix for Paris, I was content. So, we are planning the trip with 2 friends and going to the South of France after the show.  I am confused on how to get into the venue with 3 other people. I will have MY passport, and the email showing that I got all four tickets, but do I need to ‚Äúpersonalize‚Äù them? Do they have to be transferred to each of them to be on their mobile devices? So many questions!!!

Now I have my Vienna tickets to sell, IF they are allowed to be resold at some point, but I don‚Äôt know how to do it, and am not opening a European bank account. I worry there are going to be empty seats in European shows that could have gone to a Swiftie, just because someone couldn‚Äôt figure out how to sell them, and no one would be allowed in without the ID of the person who bought them :(  What about a parent who bought tickets for their two teens or something? How are those teens going to get into the venue, if the mom or dad didn‚Äôt buy themselves a ticket to go?

SO many questions. Thanks in advance for any of the help you can give!

"I'm guessing it has something to do with it being a Target exclusive and not just a buy the album through my store and get a bonus track deluxe track. 

Based on everyone's reaction and hype to it though I wouldn't be surprised if she held it off till late May/early June and released it as a true single to try to get that song of the summer number 1.",TaylorSwift,t3_10jz5uu,2023-02-11 10:13:36,Taylor Swift,

"No matter how much I understand that it‚Äôs because of her experiences as a tall woman, I cannot get on with the sexy baby line in Anti-Hero. It doesn‚Äôt feel deep, or insightful, because of how cringe it is to hear - I think she could‚Äôve portrayed the message without that wording, because I think it‚Äôs an important experience to talk about but any validity is completely ruined by the intentionally inflammatory wording.",TaylorSwift,t3_14316rl,2023-06-07 18:29:49,Taylor Swift,

"I agree it's a fully, flat-out bad album.

Karma and Bejeweled sound like children's songs. Vigilante Shit is just reputation but worse. Lavender Haze is physiotherapist waiting room music. Snow on the Beach is a snooze. The only song with a real proper hook and memorable lyrics is Anti-Hero, although the ""sexy baby"" line remains very embarrassing.

WCS is the only song that's on the level of what she's capable of.",TaylorSwift,t3_17cuj0j,2023-10-21 20:01:56,Taylor Swift,
