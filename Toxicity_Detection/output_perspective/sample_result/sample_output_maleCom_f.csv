"As someone currently going to therapy, taking meds for anxiety and depression &amp; have adhd, y'all need to stfu and Leave JK alone. He debuted at 15 years old and has been working non-stop for 10 years. 

He deserves some time off to do whatever tf he wants to do before he has to enlist.

I promise you that a young adult in his 20's sitting at home with his dog, chilling out while watching Netflix eating fried chicken and having beers is normal af.

Y'all need to go outside and mind your own business instead of making up narratives trying to diagnose an idol 

What you SHOULD do is listen to what he said during the live about how he was upset that people came to his GYM and were bothering him. Worry about stalkers and how BTS (AND other idols) are constantly followed and harassed and have no privacy.

There's a girl (she's not Korean) who went to SK and got appointments with JK's tattoo artist AND his boxing trainer. like wtf?? Its so inappropriate and weird. Then she shared it to the followers she has on social media. 

Namjoon went to Spain after his Italy trip and he went with his family and WE DIDN'T KNOW. that's how it always should be

"Manila used to host BTS concerts, like 2017 and previous that. it‚Äôs just that the MOA Arena (which is the largest concert place within Metro Manila) is pretty small. Full capacity of MOA arena is like 15-20k and that‚Äôs without the provisions for stage &amp; tech. Usually MOA concerts have an audience of less than 10k. Given that, it‚Äôll be difficult to break even given cost of the production + talent / agency fee.

The next choice would be PH Arena which is barely used and only recently being used for KPOP concerts. But even now, PH fans still don‚Äôt like the arena cause the logistics are horrible!!! It took some of my friends 3 hours to get out of PARKING.

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs some vendetta against MNL or PH. It‚Äôs just logistics.",kpopthoughts,t3_112fxj6,2023-03-07 17:30:02,BTS,0.023317585,non-toxic

BTS has climbed the mountain to legendary status.  It all really no longer matters - meaning all the competition. If any other Korean artist reaches that level, they can join BTS up there but there‚Äôs no replacing them. BTS is like infinity, all the legends who reach that level are essentially all up there.  No other Korean group is there and it‚Äôs unlikely to see something similar when you consider their story, their organic growth for 9 1/2 years, etc. (no, that girl group is not at the same level no matter how much their fans want to try to compare- yes they are currently the biggest for girls, but that does not make them equal). 

That said, when they come back, I have no doubt it will be the biggest comeback that the kpop industry has ever seen, and will also blow away the global music industry. When they can do a true world tour, unencumbered by enlistment hanging over them and beyond the Covid pandemic, we will once again see their true global power.  

Also to the OP- the movie gross you quoted is just US domestic gross, and the run has been extended. Global take should  $40-50million when it‚Äôs all finished, just to add to your list.",kpopthoughts,t3_10um3xv,2023-03-08 08:17:04,BTS,0.27412915,non-toxic

"With almost every release - solo and group - I see some claims that I think have basis, that reasonably could result from the western music industry's aversion to the things they don't control, and some that seem entirely based on a delusional view of BTS as a struggling indie artist with no inroads in the west. Some that lean closer to the latter include complaints that Spotify specifically filters streams from BTS songs at an artificially higher rate, the pervasive belief that every Billboard or chart rule is targeted at BTS and its members (though I do agree that some are!), some of the claims about awards and nominations and who deserved them, even some radio complaints manage to miss the mark, and more (I can try to think of more specific examples of you need).

There are plenty of trends and specific events that I can think of that do support the fact that BTS is at the front of an industry that has a complicated relationship with the western music industry and as such has faced significant opposition, but that doesn't mean every non-perfect thing is the result of them being an underdog.",kpopthoughts,t3_1657jta,2023-08-30 09:51:05,BTS,0.11171334,non-toxic

The base of his fandom is still Army and for as long as Army sticks around, he can recover any lost ground from a 2-year hiatus should he decide to resume his solo endeavors post-enlistment -- for as long as his next musical output is just as good.

"&gt;why do they need the playlists, for what? 

are you seriously asking me why artists need playlisting? 

i agree. the solos are doing _very_ well specially like crazy. but that doesn't mean it doesn't need any push. a lot of songs that have insane longevity (dynamite and left and right as examples) are in tons of playlists. 

the thing is the fandom alone cannot sustain the streams and sales and we've seen in almost every solos (except jimin's) impressively high streams on 1st day and then, they lose streams throughout the week because they aren't being pushed.

edit: insane i'm getting donwvoted for asking bh to do their jobs lmao and by saying that armys cannot sustain high streams because fandom power alone can't give you a consistent high streams.",kpopthoughts,t3_124uae3,2023-04-11 02:20:41,BTS,0.23198941,non-toxic

"i hate being a debbie downer but i just need to let this out.

first, jimin is my ult for almost 7 years now. ü•π i've been waiting for a solo album since he first teased about it back in 2017. i **love** most of his solo/collab song and face will be my first ever kpop solo album so i'm 10000000% excited. 

and before anyone yells at me, i respect the kind of theme he was going for and i _know_ he is a part of the creative process. but it's still disappointing _for_ _me_ (emphasis on me, because if you love this, then good for you) because i feel like this concept photos could've been more. 

i love the 2nd and 3rd concept photo from hardware ver, and i can even buy into the 2nd and 3rd shots from software ver. but the first photos from the 2 versions...i dk...i just feel like they could've done more if they were going for emotional, vulnerable theme. i just don't understand how him standing with one hand inside his pocket wearing a leather jacket screams vulnerable.

i commented about this yesterday and people keep saying he's going for minimalism but i feel like the shot and pose could be much more interesting. 

when they entered the solo era, it was so good to see them work with different producers and artists, different from the ones they worked with as a group. but i feel like they still keep working with the same stylists and photographers. i know the members have a hand in these stuff but i feel like their creative team hasn't tried in years. same issues with the visual part of proof, their hit or miss styling and with the design of some of their merch.

new jeans has a complete different concept i know BUT you can see that their team is trying out different things.",kpop,t3_11ns64s,2023-04-12 02:49:02,BTS,0.32971194,non-toxic

I think that JK is underrated as a vocalist, especially by people unfamiliar with BTS. I agree with what you were saying about him being a great vocalist and what you said before. But Eunkwang in particular is notoriously one of the most versatile and technically skilled idol vocalists. Ngl I get the impression that Changsub (the second best vocalist in BTOB) is technically more skilled too, although tbh the difficulty he has because of vocal nodules is apparent.           

I say this as someone who is actually prefers BTS‚Äôs discography to BTOB‚Äôs (sorry Melodys, BTOB‚Äôs musical style is not really for me), who thinks JK‚Äôs vocal tone is great, and who thinks Eunkwang sometimes makes questionable choices with dynamics / vocal agility etc just because he knows he has the technical skill to do it.

Also, if you have been a fan of Justin for a while, you will know that his instagram posts are very random, in 2020 he posted a lot of post about god, drew house spam, or random photos. He's instagram is very random.

"It's always interesting seeing people trying to one up each other on how dangerous their areas are. I'm from London and grew up in one of the worse areas and we'd get stabbings like every other week, but it's improved a lot since. Growing up, I realised that a lot of the 'danger' ‚Äì not only in London, but a lot of cities worldwide ‚Äì, is between teenagers. A majority of the knife crimes here is dumb kids doing dumb shit. The postcode wars are insanely childish too. Most of the roadmen I knew growing up (I'm 26) either fixed up and grew up or are in prison. There's a reason you don't usually see 30 year old roadmen and it's because they grew out of it and got jobs.

London as a whole is extremely safe and I've been all over the city. A lot of British rappers talk about 'hoods' but what they really mean is their local council estate that is literally 30 seconds away from upper class detached houses. That's how the city is, you have patches of poverty just randomly spread around.

I realised that this is basically the same as New York, which has a homicide rate of like 2 per 100k (compared to London's 1 per 100k, both extremely low of course), they have strict gun laws, welfare benefits and gentrified areas like every other global city. Kind of different from how a lot of NYC rappers portray the city. I'd imagine this is the same for the UK and Canada. Every rapper does this about their city because making it sound dangerous feeds into the lifestyle that rappers like to portray.

The thing is, some areas of the USA are genuinely borderline 3rd world and even their upper areas are still more dodgy compared to usual 1st world cities. Seen St Louis mentioned and it has a homicide rate of 87 per 100k, which is extremely high. But the USA is in some ways a bunch of different countries and the states have different laws and cultures despite being united under a single entity. Therefore the USA is safer and more dangerous than a lot of countries in the world simultaneously.

I guess the point I'm making is that most rappers like to stretch the truth and it's not that serious. And that bragging about coming from a dangerous area (even if you actually come from one) is one of those things you'll look back at and cringe. I used to be one of those guys (the UK isn't just tea and crumpets üò°) but tbh I don't care anymore. I come from an actual 3rd world country, I take pride in the security of London ‚òï.",Drizzy,t3_15ez7gf,2023-08-01 10:17:15,Drake,0.509388,toxic

The previous poster mentioned that he is usually close to the side where the pathway/stairs are, and that is a good way to determine where you are standing. This is not always the case though. Another way to determine it is if you go by the placement of his band (they are under the 4 light towers closest to the center; 2 on each side of stage), he is almost always facing the same direction as the guitarist and base player.

NewJeans' success in just **6 MONTHS** of their career so far is absolutely mind-blowing.  A group breaking a record is one thing.  Then breaking a BTS record is a big thing in of itself.  Then breaking a BTS record as rookie group on their first comeback is simply insane.

"Definitely popular. Popular enough to sell out any concert here.

Mexico is one of the biggest ‚Äúaudiences‚Äù an artist can have, you can ask any rapper/singer. But also for that same reason, i wouldnt say Drake is the most popular artist here because the audience is so diverse. Mexico right now is all about reggaeton (ex. Bad Bunny) and regional mexicana (ex. Peso Pluma). Those two artists are way bigger than Drake here. Check spotify‚Äôs top 10 list for mexico and you‚Äôll see those two genres dominate.

"For all the dogs, to me is a sound that drake has perfected over the years and it feels like it‚Äôs his. There are some skips on there as 23 songs is a lot of records but to me records like; tried our best, drew a Picasso, and Away from home are some of his best work. 

I could probably swap FATD and TML as I think thank me later is super underrated album. There‚Äôs only one skip on there, though that album is very studio curated. Felt like drake felt the need to announce I can get anyone I want on a record with that album, like he officially arrived. Which is why I put FATD above it because it just feels drake perfecting drake. 

The reason it‚Äôs above all the other albums to me is because although Views and everything I put below are really solid albums I think some of it is nostalgia for fans. I remember being in college for those albums and a lot of the life experiences I had when those records came out but imo if you compare track list record by record FATD has more high tier songs on it for me than those other albums. TML and Views are probably the only debatable ones to me, I think FATD is clearly above those other albums (7-11). We‚Äôve just had more time and history with the other bodies of work so we have a more emotional connection with them but over time I think FATD is viewed as the better drake album.",Drizzy,t3_17bwffw,2023-10-20 09:47:08,Drake,0.23271075,non-toxic

"Like I said I am very new to KPOP and it's just something I heard from older ARMYS like BTS debut and pre-debut era Armys. We have a discord for older Stays and multis(age wise from 25 to 60) since we just wanted to have cordial discussions without the Twitter fanwars. I don't really have a reason to doubt them but I also added ""if true"" in my question just in case. 

Also people can't vote against someone for BBMAs? They don't have voting. As far as I understand it You can chart in

Hot 100s by supporting via streaming, buying singles and radio play. This is really hard to do for KPOP but bags in particular.
Hot 200s by buying physicals and digital albums, streaming, etc.

You can win BBMAs awards by charting consistently in either of the above.

Like am I getting this wrong or do you mean to say that about some other awards? Honestly I don't even know how anyone would vote against a group in any award apart from supporting a competitor for the same award! Do any awards have like a dislike/down vote button or something I am unaware of? I am a bit confused and if you could please further elaborate on how other fandoms voted against them, I would really appreciate it.

Just as an aside We streamed both performances at BBMAs as well as celebrated JK, new jeans and SKZ wins. I myself posted in the discord about JKs win since it was first to be announced I think. So there really are no hard feelings amongst us about any of the stuff happening outside discord itself.",kpop_uncensored,t3_1813sl4,2023-11-22 18:22:45,BTS,0.17025198,non-toxic

"It's harder now to have a long-lasting hit, I think. Most mega hits are worked on by big-name writers and producers (like any Weeknd or Taylor Swift hit) and Drake doesn't seem to want to do that at this point. He seems content to put out these catchy trap songs and see if they pop off the way God's Plan did. Personally I would love to see him try for another big moment by working with some new people; no shame in really swinging for the fences for a lead single.

Question, since Multiply‚Äôs 10 year anniversary is coming up, will an X deluxe edition vinyl record be made, with the 4 extra songs (Take It Back, Shirtsleeves, Even My Dad Does Sometimes, and I See Fire)?

"Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account is less than one day old. We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

"Over the years, he wrote some amazing verses for BTS tracks and his solo releases! He is relatable and also inspirational. 

Hard to choose, but some of my favorites are (translations by doolset):

>From when it went wrong, I‚Äôm not really sure  
>  
>From when I was young, there‚Äôs been a blue question mark in my mind

(Blue and Grey)  A good meditation on why some of us live with sadness as a shadow (or tendency to think deeper about things)

>I always wanted to become the best  
>  
>So I was impatient and anxious  
>  
>To compare myself against others became my daily life,  
>  
>and my greed, which used to be my weapon, became a leash that chokes me

(Magic Shop)

>I believe myself and that my back‚Äôs hurting is  
>  
>for the wings to sprout  
>  
>I believe you and that though now it seems humble  
>  
>in the end you‚Äôll leap into a prosperous future

(Outro Wings)

>Yeah why does God keep  
>  
>making us lonely  
>  
>Yeah even if we‚Äôre covered in bruises,  
>  
>we can smile if we‚Äôre together

(A Supplementary Story: You Never Walk Alone)

>For the first time in my life in mother‚Äôs womb  
>  
>I used to count the days until my first moving  
>  
>Vague memory, the cost of my moving was  
>  
>A machine in my mom‚Äôs heart and a big scar

(Moving On)

>Words that are carelessly directed at me soon become a wall  
>  
>Even my loneliness is a pretending in your eyes

(Whalien 52) 

>Whether or not you‚Äôre young, old, or have a hidden child,  
>  
>I don‚Äôt care because I love you

(Miss Right) 

>I walked through the tunnels without any lights, alone  
>  
>I thought I was alone, but then learned that it was seven  
>  
>Rather than being barefoot, I wear the shoes that are called ‚ÄúBangtan‚Äù  
>  
>and go forward another step, afresh, more

(Road)

>The root of my creation is Han I have tasted the world‚Äôs sweetness, bitterness, and even shit  
>  
>The time when I tried to sleep on a bathroom floor is now a memory to me uh it became a memory  
>  
>I debuted holding onto my fucking crushed shoulder thanks to the accident on my part-time delivery job  
>  
>In front of whom do you think you‚Äôre pretending you‚Äôve gone through hardships

(The Last)

>Every morning, I‚Äôm scared to open my eyes and breathe (...)  
>  
>I hope everything disappears like a mirage, I hope  
>  
>I even hope my damn self disappears

(So Far Away)

>When you‚Äôre smiling, don‚Äôt ever forget about those who‚Äôre crying  
>  
>Because it‚Äôs your smile that helps them live through the day (...)  
>  
>You, surviving on snoozes to get closer to your dream, it‚Äôs okay to rest (...)  
>  
>Just laugh out loud, as if you‚Äôll laugh the world away (...)  
>  
>Dream, I hope it to be there with you at your creation and at the end of your life

"That's a bad thing for most ppl and companies bcuz the companies make bank from that, and many young fans are fans bcuz of the whole bf/gf fantasy. Unfortunately all the shit like sexualizing underage idols, bf/gf fantasy, shipping members within the group, etc is why kpop is thriving. Taking it away would make for healthier idols and fans, but I think then kpop would only be popular among older ppl (late 20s/prob early 30s and up), who would just be casual fans, as opposed to the super young and impressionable obsessed stans that buy merch in bulk and always stream mvs, which contribute a lot to their idols' fame and wealth. Companies have no incentive to take any of this away tbh, and I think they r only rlly tryna find more loopholes and ways to maximize interest in groups using all these methods that are quite maladaptive for fans and unhealthy for the idols, all in the name of fame and money tbh",kpopthoughts,t3_18mz8un,2023-12-22 19:47:48,Ed Sheeran,0.52139956,toxic

The crowd has been progressively getting better since the first show, when people just didn't know what to expect, but today was the first time at a BTS concert where I truly feared for my eardrums lol. People around me were rapping and singing to every song at the top of their lungs, finding a way to get even louder when prompted by Yoongi, screaming their heads off when they couldn't keep up with some of his more furious bars. It was obvious that the vast majority of the crowd was dedicated fans who were familiar with all the songs on the setlist and could therefore appreciate the production of the entire show. 

I'm gonna be completely honest and say that the concerts I've been to post-pandemic have never quite captured the intensity of the concerts I was lucky enough to attend pre-pandemic, but tonight really felt like it matched those pre-COVID concerts in terms of fan fervor. It was fucking awesome to be surrounded again by a group of fans who could sing along to every song and weren't afraid to dance and yell and have FUN. SERIOUSLY PEOPLE, IF YOU'RE GOING TO JUST STAND ON FLOOR LIKE A STATUE, RECORDING AND BERATING OTHER PEOPLE FOR HAVING THE AUDACITY TO WAVE THEIR ARMS AND DANCE THEREBY ""RUINING"" YOUR FUCKING VIDEOS, STAY THE FUCK HOME (literally witnessed this at the second show at UBS). 

As for the show itself, what more can be said than that Min Yoongi put on another spectacular show. I feel like the setlist is close to perfection, giving the fans everything we've wanted and then some. But the one thing that stood out to me on all three nights that I can't seem to get over was his singing. I was honestly blown away by how good he sounded and then I was further blown away when he admitted during his weverse live today that he didn't like the vocal lessons he received so he just practiced on his own. Seriously, how many more talents does this man have? And I find it so endearing that he went out of his way to hone his other talents so that he could make the show that much more memorable for us. It truly feels like he respects and actually gives a shit about us. 

There were so many little moments that are going to make this day stand out for me from the other shows:  Yoongi's bewildered face at his guitar string breaking, scolding the crowd for being a little too happy to see Jimin, shunning iPhone users, his amused encouragement of the barking lol; so many good memories tonight on top of a flawless show put on by a seemingly indefatigable Min Yoongi. If Yoongi wasn't your bias before, I feel like you'll come out of his shows as one. 

But I can't say it wasn't a day without its hiccups. Tbh, I was pretty fucking miserable all afternoon up until soundcheck started; the chaos of Live Nation's handling of soundcheck just soured everything and the weather was definitely not helping. It's been unseasonably cold for the past week and it rained steadily all day, the wind blowing sheets of rain into us and getting those of us who didn't have a poncho get progressively more and more damp as the temperature continued to drop. By the time we finally entered the arena I was shivering like mad and was barely able to speak in coherent sentences with my linemate who I was loudly complaining to (I'm sorry to everyone around me who had to suffer my negativity). I could write an essay about all the negative things about the concert experience but what's most important and what overrides all is that Army tonight was beyond awesome and Yoongi put on a fan-fucking-tastic show that I'll remember for the rest of my life. Seeing him smile and obviously enjoying himself throughout the show made all the inconveniences I have to suffer worth it and want to do it again and again.

I hope Army who have yet to see him have as much fun as I have over these past few days. And for those fans who are on the fence about going and haven't bought tickets yet, DO IT, DO IT, DO IT, I promise, you will not regret it.",bts7,t3_1339vc9,2023-06-25 21:43:43,BTS,0.19124292,non-toxic

"1.	Face-off: The way the song starts, it tells you to throw away whatever perception you may have of this album, he sings in such a raw way, he goes growling to a beautiful high voice. He does sound angry and reading some translation, it does come across that he‚Äôs letting things go.

2.	Interlude: Dive: Great intermission that sets the tone for the rest of the album (love how they always give little shout-outs to BTS, here he‚Äôs using his introduction at the Busan concert).

3.	Like Crazy: What a song, it‚Äôs such a banger, Pdogg did his thing again (I love how everyone acknowledges that when he hits, he really hits). Such a good song that doesn‚Äôt lean too much to the 80‚Äôs sound because it still sounds fresh.

4.	Alone: Love it, he sounds so wistful and the lyrics do lean that way, as always, being at the top looks easy but it‚Äôs anything but. I‚Äôm glad he has found a way to express his feelings. Love the instrumental.

5.	Set Me Free Pt. 2: Now that we know how the album‚Äôs narrative goes, I can see why this was chosen as its last original song. I think that along with the MV, Jimin has found a way to ‚Äúbe free‚Äù especially since the last shot of the mv has him wearing white.

6.	Like Crazy (Eng. Version): Sometimes, english versions can come off as meh but this doesn‚Äôt come across like that, it feels like it‚Äôs its twin.

7.	Letter (CD Only): What a beautiful song that aligns to his sound in Promise that is basically a love letter to the members who have stood by him all these years.

He‚Äôs been talking about how this album reflects his thoughts during the pandemic and the first thing that I thought of was how devastated he was during MOTS: One where he cried and was visibly very affected.

Overall, Bangtan solos just don‚Äôt miss. Jimin has his hands in writing every single song and if this is just his first album, I can‚Äôt wait to see what else he will do.

And that‚Äôs how it circulates, someone close to them isn‚Äôt a real friend, spills and or someone overhears when they‚Äôre talking about it in the open. E.g people found out Shawn and Camila broke up cause she was opening out loud on a plane and got overheard.

There‚Äôs so many celebrities too who openly have admitted to having threesomes. Having people talk about their hookups is more common than you think.

"Well, I specifically asked if Jimin bears responsibility because he took time getting inspired, as you said. Perhaps he's a procrastinator? Except his creation came about because of the dark period of his life during the Pandemic, so there is that. 

It is not Tae's fault. But Tae was allowed to follow his own schedule. I don't feel as confident as you that Jimin was. I do not remember Jimin ever saying that he preferred working at that kind of intensive pace. I mean, seriously, who would? 

I also don't blame Tae for getting a visual album. I think it's great, actually, and am very curious as to what he will produce. You can choose to disbelieve that if you want. I've been following and admiring and discussing BTS--and Jimin--for years now, but if choose to believe that I'm some sort of toxic solo stan--the ultimate insult!--so be it. 

I don't think Jimin is a victim. I think he's is a member of the biggest group in the world and a very talented and successful artist in his own right. And I certainly don't think I know more than Jimin about creating an original and astounding work. 

But yeah, I do think the company bungled his debut. And FACE should have had a visual album as well. I would have loved to have experienced that. 

Btw, it's not a veneer of civility.  I just don't tend to throw hissy fits unless it's for something a lot more important. And please don't feel that you need to respond. I wrote this more as a way to explain myself to others.",kpopthoughts,t3_15l5ixf,2023-08-09 01:40:30,BTS,0.10956833,non-toxic

"Will it change fandom dynamics: yes  
Will it change BTS dynamics and their future: no

As simple as that. And why I used the word ""change"" rather than ""ruin"" is because army's such a huge ass fandom and in all the seven years I've been in kpop I've seen majority of armys being ot7 ones. Like ik they have biases, and yes there are solo stans, but when it comes to supporting the group as a whole, armys just gather themselves as quick as they divide themselves based on solo stanning. So let's just wait for the big day, and we'll see even solo stans joining in be it only for their member, but they will be there. Plus the phenomenal turnout at D-Day puts your argument to skepticism. And what do I even say about BTS, they've already time and again made it clear it's like a vacation mode for them wait till they get together they'll definitely come back stronger and better",kpop_uncensored,t3_173fdr7,2023-10-09 06:53:44,BTS,0.40891263,toxic

"Your last paragraph show that you really dont know how grammy nom work. Grammy wont nominate artist just because of rating. Grammy voters n grammy organizers are 2 separate things. Grammy voters only care about votings. While the latter only care about rating. Grammy organizers only get to choose who perform after they get to know who get nominated. However, there still some exception regarding performances for some veteran artists like silk sonic did debut stage for leave door open or very popular one like BTS(collab for old town road remix performance).

With BTS still not winning, i believe that grammy voters have higher standard when its come to kpop artists. And they already have see BTS as standard for kpop artists. Mean i think they probably expecting other kpop artists need to get no1 hot100 n have tonssss of performances plus tonsss of music interviews in order to get nominated. Just look at blackpink. They are 2nd kpop group after bts but they have never get nominated despite have even collabed with many western artists. I think only army gonna realize whats kind promo bts did to get noticed by grammy voters. I truly believe having hit song still not enough. For example joji not get nominated at all even if for glimpse of us were very huge last year. I suspected its because joji rarely promoted n performed the song. POC especially asians probably being expected to do extra work to get noticed by grammy voters. Thus, i think its not gonna be that easy for kpop artists to get nominated. But i do believe BTS would finally win grammy one day n i wont be surprised if they still the only one get nominated n win.",kpopthoughts,t3_10xw259,2023-03-08 02:36:46,BTS,0.16158698,non-toxic

"I think the critic has some good points here.
If I can take Harry's side though, as the critic mentioned his tour started in 2021, it is possible the whole thing has been dragged a bit and as a result enthusiasm was not at the highest peaks right to the end.

I like Harry's music, I am not expecting it to give me the goosebumps, but it is bubbly, it makes me smile, it does bright my mornings so I think it does the job.

With that being said, I also think social media and the whole reel situation is ruining the feelings we have around some of our favourites hits by Mr Style.
The very same reason why, back in the days, you did not want to listen too many times to your favourite songs in fear you would not like them anymore. I am afraid that is what is happening with most of Harry's hits.",popculturechat,t3_14ztjtm,2023-07-15 01:32:33,Harry Styles,0.05378982,non-toxic

"I'm impressed about some of the responses calling it terrible, and I might know why is that. I really like his music, I was there an hour before he came up, whatever he'd do was fine for me, passionfruit in loop for an entire hour? Fuck yeah. I was dreading to hear sicko mode, or nonstop live. I don't pay much attention to any criticism or discussions related to music though, I just listen to what I like, and I liked the show, but:

If you don't like his music that much and you were all the way back, I perfectly understand. Drake didn't give an epic show. All he did was come up on stage and sing some of the bangers with the crowd. I think it gets a bit in the discussion of ""thats not a show! A real show must have a guitar, a bass, a keyboard... etc"". But as everybody, I happen to like some music more than other despite the efforts put into the production of it.

There isn't much effort put into the show, because he doesn't care, and he knows that his fans would take anything, as I did. This is really lame.

I will say that the show Drake gave us could've been better, the crowd here makes it a great deal. But I loved it, I was jumping, singing, it was nuts.

100% sure the majority of people were not Drake fans. The fans were people like me, who cared enough to get really close to stage. It's a festival so the public is very general.

As you know, english is not our primary language.
I've listened to every Drake album dozens of times, but the lyrics are much much harder to understand without reading them and specially remember, and my top genre is hip-hop, nas, kanye, jay-z. I've listened to illmatic hundreds and hundreds of times, and I still can't sing along every song! I consider myself pretty good at english too.

That's my excuse to why we only sang the bangers.

And sorry, my writing skills in english are kinda clunky",Drizzy,t3_11urzd7,2023-04-11 09:10:12,Drake,0.4977744,toxic

"This constant victimization culture has gone out of the hand. And it's really sad that what happens in America happens to K-Pop fandom as a whole. People thinks that they are victims of the story and project that into K-Pop idols and always think that they should've been saved because of ""mistreatment"". When i thought about this word ""mistreatment"", this just slowly feels like a victimization fantasy that they unconsciously seek to satisfy their delusional ""hero"" arch and these K-Pop fans self-illusionized entire people or other K-pop idols as villains.

I'm tired with this ""us vs them"" mentality fueled with victimization fantasy like this. BTS doesn't need your borderline victimization, they already grow up, not even other K-Pop groups ffs. Let other K-Pop groups to achieve same position as them, despite they won't be ""like"" them, just like letting people to try achieve the same position that The Beatles or Michael Jackson stand on",kpopthoughts,t3_14gba7u,2023-06-22 20:28:06,BTS,0.3057765,non-toxic

"Before the pandemic and in my late 40‚Äôs I probably saw a band or a comedian every couple weeks‚Ä¶ I did not pay anything close to what this costs for any show ever.  I think the most expensive seat I ever bought was like $300 to get a seat in the mezzanine at the Tower Theater to see Radiohead in the late oughts (worth every penny by the way)‚Ä¶ but I told her at 11 when I pocketed a grand for the tickets I had to sell for the Eilish show that we would use the money for her first show.  

I would much rather keep it in savings or use it for something else, but I feel like this is one of those things that if I don‚Äôt make good on I‚Äôll never feel good about it.  She is a good kid.",Drizzy,t3_13rlkhx,2023-06-27 13:15:24,Drake,0.059479803,non-toxic

">Like, just off the veryyyyy little info ik of idols' stardom in SK

Regarding BTS' or Blackpink's individual members it is quite possible to get a better picture out of other content and its general content. In the Game Caterer show of Na PD in the picture game (where they are shown pictures and they have to say the name in 3 seconds) pictures of the individual members have been shown. So in the game context it's a given that people recognize them very fast.

Then there are the video clips of movie premieres where whenever one of them attends they get as much or more hype than the very A-List actors. Or regarding BTS that they've now been multiple times (as news or even interviewees) in basically prime time TV news of the big broadcasters.

And one example just because it's so funny: When RM went to the Bruno Mars concert and multiple attendeed recognized him with a mask, hat and glasses when he [walked by them.](https://x.com/macitystar/status/1670447300525604866?s=20).

So all the context clues show that they do have individual recognizability, which will grow even more now due to all their continueing solo ventures.",kpopthoughts,t3_17of6a4,2023-11-05 20:16:08,BTS,0.12520397,non-toxic
