">in general, i think that musicians like miley and her music. she doesnt make too many waves negatively in the industry. 

I think so too.

And a fun fact about this Flowers credit discussion: Just a few years ago, Miley worked with Andrew Wyatt, one of the ""When I was Your Man"" writers, so she knows him very well. And for all we know, they may have talked about the song and informally agreed that he didn't deserve any credits. And I'm sure her record label lawyers went through it carefully and confirmed there was no formal copyright issues anyway. 

Miley has made 8 studio albums, some EP's and live albums. She has also done probably close to 100 cover songs. But she has never ever been sued or accused of any copyright infringement related to her music. (or vice versa) That is actually pretty rare nowadays as you point out.  Miley comes across as very knowledgeable and respectful towards other artists work, and has even said how she rather colab with other artists instead of making something that sounds too similar.",popculturechat,t3_16c29b2,2023-09-07 17:14:48,Miley Cyrus,0.06896287,non-toxic

Energy levels also go up during the second trimester because the placenta takes over.

"Congrats to these two dummies for destroying a family for no reason, because they lack self-control. 

This happens with a lot of people who have affairs, so even if the entire world weren’t totally against their relationship and writing about it in tabloids, it likely would’ve ended just as quickly. 

People enjoy their affairs because it’s NOT their actual partner. They feel no responsibility to their affair partner and are free to project whatever they want onto them. They romanticize the relationship because they never have to face the real problems that people face in a relationship, and they also enjoy the thrill of sneaking around. 

When people actually break up with their spouse and try to start a relationship with their affair partner, it almost always ends badly because they can no longer project their fantasy onto the affair partner, and the thrill is gone.",popculturechat,t3_15cr3vv,2023-07-29 14:12:42,Ariana Grande,0.39915034,non-toxic

Slightly off topic here, but I’m wondering if anyone in the group has 2 tickets for Taylor Swift next year in Indianapolis (11/1-3) that might be open to some form of a trade for 2 tickets to Adele on Jan 19. I got them as a gift, but plans aren’t working out for a Vegas trip. The seats are in section 405, Row H, seats 514 and 515. I’m open to paying a difference or whatever we can come up with.

I’ve been saying this for years. No one can heal themselves through writing. The fact that karma is her end all be all says enough about how she needs real therapy to learn to forgive people and let go afterwards. She seems to think forgiveness makes you weak and vulnerable but it doesn’t. It helps us to move on from harmful situations if we forgive and Taylor just can’t seem to do that. I really wish she would see that and heal because while writing can be cathartic it isn’t helping if years later it’s still there in her heart and mind. Like the way she sings about her need to self sabotage and be over dramatic in love? Like girl that isn’t healthy. No long term relationship is ever going to work if you can’t figure yourself out and why you do the things you do. I want her to heal and let go of the past trauma.,TaylorSwift,t3_17w4x83,2023-11-16 16:27:55,Taylor Swift,0.1182615,non-toxic

"The bridge of dress is about Joe/2016 Met Gala. That doesn't mean the song as a whole has to be about him (we know she loves a good bait and switch), but that line was written specifically as a nod to him. There might be a convenient double meaning, but I don't think Karlie cutting her dress is the original inspiration for that lyric and I honestly don't think she even intended to reference it at all. In cases where the public narrative might not match the truth, I think she intentionally writes some lyrics with no hidden meaning just to play up that public narrative. 

I understand the desire to find an alternate explanation for every lyric she's written that doesn't fit your particular idea of what happened, but I think it's pretty likely that there are all kinds of lyrics in her discography (and not just in songs about relationships) that aren't necessarily true but are put there to shape a particular public narrative, and I don't think that's a bad or dishonest thing to do *most* *of the time.* It's not like she owes us 100% non-fictional music as long as the fictional part doesn't end up doing real damage (like painting a good person in a really bad light or something).",GaylorSwift,t3_18hwinq,2023-12-14 20:35:47,Taylor Swift,0.12260055,non-toxic

"Have you actually looked into those subs?

I really don't mind posts like ""NJ songs aren't as great as people make them out to be"" or ""I find NJ songs not interesting"", like, that's totally valid differing opinions.

But many of the threads are ""anyone who supports NewJeans in any way or even just listens to them is supporting child abuse"". People think it's okay to hate anything NewJeans including the group itself because of the controversy around Min Heejin.

I do not think daily exposure to people calling you a supporter of child abuse because you like a music group is healthy, no.

I've also seen several very harmless posts that were positive about NewJeans being downvoted to 0. It's just as much an echo chamber, just in the other direction.

"I’ve seen at least one comment over at r/boxoffice speculating that it has the potential to put up Avengers: Endgame numbers opening weekend, especially as more theaters pick it up.

It was not unheard of for girls to see Titanic with their friends 5, 10, even 15 times.

"Her music is great but it absolutely in no way, shape or form is pop punk. Her music has virtually zero commonality with the genre. She produces (very good) pop music with element of soft rock and pop rock. Her success to me seems to be built upon having a strong, elastic musical-theatre voice that she has great control over at lower registers, with the ability to offer some power at a moment’s notice. She knows how to make a song swell. 

Go listen to State Champs, Blink 182, Good Charlotte, Green Day, All Time Low, Neck Deep etc as a more accurate representation of the genre.",popculturechat,t3_16ux0he,2023-09-29 16:44:48,Olivia Rodrigo,0.17545098,non-toxic

"I said this in the post yesterday about this. Idk. The more I think about it the more I just feel that so many “hate campaigns” on the internet really just lean on social justice buzzwords and topics as a way to disguise their real intent: misogyny. 

I’m struggling to think of a single instance where deep down hate for women wasn’t the driving force for all this. Hell I would go so far as to say the recent hand wringing over pedro pascal being called daddy is really just a weird sexist campaign! 

idk if he’s a victim I can only hope he gets the help he needs sooner rather than later, but I can’t help but think so many people who claim to care about his well-being don’t actually care about what happen to him or care about preventing this kind of thing from happening again.",popculturechat,t3_10gmbtk,2023-02-11 15:24:16,Taylor Swift,0.3389984,non-toxic

"She was talking A LOT about Barbados pre performance. I wish she had incorporated the culture more, like she did at the VMA’s. I was hoping to see some crop over (inspired)outfits. But Barbados wasn’t THERE, like she said in her own words.

I think the performance suffered from wanting to include too many hits. It felt really rushed. Although it’s one of my favourite songs, pour it up could’ve been left out, as there was practically nothing interesting happening on stage. The pregnancy really limited her. She’s never been a big dancer but if you look at the vma performance you see that she was actually able to move and follow a choreography. This time all she could do was walk while the dancers moved around her. This is the same thing that hurt the dance section, especially we found love.

"I am fairly confident it’s about her ex, Zach Bia. There’s a 7 year age difference there and the song touches on emotional abuse. 

“Went for me and not her. Cause girls your age know better” is something many who have previously dated someone older but emotionally immature relates to. Often men date younger women because they are easier to control, since they often don’t know any better. 

The song doesn’t really make sense if you think about Taylor. Glaringly obvious, the line “cool guy, you got it”. I think people *want* there to be drama between the two but it’s very clear that Olivia is taking the high road.

"I don’t like it and think we should normalize saying we prefer the old versions. To me, some of the little vocal imperfections were what made the old songs special. I love the sass in the original Style’s “oh, you’ve been out and about…” I love the way she sings “take me home.” It’s just not the same in the new one and while I like and appreciate it, I just prefer the original. 

Same with Wonderland. The old song had an exaggerated zaniness to it that perfectly evoked the surreal nature of “wonderland.” That’s missing for me in the new version. 

On the other hand, I prefer the TV Wildest Dreams and This Love. 

Some songs I like the old, and some the new. It’s all about how well I think the vocals suit the general atmosphere of the song, not about how technically perfect the vocals are.",TaylorSwift,t3_180vble,2023-11-22 01:04:28,Taylor Swift,0.20839658,non-toxic

"i like that you put the reference to how you are listening. i've found my experience to be quite different based on what kind of audio medium i'm listening through (so far have tried over-ear noise-canceling, airpods, IEMs, and car speakers...). 

worst overall experience of TV has been the over-ear headphones and best is a toss-up between IEMs (i guess for being able to hear all the details) and car speakers (to get that feel of being enveloped in sound). 

i think across all the mediums, i've found Style TV to be the most disappointing (though to be fair could be because it's one of her more iconic songs, so even a small downgrade can feel outsized) and the most improved to be Out of the Woods TV (*vast* improvement imo... possibly the biggest improvement out of all of her re-records because for me it went from promising but mid to DAMN this is one hell of a song).",TaylorSwift,t3_17jcw7x,2023-10-30 23:25:53,Taylor Swift,0.05898502,non-toxic

If you're not the sort of person to get deeply involved in fandoms, it's easy to see the people who are ***super*** into everything Taylor (or any other fandom, really) and feel like you don't belong. If it helps, try to imagine how Taylor might feel about you being a fan - do you think she'd care that you don't make bracelets or participate in easter egg hunts? I don't. I think she'd probably just be happy that her music means a lot to you and has helped you through hard times.

The only requirement to be a fan of an artist is to enjoy their music - everything else is optional. You can engage with as much or as little of it as you want, take what you like and leave the rest.

"Thanks Hanni very useful to say how much we need to see this video but not giving the channel name lol

I mean I guess they can't? I know they can't talk about brands that don't colabore with them, but how much of a ""brand"" is considered a YT channel? I mean Mr.Beast is obviously considered a brand, but a small channel that talks about phycology and movies? I don't think so. 

So don't know why ADOR wouldn't let her recommend a small YT channel, or why Hanni would talk about it if she knew that in the end she wouldn't be able to say the channel's name. 

Or maybe this is a marketing strategy because Danielle will open her own YT channel doing phycologycal analisis of movies (she would say that but in the end we all know she would mostly only talk about La La Land and Sound of Music, she loves La La Land and Sound of Music), the name will be Jerry Movie Analisis.",NewJeans,t3_17ps7xg,2023-11-07 13:52:50,New Jeans,0.21107252,non-toxic

"That’s not at all what I said? It’s no surprise you don’t understand my stance.

I’m saying that marketing tactics can lead you to believe one thing to be true, even if it’s not. And that’s very common in music, where a good marketing team can absolutely impact a song’s success even if the song by all means simply average. Advertising campaigns, commercial licensing, a viral music video or audio, can all turn into sales and streams easily.",popheads,t3_18flibj,2023-12-11 15:45:30,Billie Eilish,0.026028076,non-toxic

"Thanks for the shoutout. I should have also mentioned that all this is, I think, visible in the way she's presented herself over the years - the baby voice, childish demeanor, losing weight to stay small and flat chested, she even talks quietly and types in all lower-case to make herself appear smaller, more innocent. All the while simultaneously being overtly, explicitly sexual. I mention all this because these can be signs of trauma from childhood sexual assault/exploitation. Schneider is one thing but who even knows if he was the first person to put her in that situation or whether she was told to comply by a parent/agent/someone she trusted.

I know I'm just doing armchair psychology here but I think Ari as a person makes a lot more sense when you take that trauma into consideration.",popculturechat,t3_1553hfc,2023-07-21 18:39:14,Ariana Grande,0.36867723,non-toxic

You're asking for tickets under $500 for her very last show in Vegas.

I personally don’t really care deeply for Taylor, of course I wish her happiness and her music has been a constant in my life for decades but I’m aware her music and her persona are probably just a commercial façade she puts on.

"A reality check: Taylor directly benefits from, and encourages this type of behavior. She has capitalized on her presence being a spectacle for years. If one avails oneself of the benefits of fame ($$$, private jets, etc.), I think it's fair to also expect the downsides, as with any benefit that one can derive in this life. Costs and benefits.

&#x200B;

For the record. Do I encourage this freakish stalkerish inappropriate behavior? No. Absolutely not. But Taylor has opened Pandora's box and idk if she can close it at this point, sadly. And, also sadly, I don't think any of the well-meaning, privacy respecting Swifties in this group can reel in the inappropriate fans who selfishly risk Taylor's safety for their own chance to catch a glimpse of her. :-/",TaylorSwift,t3_15vuyl7,2023-08-20 09:04:55,Taylor Swift,0.32236105,non-toxic

 I dont totally agree with you. You dont have to support someone just because they are the same ethnicity. I can also understand why people in Vietnam would be opposed to people who support South Vietnam due to all the history and pain there. People unstan and stop supporting people over politcal and personal reasons all the time. If a large part of the Vietnamese fan base stop supporting her over this it is up to them. While  I agree her family's actions are not hers and should not nessacarily impact her career it is up to fans to decide if they support her or not. As long as people are not sending unnecessary hate or threats I see no issue with people not supporting anymore. Also I doubt many people will actually completly stop supporting over this.,kpopthoughts,t3_10vepi2,2023-03-08 07:13:13,New Jeans,0.112643376,non-toxic

"I just got tickets to Sydney night one! 
This system was so unfair and that’s me saying that when I just benefited from it. I sat with two different accounts/devices/networks for five hours today and didn’t get anything. Went to do school pick up and all the afternoon stuff you do with kids. Put the iPad back into the queue around 4:45. Randomly checked my phone in the queue for five minutes an hour later and got in to get tickets. iPad still hasn’t let me in. We wanted to buy five tickets across two accounts so our whole family could go, even if we are split up. VIP packages were still available for every night.
Ticketek knew it would be a hard day, but I think if they had been a little more transparent they would have had less people upset. Just saying 40% of the stadiums are VIP packages and we are releasing 60% of the tickets today (or whatever their numbers are) would have helped set expectations.

"Stubhub is pretty legit, you don’t get the tickets right away because ticketmaster doesn’t allow it to transfer until a few days before the event. The way it works is that people will put their tickets on sale, but Stubhub doesn’t ask for proof, so it’s basically on the honor system. However, if someone buys your tickets and you don’t actually have them, then the seller gets charged the full amount that they resold the “tickets” for. So yeah, most people won’t put listings unless they for sure have their tickets. Even if they don’t have the tickets  and you buy them, you will get fully reimbursed for whatever you paid for. Also, a tip would be to buy the concert tickets as close to the concert date as you can, since it gets cheaper and more sellers want the tickets off their hands.

I mean she's a pop rock artist which I think historically had a weird relationship to the rock genre (people like Sheryl Crow were kind of outsiders in the genre despite clearly being rockers and tom DeLonge was made to feel disillusioned to his cred as a rock star because of negative attention from rock critics). It's possible that maybe rock tastemakers and artists want the genre back if that makes sense because the old guard is gone and now guys like Dave Grohl and Jack white are the elder statesman. Like rock needs a way forward and a reclaim of sounds lost to other genres is probably the only real path.,popheads,t3_1603zaw,2023-08-24 15:52:50,Olivia Rodrigo,0.09611836,non-toxic

"Totally agree with this!

I can understand why she put herself on the spotlight when NJ is debuting, her name is known and it help to get NJ into conversation and get ppl to check out NJ.

But now she has successfully launched NJ into the highest orbit of the kpop industry and NJ already have an established name and recognition. And people has rightly recognized her for her genius work on NJ.

At this point what can derail NJ is just bad music (unlikely from their track record) and controversies/scandal. 

So i hope and predict that she pulls herself away from the spotlight (to let ppl focus on NJ and their music) and focus on the works behind the scene to keep NJ on track in producing top tier music and contents.",NewJeans,t3_10tt1xl,2023-03-08 09:33:46,New Jeans,0.063423134,non-toxic

"Exceptionally done once again. The music just hits and most likely will be listened to on repeat for a long time like their debut songs (i mean i still listen to them a lot), the mv is great and really breaks out of the at this point kinda boring kpop concepts, ador has a vision and is going for it. Awesome!
