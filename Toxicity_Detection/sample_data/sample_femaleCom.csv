"Just a heads up, when I went to the show last weekend the FedEx‚Äôs in three hotels were out of the poster tubes (Ceasers, Flamingo, and Westgate) by Saturday. The manager at the Flamingo one told me they only get 10-12 tubes to a box, ordered three boxes for Mon/Tues delivery, they were gone by Friday mid afternoon.  Between U2 and Adele there has been a run on them so keep that in mind if you‚Äôll be looking to pick up a tube there. 
They do have a flat box that they can ship the poster in (exact size). Also if you‚Äôre going to ship the tube it would be more because it‚Äôs classified as an ‚Äúunusual size‚Äù and they charge an extra fee for that. 
The manager was incredibly kind (we flew one of the discount airlines and only had one personal item for our trip so bringing it on the plane wasn‚Äôt an option for me) and cribbed together a tube for me out of two tubes that had been previously cut so I could mail my poster back. Even comped the unusual size fee too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/adele/comments/17n975c/poster_tubes_for_show_poster/,Poster Tubes for Show Poster,adele,t3_17n975c,/r/adele/comments/17n975c/poster_tubes_for_show_poster/,2023-11-04 00:14:51,Adele

"&#x200B;

**From X:**

There‚Äôs a big Korean Entertainment YouTuber reporter who discussed about why NewJeans ghosted Mnet/MAMA. We all know what happened at MAMA 2022 with NewJeans but he also said MHJ was heartbroken/angry at having NewJeans be the stand in to accept Breakout Producer award for her while NewJeans ended up not winning any award. It was like MAMA was saying NewJeans is successful only because of MHJ and her producing disrespecting the group. Also in the comments not sure if this is true but a few said NewJeans canceled an existing schedule on 11/30 (meaning NewJeans were originally planning to attend only for the first day) to attend the second day of MAMA because Mnet told Ador there will be an award to accept for the second day only for it to be an award for MHJ. In summary, MHJ is angry at MAMA more because of what MAMA made NewJeans do at the award show full knowing there was no reason for them to attend both days than NewJeans not getting a meaningless fluff award. Based on MHJ boycotting Mnet all 2023 speaks to how her first priority has always been NewJeans despite MAMA giving her the producer award last year. It makes more sense to me now. It wasn‚Äôt the award. It was the lack of respect for NewJeans and their time and effort.

&#x200B;

**Additional comment:**

1. This makes sense why they showed up in the same outfits day 2.
2. That‚Äôs why they only have one outfit for 2 days‚Ä¶ because there is no day 2 in the schedule

Can anyone share their interpretation regarding this whole part of the conversation? 

Is Billie saying...she tried to look ""conventionally feminine"" and was hated, so now she is going out of her way to present herself in public wearing the exact **opposite** of what is expected of women? Doesn't that still confirm the public has a giant hold on what she feels she can wear? I'm kind of sad to learn she still feels this way. To me, it always seemed she simply enjoyed wearing comfortable clothes, which is great! Girls need to see women wearing comfortable clothes and being ""allowed"" to wear comfortable clothes if they want to. I always felt like the ""Happier than ever period"" was a sad Billie trying very hard to look like Marilyn Monroe, but it came off like a costume, and kind of just made her look 30? I'm glad she is back to dressing in what seems to be closer to her comfy clothes style, if it makes her happy, but it's saddening to learn she wears clothes to ""troll"" people. I thought she wore those clothes to feel good, not to get a reaction. Free yourself of that unhealthy self consciousness, Billie! Their opinion isn't worth your discomfort.",https://www.reddit.com/r/billieeilish/comments/1525mw3/im_trolling_comment_billie_made_in_the_zane_lowe/,"""I'm trolling"" comment Billie made in the Zane Lowe interview?",billieeilish,t3_1525mw3,/r/billieeilish/comments/1525mw3/im_trolling_comment_billie_made_in_the_zane_lowe/,2023-07-17 15:48:39,Billie Eilish

[RS Interview](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/liv-e-girl-half-pearl-interview-1234668158/)

[Live and Quiet review](https://www.loudandquiet.com/reviews/liv-e-girl-in-the-half-pearl/)

press release:

&gt;LA-based, Dallas-raised artist Liv.e, announces her sophomore album 'Girl In The Half Pearl' due February 10th via In Real Life. 'Girl In The Half Pearl' seizes on both the creative and personal liberation Liv.e has experienced in the time since her 2020 debut album 'Couldn't Wait To Tell You...'. The album's 17 tracks are a document of self-examination, as she works through realizations prompted by grief and grapples with the dynamics of her role in the relationships in her life. Building upon the foundation she laid with CWTTY, 'Girl In The Half Pearl' bares her process of growth, forgiveness and reclamation of her sense of womanhood across an immersive soundscape. The album's artistic shifts developed during her time experimenting with live performance in London earlier this year while under residency at London's Laylow.

&gt;The 24-year-old artist first garnered attention with her 2017 EP, FRANK, and 2018's Hoopdreams EP. Over the past year, Liv.e shared the standalone Mndsgn-produced single ""Bout It,"" along with a COLORS performance and released 'CWTTY+', the deluxe version of her 2020 critically-acclaimed debut album. She's since performed alongside Earl Sweatshirt and Ravyn Lenae. Liv.e's unique sensibilities have also caught the eye of the fashion world, marked by an appearance in a Miu Miu ad campaign photographed by Tyrone Lebon. Most recently, she was featured on the new Mount Kimbie single titled ""a deities encore.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/10vjttd/live_is_releasing_her_sophomore_album_girl_in_the/,"Liv.e is releasing her sophomore album 'Girl In The Half Pearl' featuring production from Mndsgn, Aaron Liao, Solomonphonic, and John Carroll Kirby on February 10th",hiphopheads,t3_10vjttd,/r/hiphopheads/comments/10vjttd/live_is_releasing_her_sophomore_album_girl_in_the/,2023-02-06 22:10:48,Olivia Rodrigo

"Got back into taylor‚Äôs music this spring. I had a lot of catching up to do on reputation, lover, and midnights along with getting caught up in the nostalgia of her older music. All summer I was really into pop music so I knew I wouldn‚Äôt appreciate folklore and evermore as much as I should. I decided to wait until late summer to listen to folklore and love it. I‚Äôm glad I waited as I definitely wouldn‚Äôt have felt as emotionally connected to it in June lol. 

I told myself that I have to wait until the trees are yellow to listen to evermore. Yellow patches are starting to show so I give it a week or two before I listen. I just want it to be great. I‚Äôm down to go on a long drive and listen or sit at a park, whatever to make the experience great (i‚Äôm a taurus, i like to make all of my experiences special like this, okay!)

"I am just a casual listener so I may not know much details about these songs, maybe she's commented on them before, I don't know.

But like... It makes so much sense.

""Perfect all-American hair""

""I'm sexy and I'm kind""

""Got what you can't resist""

That's almost exactly what Lacy was about... About emotions for someone who seems to be perfect. But we don't know about the depth of her character and her imperfections.

In all-american B*tch, a similar girl appears to be the most flawless person ever, but she is burning from the inside. Her pain is invisible BECAUSE she aligns with the standards of perfection.

"Hi Tokkis &amp; Bunnies!!! We just wanted to make a poll regarding how the community feels about fan content being posted to the subreddit. We're growing along with the fandom and with NewJeans' popularity. Along with that comes the people who will use this subreddit to promote fan content whether it be someone else's or their very own. With that, we ask for your help in making decisions regarding them. The options are as follows:

**ALLOW** - Leave submissions as is. Let the posts come through as they are.

**ADJUST** - Change our ruling regarding fan content. We have some ideas regarding adjustment to them such as designating Fan Content to certain day(s) or requiring the OP to explicitly flair their post as ""Fan Content (OC)"" as a disclaimer to the community that's it's a self-promo post. We will also probably have another flair titled ""Fan Content (None OC)"" for fanart, covers, etc. OP submits but did not explicitly create.

"Curious to think what everyone thinks of the song. This is my opinion of course but the message and the heartbreak in the song mirrors the same story as her heartbreak in sour. The vibes of the song is also most similar to sour.

I don‚Äôt want to bring him up but I am pretty sure it is about her ex co star. They did break up in May and the lyrics is on theme with Sour who is about him, especially traitor. A tiktok came out on my fyp that pretty much confirms that he broke up with her on phone call on the 8th of May which was Friday. 

I‚Äôm just curious if she wrote this long ago and decided to release it now or if she‚Äôs her current self still reflecting on the heartbreak. It definitely adds a lot of layers!",https://www.reddit.com/r/OliviaRodrigo/comments/16ddeog/was_the_grudge_written_during_sour_era/,was the grudge written during sour era?,OliviaRodrigo,t3_16ddeog,/r/OliviaRodrigo/comments/16ddeog/was_the_grudge_written_during_sour_era/,2023-09-08 15:20:49,Olivia Rodrigo

I have a copy of Red RSD that I'm trying to figure out how to price. I originally purchased it sealed and found that it has a small dark streak from the manufacturing process (does not affect play). No hype sticker unfortunately, I threw it out (RIP). 

I checked Ebay and Discogs and cannot BELIEVE how much the value has skyrocketed.

"Love the new single, but does anyone else hear the high pitched buzzing in the vocal track of Vampire? It's most noticeable during the beginning when it's just her vocals and the piano, but I think it's around 17.4 kHz in frequency which is pretty high so idk how many people will notice it. I hear it in all versions of the song (stereo & dolby atmos, even in the YouTube music video), so I assume it'll probably be on the physical releases. I still find the song really enjoyable but I do wish this issue was caught before the song was finalized and released.

And also around 1:25 in the song there's a tiny click when she says the beginning of ""called"", but that's just me being nitpicky lol, it's not that bad.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OliviaRodrigo/comments/14mvag8/buzzing_noise_in_vampire/,Buzzing Noise in Vampire,OliviaRodrigo,t3_14mvag8,/r/OliviaRodrigo/comments/14mvag8/buzzing_noise_in_vampire/,2023-06-30 09:10:28,Olivia Rodrigo

"Posted every Monday for the following weekend. Use this post to find fellow Daydreamers to meet up with in Las Vegas! 

At the risk of sounding like an overbearing parent, your mods ask that you PLEASE use your own discretion when scheduling a meetup. Vegas is a very busy city with lots of wild characters. Tips to stay safe:

1. Meet in a public place.
2. Do not give out your hotel or room number.
3. Be cautious of who you add on some social media. Some social media (like Snapchat's Snapmap) can share your location to friends.
4. Always keep your drink(s) in your line-of-sight and don't take drinks (or anything else-- it's Vegas after all) from someone you just met, unless you see them get it from the bar.

"So she's released ""Love Story (Taylor's Version)"" and ""All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor's Version)"" as singles from Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version) \[the latter is a new song, but an extended version to an old one\]. 

If she were to continue releasing one rerecorded song as a single to accompany her upcoming rerecorded albums, what would they be? My guesses would be:

* Speak Now (Taylor's Version) ‚Äì ""**Enchanted (Taylor's Version)**""  
The fact that we've potentially heard a snippet of this in her dancer's IG story kind of confirms that this will be the rerecording she will release as a single next. This may not be intentional, but she'd always eventually release songs that have ""leaked"" (e.g.. All the Girls You Loved Before), so this might be apt.
* 1989 (Taylor's Version) - ""**All You Had to Do Was Stay (Taylor's Version)**""  
I know that we've been given ""This Love (Taylor's Version) and ""Wildest Dreams (Taylor's Version)"" ahead of this album's release, but something tells me this could be the ""official"" rerecorded single release to accompany the album's release, probably also in tandem with her breakup with Joe. This song is also the highest streams from 1989 outside of singles (and a bop).
* Reputation (Taylor's Version) - ""**Getaway Car (Taylor's Version)**""  
This is a fan favourite song, so this could act as both a service to fans and also a continuation of her breakup with Joe.
* Taylor Swift (Taylor's Version) - ""**Picture to Burn (Taylor's Version)**""  
Maybe I'm reading too much into the breakup angle, but this would end the saga. If by then she's started dating someone new, would be nice to hear ""Mary's Song (Oh My My My) (Taylor's Version)"" as a single too.

I also think (or maybe hope) she'll record and release her covers of ""Drops of Jupiter"" and ""Can't Stop Loving You"" as singles From the Vault ahead of Speak Now (Taylor's Version) and Reputation (Taylor's Version), because of popular demand.

Oh, and this is the order I think her upcoming rerecordings will be released.

"Obviously this sub is dedicated to NewJeans, so most of the responses will be positive, but I'd still like to hear them.

I have never had absolutely any interest in K-Pop. It's always been one of those facets of the internet that I know exists, but don't interact with. I've tried before, but the videos I found always looked very unappealing and unapproachable. The girls had this professional 'girl boss' vibe that didn't make me interested in seeing them do anything other than sing, and the guys had a stoic boring model look that also didn't make me interested in them. I know that when you get into the meat of things they all goof off in their own way and have their funny moments, but that's not the first impression.

However, last month I learnt of the existence of NewJeans, which was a huge contrast to what I had seen of K-Pop before. Five girls filled with energy with an aura that made them feel approachable and easy to digest, which is obviously majorly fabricated by the corporate and marketing side of things, but that's a different conversation. Their music is fun, the videos outside of music are entertaining and never feel heavy; It's just the sort of thing that I enjoy watching after I finish work and I'm just scrolling mindlessly through YouTube looking for something to fill the silence. I'm sure the fact that I am just about the same age as the oldest member in the group, which makes it so I relate to them a lot more, also adds to why I've been enjoying their content.

I still haven't gotten to the point where I'm interested in other groups, but after watching probably 12 hours of content of NewJeans and adding some of their songs to my playlists, I can't lie to myself and keep saying that I am not into K-Pop.

"Hi all,

As I‚Äôm sure many regular users of this subreddit have noticed, there has been a significant increase in what we call ‚Äúship wars‚Äù over the past few months. To be clear, we are not saying that posting about Dianna or Karlie is starting a ship war, because it‚Äôs not. 

There are two users who create repeated accounts that essentially proselytize the belief that Dianna is ‚Äúthe one true muse‚Äù for Taylor. There is another user who creates repeated accounts doing the same for Karlie. These users actively seek to rile up other users, either to sway them towards or away from certain muses. The way they do this is different than normal users debating or discussing various theories and thoughts - they abrasive, aggressive, hostile, ingratiating, deceptive, and they turn almost every post they comment on into a less pleasant place to be if you‚Äôre not aligned with their belief system. The conversation for other users - particularly newer gaylors - is shut down and/or becomes filled with theories that have been twisted into knots in order to fit a particular narrative. As a mod team, we have found that it is the users of this subreddit who are best able to identify and report these users to the mod team. We actually rely upon users to help identify people so that we can then watch and observe to see if their reports check out.

The ‚Äùship wars‚Äù are designed to perpetuate several ideologies, but 2 of the most prevalent are:

* that Dianna is ‚Äúthe one true muse‚Äù and that Karlie was irrelevant
* that Karlie is ‚Äúthe one true muse‚Äù and that Dianna was irrelevant 

It is my opinion - and I believe it is the opinion of the majority of gaylors on this subreddit - that both of these views are flawed and inherently divisive. My personal belief is that there is not ‚Äúone true muse‚Äù, but rather that there are many muses and that (like many of us) Taylor has had several great loves. If I had to guess, I would say that we as outsiders are entirely unaware of some of those loves and lovers. 

As a mod team, we are curious if you have suggestions for ways to address this issue or to help negate the ways that ‚Äúship wars‚Äù can fully shut down conversations.

Thanks in advance!",https://www.reddit.com/r/GaylorSwift/comments/18t6awd/any_user_suggestions_to_address_ship_war_issues/,Any user suggestions to address ‚Äúship war‚Äù issues?,GaylorSwift,t3_18t6awd,/r/GaylorSwift/comments/18t6awd/any_user_suggestions_to_address_ship_war_issues/,2023-12-28 22:19:08,Taylor Swift

In Asian culture the 5 elements are metal, water, wood, fire, and earth (soil).


I think for the western elements: 


Dani - Earth - Nature, Mother Earth vibes, seems like a fairy/pixie that would live in the forest.

Haerin - Ether - Ethereal, quiet (no sound in space :p), out there, 4D

Hanni - Fire - passionate, emotional, loud, enthusiastic.

Minji - Water - Chill, calm, go with the flow, can be still and relaxing or extremely powerful and strong depending on the tide.

Hyein - Air - very malleable, flows through, cannot be contained.



What do y‚Äôall think / what about the Asian elements?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NewJeans/comments/163fas4/newjeans_as_elements/,NewJeans as Elements,NewJeans,t3_163fas4,/r/NewJeans/comments/163fas4/newjeans_as_elements/,2023-08-28 07:24:43,New Jeans

" I‚Äôm so sad.  I ordered an Olivia Rodrigo vinyl from an online site that seemed cool called Spatula city records. I had ordered midnights and a Lana record from them and they came fine. 

My Sour vinyl came totally ruined. Clearly had been opened and taped back up when it was supposed to be sealed and the black scratched record was put in this album which doesn‚Äôt match since only turquoise / pink versions came in the exclusive album art cover. 

The store owner is adamant that they packed up and shipped out a sealed turquoise record and doesn‚Äôt seem to want to refund me or do anything about it because he can‚Äôt control what happens during shipping. I‚Äôm sure he thinks I swapped them and am trying to scam him or something. I just never would‚Äôve imagined something like this could happen.

"I unfortunately did not get Sour tour tickets, so this time I was on it. I learned from watching the swifties fight for eras. I got lucky and had a friend who got Amex presale, got in with their group, got a ticket for $100. 

Unfortunately this was not the person who I had planned to go with, so I still wanted to try for the general sale with her and would sell the previous ticket if I could go with her. No code, oh well. Then a friend of mine who I got an Amex ticket with did get a code for today! I decide to use it, just to look, lo and behold it was for the second date at our spot. I got lucky AGAIN and got another $100 ticket with the friend I intended to go with for a different show date. That means I can go to TWO SHOWS SINCE ITS FOR THE SECOND DATE.

I don‚Äôt feel the need to sell since I had originally planned to spend about $200 on one ticket, so I had budgeted it well. Also it‚Äôs a good just in case because I don‚Äôt know if my other friend is reliable to see the show with since she lives in another state, so i can still see the show if she cancels.

I had a friend who meant alot to me. We met for the first time in 2020 and quickly became good friends. We would talk everyday, about anything. But one day we got into a fight, and that was the end of our friendship. It happened last year and it still affects me today. When I check her social media, I can see her having a good time.

" 

Looking at the music video now, I feel like it shows Taylor's wish to move away from this private relationship inside four walls, and have a more public and exciting relationship.

The music video start with her and the guy laying in bed, she's being awake and him laying faced away from him. She seems melancholic with a cloud over her head, looing for some excitement in the bedroom. The haze fills the room, and she is dancing alone away from him, crawling up to the TV in a field of lavender. She also sits alone on a couch looking very rebellious, smoking. She seems to want to be more rebellious that just sit at home alone on the couch. Then she is in this purple water, maybe signalling some sort of rebirth? Then, she is in a room full of people, very publically flirting with her man with a party going on around her, and she seems much happier than she was at the start of the video. The video ends with her pushing away the walls of the bedroom, signalling she is tired of keeping her relationship private behind the four walls, and is ready to move on to something new. There is also the koi fish, signalling Spark Now TV. And she announces Spark Now at the same time as she is announcing a new relationship.

This just seems very planned out to me to be a coincidence. Before the lavender haze music video, she posted the bejeweled music video, which is basically her saying she has been too nice, he has not paid enough attention to her and put her in the basement. She is tired of it and need to go out and shimmer in public again. Then she posts the lavender haze video where she shows she is bored of the private relationship and needs to have fun again, with a more public and messy relationship. Which is exactly what she is doing now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/13guk65/revisiting_the_lavender_haze_music_video/,Revisiting the lavender haze music video,TaylorSwift,t3_13guk65,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/13guk65/revisiting_the_lavender_haze_music_video/,2023-05-13 22:21:43,Taylor Swift

"The release of the deluxe Speak Now version with live recordings just made me realize this is possible ü§Ø She also confirmed she is willing to perform some surprise songs again after messing them up like DBATC.
 
Each fan who went to the tour could relive at least one exact song from the day of the concert; could hear a live version of her/his favorite song even if it was not played that night.
Each fan who could not go could would get to relive this.

Some questions for you:

- How likely do you think this is?
- Do you think this kind of release could see her get the top 10 of the Billboard 100 with enough marketing & intensive to buy week one?
- Or do you think a ""best of live"" kind of album is more realistic?
- Was this talked about before? Maybe it has & everyone knows this is a theory & I'm outof the loop.

I'm interested in reading your comments about this!

Issues I could see:

- for some songs she is really running around a lot and we would hear more the backup singers than her => they could easily have a team selecting the best performed night over the whole tour for each song. And most surprise songs are played acoustic so are less problematic I think.
- some songs have featuring artists we've not seen yet on tour with her and they might not make it => but she's already played some of them anyway, like Snow on the beach in Vegas

Here are some details I thought about:

- The collection could be subtitle ""The eras"" with ""(The Era's Tour version)(From City)"" added at the end of each song. Imagine ATWTMVFTVTETVFLA.
- She's already released a live album but it's still not owned by her (there is also LPSS but it's not with fans)
- this would be such an awesome way to thank fans, reward them and really close out the tour nicely, to ease moving on to another era
- she could also release only one big live album with all the songs, including ones like IDWLF. This would have insane streaming numbers and could have more longevity in the charts...
- Maybe even... Dare I dream... Blueray discs? Or 10 netflix specials, 1 for each album? ü§°

And some stats to back up this possibility:

Album | Approx. number of songs
:-- | --:
Taylor Swift (-1 TOMG+6 vault) | 20
Fearless TV | 26
Speak Now TV	| 22
Red TV (-1 SOG twice) | 29
1989 (deluxe+6 vault) | 22
Reputation (+6 vault) | 21
Lover	| 18
Folklore	| 17
Evermore	| 17
Midnights	| 23

This means:

Data | ()
 :-- | --:
Approx. total songs | 215
Cities | 47
Concerts  | 131
Songs from the setlist (played multiple times) | 44
Surprise songs possible | 262
Concerts played to date | 41
Surprise songs played to date | 82

This would even leave some room for some surprise Christmas songs if there really are no repeat surprise songs ü§° the leftover ones would be from Midnight album.

"Of course it can be both or even some combination with other reasons, but if you had to choose one that you encounter more:

Do you think that Hetlors remain Hetlors because they are your run of the mill homophobes, or do Hetlors remain Hetlors because they have some type of unhealthy parasocial attachment to her and like, couldn't possibly believe that ""Mother"" could ""lie"" to them for all these years? 

Curious to know your impression. I'm a new fan of hers (since maybe spring/early summer of 2023), and right when I learned about Gaylor/Bilor (early August), I was like ""Yup, sold, undeniable"", so I haven't spent much time in the general Swiftie spaces/communities.

Bonus question, do you think it's possible for someone to genuinely think that ""Taylor could/would never lie to her fans, the general public"" without some sort of unhealthy parasocial attachment to her? To me, someone who believes this is either naive about the entertainment industry and how it works/has worked for years now, or they have kind of like.. drunk the Taylor flavored Koolaid. (Idk, I'm trying not to sound disrespectful, but I don't know how else to get that idea across lol) Is there any in-between on this? Honestly, the parasocial element icks me out, but I guess I can get it.. the woman knows how to write music and brand herself well, and she's been doing it for a long time. 

I think these topics/questions have been on my mind because I feel like as a new fan, I've been thrown into such a huge fandom with so much lore, etc and it's a lot to take in and process. I'm also thinking about it when I consider the future of Taylor's career and music and what fans can expect or hope to see/hear from her and how we/they might respond to her future releases, announcements, etc.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Gaylor_Swift/comments/15wy7ne/is_it_homophobia_or_is_it_some_type_of_unhealthy/,Is it homophobia or is it some type of unhealthy parasocial thing?,Gaylor_Swift,t3_15wy7ne,/r/Gaylor_Swift/comments/15wy7ne/is_it_homophobia_or_is_it_some_type_of_unhealthy/,2023-08-21 05:26:03,Taylor Swift

My week I brought a tiny hand written paper that simply said,"" It was a dream come true to be here and thank you,"" had it in my Adele bag, nothing serious and security, who was digging through everyone's bag telling them to rubber band their posters saw it and asked, "" What was the point of showing this sign? Hoping for a hug or to get her attention?"" took the paper, ripped it, and said Adele doesn't like that kind of stuff, people holding signs, and how fans don't know her, then tried to soften it by saying she does love sparkles (my dress has sparkles). When I mentioned these things are at other weekends I've seen, the security lady said don't listen to what you see on social media implying that it is not happening (They are on Adele's actual post!).

"I did not have another round of Eras Tour dates in late 2024 on my "" Taylor does crazy shit"" bingo card. I am glad Swifties will get another chance to get tickets but the dates are puzzling.

The only time Taylor missed a two year album release cycle (excluding the rerecords) was in 2016 and when she surprise dropped Evermore in 2020. I would have bet money on a new album in October or early November 2024 after Eras ended in London in August and before Mariah Carey season.

Now we have Eras ending at the end of November so there are only three options. Either Taylor drops a new album while the tour is still happening, she dukes it out with the Queen of Christmas or TS11 is not happening in 2024.

We know Taylor is spending a lot of time in the studio so something is cooking. It could be the re-recordings but she has been working on that for quite a while now so is there really that much left to do?

Foolishly I thought I had a pretty good idea what we have to look forward to and now all my assumptions have been proved wrong.

"Have you listened to it in full lately? What do you think of it?

I think there are some welcome interpretations of Taylor¬¥s songs in there, but it also feels like he didn't really trust the material, and ended up with something quite derivative, instead of an homage. I mean, there wasn't any need to change the melodies, when writing a good melody is one of Taylor's greatest talents.

edit: found out he not only has no artistic merit or discernible musical identity, he's also a creep, so you're better off ignoring this truly mediocre album",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/11zofy7/1989_ryan_adams_version/,1989 (Ryan Adams' Version),TaylorSwift,t3_11zofy7,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/11zofy7/1989_ryan_adams_version/,2023-03-23 15:50:44,Taylor Swift

"I have been getting back into kpop this year and listening to some 4th gen groups. I liked a couple of New Jeans early songs. And though I didn‚Äôt really vibe with Get Up, I wanted to check out [some of their recent stages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGhugk1FsXo) because they‚Äôre obviously very popular.  
But man are they boring to watch on stage. I find their delivery to be very flat and monotonous and they even often look bored themselves. Their dancing is okay. They are executing all the moves, but it all feels robotic. I‚Äôm really surprised because I‚Äôve seen people say their dancing is hip hop style??? but it doesn‚Äôt have any swag or groove.

I think part of it is that the music is subdued. I checked out some stages for their faster songs from the recent album and it's a little better but I still get the same bored feeling. (Though I will say there is one girl who stands out more than the rest. But I don't know her name.) I guess this is intentional on their part, to be anti kpop‚Äôs bombastic tendencies. But boy, the lack of expression in conjunction with the monotonous music‚Ä¶   
I can‚Äôt help but compare it to some other groups (chill please, seriously please relax) who performed on that same show. Like [XG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEpkcHbcZUQ) who felt so natural and smooth like they were having genuine fun up there. I really see the hip hop influence and style. Or [Itzy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNLHYFxhO0U) still has a lot of charisma even during the simple parts of their choreo (on second watch mainly Ryujin maybe??). These groups are full of expression whether the choreo is complicated (XG) or simpler (Itzy).  
Although, I will say that it‚Äôs not just New Jeans. I have felt this way about other popular 4th Gen girl groups‚Äô dancing. But in those cases the music was able to carry a bit.

"I‚Äôm in Vegas and saw The Beatles Love show on Friday and saw Adele last night. Both shows were spectacular.

What was not spectacular was peoples behaviors at both shows. 

At Adele, I was in section 106 and the people in front of us were FaceTiming people during the show, texting and having their own conversations the entire time. 

Not only is it disruptive to others around you, I can‚Äôt believe people would pay hundreds and thousands of dollars for a once in a lifetime show, to act this way. 

I wasn‚Äôt going to let these people ruin my time there and I had an amazing time regardless. I wish people who were actually invested in the performance had gotten those seats in front of us instead of people who couldn‚Äôt give a shit.

If you‚Äôre going to Adele or any show for that matter, show some respect for other concert goers. Enjoy yourself but be mindful that people have spent a lot of money and time to make it here. And don‚Äôt act like an ass!

I love the production for ""so here's to everything...COMING DOWN TO NOTHING..Here's to silence"", when it just completely cuts off music for ""coming down to nothing"" and you hear drums in the background, then it's ironically back on for 'here's to silence'...ANYWAY.



A little thing I hate is the weird voice at the start of georgous, thank god it's only there at the start. And just one word. This is a song I love so much so I'm glad it wasn't fully ruined. Same goes to getaway car at the start. Why did we need that? It doesn't ruin the song the same way that midnight rain is ruined by the full chorus being this way, (I only listen to an edited version on youtube with her normal voice because it's such a good song) but it's something I hate. You can tell I hate autotune lmao 

But yeah what are some small things that you love/hate in her songs?",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/15smckq/what_are_little_things_you_absolutely_lovehate/,What are little things you absolutely love/hate about some of her songs?,TaylorSwift,t3_15smckq,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/15smckq/what_are_little_things_you_absolutely_lovehate/,2023-08-16 10:43:51,Taylor Swift

"Posted every Monday for the following weekend. Use this post to find fellow Daydreamers to meet up with in Las Vegas! 

At the risk of sounding like an overbearing parent, your mods ask that you PLEASE use your own discretion when scheduling a meetup. Vegas is a very busy city with lots of wild characters. Tips to stay safe:

1. Meet in a public place.
2. Do not give out your hotel or room number.
3. Be cautious of who you add on some social media. Some social media (like Snapchat's Snapmap) can share your location to friends.
4. Always keep your drink(s) in your line-of-sight and don't take drinks (or anything else-- it's Vegas after all) from someone you just met, unless you see them get it from the bar.

We hope to see r/Adele Daydreamers make lifelong friends at these concerts! Have fun and be safe!

For some reason, I decided to put 1989 on shuffle yesterday when I was on the bus going to school, and I honestly don't know why I never liked it. I wouldn't go so far to say it's my favorite, but it definitely ranks a lot higher than 10th place now, and I am less inclined to say the whole album is overrated now.

I reordered most of the songs. I kept the first couple songs because they are punchy and ironic but wanted to keep that energy just a little longer so I moved up Ballad. I then wanted to transition into something more contemplative so I moved the slower songs into the middle and arranged them after Ballad into Pretty showing the world is already stacked against her. And her reaction is to turn to Lacy. But it just leads to more her trauma which she feels responsible for in Bed and her unwillingness to forgive her wrong-doers in Grudge. Then transitioning from melancholy upping the energy Vampire does a really good job of connecting those two because it reinforces her grudge. She‚Äôs kind of Embarrassed and vengeful. But ultimately realizing it wasn‚Äôt meant to be a Teenage Dream. I also made sure that the songs still transition nicely into the next.,https://i.redd.it/2svu0rkp4vnb1.jpg,Something about the order of the track list was off‚Ä¶,OliviaRodrigo,t3_16gy1xe,/r/OliviaRodrigo/comments/16gy1xe/something_about_the_order_of_the_track_list_was/,2023-09-12 17:51:47,Olivia Rodrigo

"I only started following NewJeans last month but I already know all their names, songs, background, it's crazy. The last time I got so invested in an artist was BTS during the Blood Sweat and Tears era. But NewJeans so far has achieved a few things that even BTS hasn't, and I've never seen a group grow this quickly before. Of course I'm sure the growth is partly due to TikTok and other internet developments that weren't there before, but still!

My friends and I made a small anaylsis video about this topic:  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkNXdUKuG8s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkNXdUKuG8s)

But if you'd prefer to read, here's the gist of it:

\------------------

\- For an artist, it's not always enough to just have skill, talent, looks, etc. Sometimes the most important thing is telling a story. NewJeans might have debuted out of the blue, but they managed to tell a story.

\- The concept for the Ditto MV and even the song itself is *universal.* Everyone no matter the age or gender will be able to relate to it. And it's such a great idea to not just include the Y2K aesthetic but actually shoot a video that's supposed to be set in the past, because it also has an added element of nostalgia for adults who would be reminded of their school days.

\- The twist that came with the OMG MV (Danielle insisting that they're an idol group called NewJeans while being in a psychiatric facility) tied in all their previous music videos in a really interesting way. Ditto + OMG together are edited like a psychological thriller (which honestly I don't remember seeing from any other artist, let alone executed so well - let me know if I'm wrong).

\- Starting with ""innocent"" videos like Attention and Hype Boy and leading us all the way here makes a great album rollout, the likes of which we haven't seen in a long time.

\- The existence of NewJeans lore (thanks to the Ban Hee Soo channel), which not just feeds the background of the music videos but also caters to an audience which actually loves lore.

\- Most importantly, the way the Ditto MVs are shot and the choreography for Ditto and OMG are casual and ""sloppy"" in a way that other artists don't dare to be. But maybe that's exactly what this generation is looking for - plain old authenticity.

\- Bonus: There's no favoritism in NewJeans; one member isn't constantly highlighted over the others, and everyone seems to get equal screen time.

\------------------

My boyfriend ordered me the Folklore film crewneck (on November 24th) for christmas from the UK store and still hasn‚Äôt received a shipping email.

Basically, the chart expert took a close look at NewJeans data such as album sales, each song's number of unique listeners domestically, global streaming for the first 30 days etc...quick comparison with other current girlgroups and gave out his prediction for their next comeback.

He pointed out that NewJeans' data trend is very different than all the other groups, and their songs' longevity in number of unique listeners are not like others.

For his conclusion:

1. He said with 100% confidence that NewJeans' initial album sales for the next comeback will certainly exceed 1 million.
2. It remains to be seen for the next comeback if NewJeans global streaming for the first 30 days could exceed 10 millions which only Blackpink has been able to achieve so far.
3. Now is the time for NewJean's individual recognition to be increased through marketing, to give more exposure to each of the members to the public to increase their individual popularity since as a group, their music is already well known by the public.
4. If NewJeans could keep up the momentum, they will reach Blackpink's level of popularity that took Blackpink 4-5 years in a much shorter time.

The expert also has some other interesting videos analyzing data from Kpop groups, you can go to his channel for more info.

Of course these data only scratch the surface of everything that's going on, but these are indicators that what NewJeans has been doing all work well so far. Apparently, what NewJeans has been doing lately (brand ambassadorships for each member, group commercials with well known brands like McDonald's, LG, Nike etc...) is the correct move.",https://www.reddit.com/r/NewJeans/comments/11enrfm/a_look_at_the_growth_process_of_newjeans_by_korea/,A look at the growth process of NewJeans by Korea Music Content Association,NewJeans,t3_11enrfm,/r/NewJeans/comments/11enrfm/a_look_at_the_growth_process_of_newjeans_by_korea/,2023-02-28 23:37:43,New Jeans

"FINALLY got my hands on some Polaroid &amp; kiss mark confetti at the show!! I thankfully met a friend here on our Reddit thread that sent me an extra one they had from their show, but I was so happy to be able to grab some more 
If you are worried about it, hopefully you will have a chance to grab it- the ushers we‚Äôre collecting it in small white baskets and standing at the entrance of the doors to the theater on the first floor 
This didn‚Äôt happen at the first show we attended (back on 12/23) but thankfully it did the second time we went (2/25) 
We were up on the 4th floor and my mom was on a confetti hunt for me because she knew I was desperate for it lol, however the ushers on the 2nd floor completely brushed her off when she asked to go in and get some 
When we got to the 1st floor they were letting everyone come up and grab them from the baskets!! 
Be wary though-it‚Äôs a ZOO once people figure out that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening 
A little pro tip- go all the way down to the end door furthest away from the front of the actual colosseum entrance, that‚Äôs where we were able to grab HANDFULS of confetti and I was crying I was so happy!! If you are up on the 3rd &amp; 4th floor she does have confetti that falls during love is a game right on top of you, its not Polaroid or the kiss mark/ message confetti but at least it‚Äôs a little souvenir!!

"I swear to God I'm not at all a kpop fan but there's just really something different to New Jeans üëñ‚ú®. 

Before New Jeans, I know I was dealing with certain addictions and loneliness for sure and I know I was really doing my best to recover but I really didn't know where to start or how to start. But encountering New Jeans (thanks to my sis who's also a Bunny), I've realized that I seriously needed to invest on myself and my relationship with people, especially my friends. I thought what I was missing in life was having a boyfriend, to really move on from my ex (I know, it sounds really pathetic) but because of New Jeans, I didn't know what I lacked was really stepping into self-expression and self love, valuing my femininity (you know, since I am still a young adult woman) having more, not taking life too seriously, and most of all investing in my female friendships. I didn't know that I yearned having kind of like a girl group of my own, I didn't know that as women, we need other women to back us up through difficult moments... And I think New Jeans has that good influence on girls coming to age. So yeah, that's my two pence on New Jeans.

"Do you guys also think as I am?? New Jeans '1st EP New Jeans' is a massive original hit with all nice songs. Also, ditto and OMG proved that NJ is completely different from other K-pop; they are in a new era/level. But its second album is utterly poor. Super shy? It has a catchy chorus but the verse is so terrible that I couldn't even want to listen to it for the second time. Other songs- ETA, ASAP, Cool with You, get up, and new jeans are also equally awful. The music is bad, lyrics are second-class. Also what with those beats? I know HYBE could do better for those. In conclusion, I'm very disappointed with the second album.

"#Background

Following the Manchester Arena bombing during her Dangerous Woman Tour in May 2017, ""No Tears Left to Cry"" was the first song Grande wrote for her ""Sweetener"" album with Max Martin, Ilya and Savan Kotecha for Sweetener, after working with Pharrell Williams for most of the album. She wanted her first single since the bombing to be hopeful and touch on the incident, but not dwell on it.The song came about when Grande said, ""I want it to be positive and talk about positivity and love. I don't have any tears left to cry."" Ariana intended for ""No Tears Left to Cry"" to bridge a change in sound from her previous album  by being more obscure and unexpected, inspired by her work with Pharell, and thus suggested its verses and chorus to be in different keys. Kotecha cited Lauryn Hill's' The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill and En Vogue's ""Don't Let Go (Love)"" as inspiration for the track's chord change.

#Release & reception

The song debuted and peaked at #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 with over 100,000 copies sold on its first week. It received universal acclaim from critics upon release, with critics praising her musical evolution, vocal skills, and overall buoyancy that helped bring brevity to such a devastating terrorist attack. It has also had a bit of re-evaluation in some circles after the release of the album proper coincided with Mac Miller's death and her break-up with Pete Davidson as an artificial mask of happiness that hid a deep sorrow compounded by a now-deleted tweet from Ariana where she stated that she did, in fact, have plenty of tears left to cry. Nevertheless, the song has been cemented as a 2010s pop staple and one of her very best songs to date.

#Personal thoughts

I loved the song from the very first day it released, and it has only gotten better and better with age. I was devastated for Ariana after the Manchester attack and this was the perfect song to hear at the time. The choir singing the chord progression at the beginning of the video, the ""pickin' it up, pickin' it up"" lines at the end of the choruses, the introduction of the iconic ""yuh"", the utterly gorgeous & surreal video that honestly might be her best to date. It was a perfect introduction to the Sweetener era and it holds a special place in my heart. This song (and by extension the entirety of the Sweetener era), is the moment where Ariana became a true artist in her own right and not just a pop singer.

#Questions

1. What were your thoughts on the song when it was released? Have your thoughts changed on it in the past five years?
2. Do you believe that the song is sadder than it appears on the surface?
3. Do you believe that this was the moment where Ariana became a ""real artist""? Why or why not?
4.

"What do y'all think will be BE3 main theme and message? With red being basically the main assumption of color for this album, I think it'll be pretty intense, sexy and dark (in the literal sense, I expect some MVS, like NDA, recorded during night), and pretty personal (as she already said before), so I think there will definitely be songs with lyrics about her career so far, fans obsession over her past relationships, etc. And I think it'll make us revisit all past eras, just as she did in the Barbie MV.

For the main genre, I think it'll be kinda of mixed? Not 100% rock as people are saying, I don't think Billie would get rid of her pop vibes (she can though). It may be kinda of an alt-rock, just as AM from Artic Monkeys.",https://www.reddit.com/r/billieeilish/comments/17wvvqq/be3_main_theme/,BE3 main theme,billieeilish,t3_17wvvqq,/r/billieeilish/comments/17wvvqq/be3_main_theme/,2023-11-16 19:58:02,Billie Eilish
"Haerin, the most popular member of Newjeans in China, sadly lost her biggest fansite account because the fansite admin scammed fans. Even though the money was returned (as I read but not too sure), it was too late, and people began criticizing the account. New fansite accounts were created for Haerin, but the followers for the old one peaked at 167,000 and sadly are now inactive. Hanni's biggest fanbase also closed due to similar issues, with 86,000 followers before shutting down. Danielle old fansite has 86,000 followers too before it inactive.

&#x200B;

Now, their new fansite followers are 38,000 for Hanni and 16,000 for Haerin. Danielle new fansite followers are 12,000. It's such a huge loss, to be honest.

That song is standing out as a repeat for me and I think it would make such a great music video.

10. bad idea right? (5/10)
11. lacy (4/10)
12. all-american b!tch (3/10)

Overall the rating for all the songs are 6/10. I don't believe that's actually the rating of the album. I would say it varies between 6 and 7, out of 10.

I think one of the best things about Olivia is how well she transpires her feelings into her songs. You feel them in her voice and in her lyrics. It's a fun album, just like her first one. 

It's also pretty solid, all the songs feel like a very safe net for her, but they also have tons of personality that never allows them to be dull. She perfectly embolds the ""teen spirit"". In that way, she kinda reminds me of Avril Lavigne. 

She is a great artist in the making. Pop is great, and she brings good brand new songs to the genre!

I do like the first one better, I think the more ""punk"" songs were more enjoyable, but GUTS is a great and consistent follow up from her last album.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OliviaRodrigo/comments/16eadel/guts_my_rating_ranking/,GUTS: my rating & ranking,OliviaRodrigo,t3_16eadel,/r/OliviaRodrigo/comments/16eadel/guts_my_rating_ranking/,2023-09-09 16:44:16,Olivia Rodrigo

"Originally posted to r/popheads but got removed by mods for being a ‚Äústale topic‚Äù.

I‚Äôm not going to bother with backstory or say ‚Äúshe‚Äôs broken such-and-such records‚Äù in the introductory paragraph because we all know who she is [this is even more the case in the Taylor sub lol]

If she isn‚Äôt there already, she is clearly well on her way to legend status; I really don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs disputable at this point. One may dislike her music, but you cannot deny her massive commercial success and impact on American popular culture in an era where a monoculture does not really exist.

* She is the only artist in the past decade (since 2013) to have sold a million first week in pure sales in the US with a new album, outside of Adele.

* Only artist ever to occupy the whole Billboard Hot 100 top ten simultaneously.

* I‚Äôve never seen anything quite like what‚Äôs happening with the Eras Tour. Not only the sheer demand, but we‚Äôve also seen things like not only getting the key to the city, but also stadiums (Houston), to entire counties (Hillsborough County, FL) have been temporarily renamed. It honestly sounds like Michael Jackson-type enthusiasm. Everyone in a given city seems genuinely happy to have her there. Maybe some of this type of stuff is for PR, but if so, it‚Äôs damn good.

My question is: has she done enough to have earned a sort of ‚Äúpermanent seat at the table‚Äù, as I have seen argued for her contemporaries Lady Gaga and Beyonc√© (ie. Will she hold an unimpeachable place in the American musical canon in the decades to come)? Will she be remembered with the legends from the older generation like McCartney, Elton John, Cher, etc.?

" And the tennis court was covered up with some tent-like thing. An analysis. 

There are multiple interpretations for this line, which is the beginning line of ‚ÄúCowboy Like Me‚Äù. My first interpretation of this line was that a bagworm or tent caterpillar colony has infested the tennis court, covering it up with their cocoons, which sometimes do resemble tents. Bagworm infestations are a problem in many areas of the world, and they could have conceivably covered a tennis court. Here is a problem though: tent caterpillar coverings are unwanted nuisances, and a well-maintained tennis court would probably not have them. 

Another possible interpretation is a tennis court tarp. This structure is placed over the tennis court to protect it from rain or other inclement weather. This is also likely considering this happens with real tennis courts, and some tennis court tarps also resemble tents when they are pulled up. Fabric sports structures could also be used for the same reason, and with the same visual resemblance. They tend to be expensive, which also fits for the ‚Äúswindling the rich guys‚Äù theme of ‚ÄúCowboy Like Me‚Äù. I believe this is more likely than the tent caterpillar interpretation. 

So what do you think? Are there other possibilities that I missed?

these are short summaries of the ones I've heard so far ( ask me if u wanna know more abt any of these theories plz!):  


\- heeso is a newjeans fan and keeps imagining they are with her to help her overcome her pain :')

\- they were in an accident with a deer and heeso has survivors guilt so she imagines they are still with her ( explains the cast on her arm )

  
 \- it started raining and heeso walked home since she had an umbrella. NWJNS waited for a car and got into an accident with a deer :/

\- NWJNS got into an accident and Hanni is the only one that survived so she changed schools and her name to ""heeso"". (this explains why she's the only one with a black suit and acts differently during the MV and the camera glitches )

  
\- same as first but Hanni is heeso's bias which explains the glitches when Hanni is on screen and why she acts differently.

"*Your eyes whispered, ‚ÄúHave we met?‚Äù*


There are judgmental stares. There are stares that happen when someone zones out. And there are stares of remembrance. Sometimes you can tell which emotion is running through the head of the person staring at you. 


Taylor could tell from the look in the muse‚Äôs eyes, that they were trying to place her face to a memory. Taylor makes it clear that they had indeed *not* met. Maybe they had seen Taylor in a dream. Maybe they had conjured up face like hers when imagining their future soulmate, and that‚Äôs why she looked familiar. I love how Taylor described their eyes as gentle and ethereal without saying gentle or ethereal - instead, she says their eyes whispered.

"i just listened to flowers by miley cyrus yesterday and fell in love with it.!! <3 what a great song!

could hear the ace of bass right away, but wasn't aware of the bruno mars until today. and it's also pretty much the progression of I will Survive / Fly me to the Moon / Gonna fly now.

but either way. i love it! so much! :)

i just downloaded the entire Endless Summer Vacation album and i was a bit disappointed. can't say im a fan of any of the other songs. i don't really know any of her other work very well. i think i like the cannon ball song. oh wait. or wrecking ball. but yeah. i guess, besides these two songs, i don't really know any of her stuff. but i know i'm not really into the rest of the songs on this album.

are there any more of her songs by her that are like flowers. I suppose in the same style as this one, but also quality?

"There's this club. Perhaps you've visited it a few times before, or maybe this is your first time. Whether it's a strip club, or a burlesque show, a fetish club, or a brothel... well, all are possible, and maybe it doesn't matter too much... It's off the main club area, almost hidden away. You'd go right past it if you didn't know to look for it.

For someone with either the right money, or the right contacts, the bartender might offer the customer a look at their ""special menu"". If they're interested, you know? The leather bound folder with photographs, and an intriguing menu of ""activities"". And perhaps you might even be able to meet, for a sum, the owner of the bar. She's on the last page of the booklet. The biggest sum - although of course it isn't about the money of course, that just adds the appropriate frisson.

And who is the owner? The last page, the photos, naked flesh exposed. Tied. Maybe blindfolded. Just referred to as ""B"" on the page.

Surely that's not... Billie Eilish, is it? \*\*

If you're interested, drop me a line and we can chat, see if it takes off.

Hoping to find a fun and creative roleplay experience. I enjoy the process of writing and greatly prefer scenes where both parties enjoy exploring and enjoying the fantasy as it develops. I like to leave room for growth in a scene, rather than defining every tiny detail in advance, and also appreciate a sense of humour; after all this is meant to be fun, not a job! And as a fantasy, it doesn‚Äôt need to stick to being too realistic.

Major things for this scene would be breast and nipple play, including bondage, toys/insertions, writing, names, degradation, that sort of mischief, and getting in way over my head.

Limits: Watersports (and things of that nature), ageplay (all characters and participants must be 18+ of course), non-consent (some reservations or duress can work in the right place, but not outright non-con).

*\*\* I might swap out Miss E for a couple of other names, but do check first. I don't have a list of names to play which is massively long.*

I had emailed previously early in the month about my October order and got an automated response, then another unprompted email apology for delays (also clearly automated) and then a 3rd unprompted email saying they were closing the ticket since the issue was ‚Äúresolved‚Äù. WTF?!  
I had been hesitant to respond because I saw in a thread here that it would kick me to the bottom of the system for my order. Now only 1 out of us 4 friends get the cardigan or we‚Äôll have to do a ‚Äúsisterhood of the traveling cardigan‚Äù series. Not happening. 
Any confirmation that emailing them kicked my order to the bottom of the queue?

"Hi there. I want to do some kind of roleplay where I play as Olivia Rodrigo and play out some adventures of her being either a super kinky experienced person or someone that has never experienced some of these things and the journey that she has to becoming a super kinky girl.

Just a few kinks: piss, pet play, beast, bdsm, forced, gagging, gangbang, facials, collars, leashes, interactions with other puppygirls, being made to pee and shit on command (optional), spankings (lots of them!) , dogfood, blowjobs, facefucking, facefucking til I puke, anal, humiliation, public, abdl, diapers, hypnosis

No limits!

I‚Äôm 18+ and all people involved in this have to be 18+. This is all just a fantasy. Also all of my posts are still open if you find one that you want to do.

"I've been reading recent posts about the challenges of buying concert tickets and it's disheartening. Given the prices, one would expect at least a chance for a meet and greet. I fondly recall meeting artists like G-Eazy and Marc E Bassy at more reasonable prices in 2015/2016, but times have changed.

In my early twenties, I loved attending concerts. However, it's painful to see fans emotionally and mentally drained just because they wish to see their favorite artist perform. Until there's proper legislation addressing this issue, I won't be contributing to the problem. Significant change might only come when these venues feel the financial pinch or when top-tier artists notice a tarnish on their reputation.

Imagine if major artists decided to go on tour strikes? Ticketmaster would likely scramble to amend their practices. While I'm not deeply into the politics of ticket sales, there's a definite need for binding contracts between artists and ticket-selling venues. This would ensure fixed price points and give every fan an equitable opportunity to purchase tickets.

Measures should be introduced for authentic sales, such as verifying the affiliation of registered emails on ticket sites like Ticketmaster or Live Nation with the artist. Perhaps through the artist's newsletter subscriptions or past purchase records, ensuring that tickets go to genuine fans rather than opportunistic resellers.

It would be disheartening to see performers like Olivia playing to areas with noticeable gaps, knowing that those vacant spots represent overpriced tickets being hawked outside the venue.

I've spent multiple summers around arenas and venues in my city, always on the periphery. The closest I came to the action was hearing sound checks, missing the genuine fan-to-artist connection.

For those lucky enough to attend, cherish the experience. Belt out every lyric for those fans who couldn't make it. If you've secured floor or pit seats, put effort into your signs and appearance to motivate artists like Olivia to deliver their best. It's the least we can do.

But for now, rest up. Tomorrow is another day.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OliviaRodrigo/comments/16o8zwl/guts_show_will_be_my_last_ticketmaster_transaction/,GUTS show will be my last Ticketmaster transaction,OliviaRodrigo,t3_16o8zwl,/r/OliviaRodrigo/comments/16o8zwl/guts_show_will_be_my_last_ticketmaster_transaction/,2023-09-21 07:00:40,Olivia Rodrigo

"Lucked out and scored pre-sale today, and scored four tickets to Adele on March 9. Was 1284th in line, wasn't very optimistic about getting any non-dynamic priced tickets so I filtered to hide platinum and to include fees and started clicking around in a panic. Everything was disappearing in the central 100s and I was sh\*tting myself worried that the prices would be dynamically inflated at any second so I bought:

**Artist Registration Sale** Sec¬†102,¬†Row¬†L,¬†Seat¬†XXX-XXX USD $779.82 x 4

**Fees** USD¬†$5.50¬†(Order Processing Fee) USD¬†$120.00¬†(Service Fee)¬†x 4

**Tax** USD $70.18 x 4

**Ticket Delivery** eTickets Free

**USD $3885.50**

I know I should be grateful that these weren't dynamic priced, but almost 1k per ticket on the far side is insane, right? I got 206 row M in the central aisle last December for $420 per ticket all in, during the last presale. I love our gal, but I'd never spent that much - and now *this* much - on a concert in my life.

I am going to convince you this is the best album of the year. I may or may not believe that, but I like a challenge. According to Spotify founder Daniel Ek, [‚Äúclose to 40,000‚Äù](https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/nearly-40000-tracks-are-now-being-added-to-spotify-every-single-day/) tracks are added to the platform *daily.* While a portion of those are released by [invisible, fake artists](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jul/13/are-spotifys-fake-artists-any-good), the question stands ‚Äì are the tracks ‚ÄúAttention‚Äù, ‚ÄúHype Boy‚Äù, ‚ÄúCookie‚Äù, and ‚ÄúHurt‚Äù, by the rookie kpop act NewJeans better than the other (hold on let me do the math‚Ä¶ 40,000 x 7 x 52‚Ä¶ 14,560,000 - 4‚Ä¶) ***14,559,996*** songs platformed this year?

Finding the answer takes more than just the songs.

# ADORable

In 2021 kpop was saved. After a decade and a half of co-producing, co-managing, and co-contracts alongside lesser kpop corporations, Big Hit Entertainment was reborn as HYBE Corporation. This rebirth represented two things: the first, that BTS‚Äôs charisma and Big Hit‚Äôs management savvy could out-compete the historical ‚Äúbig three‚Äù production companies of kpop. The second, that you can acquire your way to the top.

Big Hit‚Äôs transition to HYBE included the acquisition of Pledis Entertainment, the home of 13-member boy group Seventeen (and gone-too-soon PRISTIN. RIP PRISTIN); Source Music, the former home of now-disbanded GFriend (RIP GFriend); and KOZ Entertainment, home of Zico. From a business standpoint, this multi-label model is a big brain move on HYBE‚Äôs part. While other kpop production, recording, and distribution companies have to maneuver these services and resources between groups and time releases to prevent eating at their own sales, HYBE can distribute a release schedule among multiple companies with their own dedicated teams, keeping an even flow of releases that direct profits to the parent corporation.

*But* the reason this model is successful is because HYBE's sub-labels are already successful. So, to prove the model, HYBE needs to reinvest those profits in a brand new group.

Enter Min Heejin. In 2002, the graphic designer joined SM Entertainment (SME), with an undeniable odd eye ([get it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPp9da0-Q_E)). She moved up the ranks at SME, designing and executing experimental, exciting, and bold concepts for popular groups, including SNSD/Girls Generation (where she is credited with both the [iconic jeans and t-shirts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7mPqycQ0tQ) looks from the ‚ÄúGee‚Äù era and the [naval uniforms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SwiSpudKWI) from ‚ÄúGenie‚Äù), SHINee (where her visual design credits include [‚ÄúDream Girl‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhxjEXDAy6s) and [‚ÄúView‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF53cptEE5k)), EXO (the mysterious Pathcode teaser ARG is hers), and Red Velvet (everything is too iconic to name).

Min Heejin‚Äôs visual influence lives in SME artists today, who are known for quirky, campy visual concepts, even without her presence. In fact, her influence is all over kpop. When we talk about ‚Äúconcepts‚Äù in kpop, we are talking about tightly controlled art direction that marries album packaging, music video direction, on- and off-stage fashion, merchandise, and more to a single song it‚Äôs all supposed to promote, a practice she perfected.

Min Heejin joined HYBE in 2019 as chief brand officer, after serving two years on SME‚Äôs Board of Directors. Her first order of business was to establish her own girl group (HYBE‚Äôs only girl group at the time was GFriend in collaboration with Source Music). HYBE [launched global auditions in 2019](https://www.nme.com/news/music/big-hit-entertainment-global-auditions-new-k-pop-girl-group-2545017), and the search began for powerful, sunny ‚Äúunicorns‚Äù who would revolutionize fourth-generation kpop. The [audition trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEEa6V0f-6M) featured some pretty young girls, indicating‚Ä¶ something. Kpop companies love molding their superstars from a young age, so young auditionees would be young trainees would be triple, even quadruple threats by the time they debut. I‚Äôm inclined to not say much more here except that Minji, who would debut in NewJeans is [actually featured in other audition trailers](https://www.instagram.com/p/B19-q13gBIy/) on Instagram.

Auditions closed and [were opened up again](https://www.bandwagon.asia/articles/hybe-launches-global-auditions-for-their-new-label-ador-how-to-join-singing-rapping-dance-acting-min-hee-jin-korea-december-2021) in late 2021 to early 2022, after GFriend left Source Music and Min Heejin was given control of her own label, ADOR (All Doors One Room).

And that‚Äôs where it begins.

# New year, NewJeans

On July 1st, 2022, ADOR teased the launch of their first-ever girl group. The date was set, July 22, 2022; but what would come out? When EXO was set to debut, members showed off their assigned superpowers in a [two month-long teaser process](https://seoulbeats.com/2012/01/exo-planet-pre-debut-summary-and-potential/), culminating in two ‚Äúprologue‚Äù singles, and [finally the gregorian banger ‚ÄúMama.‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KH6ZwnqZ7Wo) LOONA spent (hold on, doing the math again) *18 months* in the pre-debut stage, releasing \~47 songs before officially debuting. In a world of pre-debut gimmicks, what would this new group do to stand out?

They dropped a music video.

July 22, 2022, NewJeans caught everyone‚Äôs [‚ÄúAttention.‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js1CtxSY38I) In an industry built on meticulous, intricate planning and awash with ‚Äúnugu‚Äù debuts, the surprise drop of NewJeans‚Äô debut track was risky. In an interview with Billboard, Min Heejin described the decision as anathema to the current kpop process of endless teasers and exhaustive branding:

&gt;‚ÄúThat was a strategy we used to put all the focus purely on their music, since the buzz around ‚ÄúMin Hee Jin‚Äôs girl group‚Äù was already so high.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúWe tend to stick with what‚Äôs stable because we fear failure, but nothing interesting ever happens if you just stick with what‚Äôs stable. If we‚Äôre ever going to make the world a little more interesting, we have to try new things and adopt an attitude of being more open and accepting about it.‚Äù [(Billboard)](https://www.billboard.com/music/pop/newjeans-interview-hybe-ador-girl-group-min-hee-jin-1235141512/)

In less than 24 hours, NewJeans announced the next single, ‚ÄúHype Boy‚Äù, and their eponymous EP, *New Jeans*, all before the public knew the girls names. Another calculated risk from Min Heejin:

&gt;‚ÄúThe role of a teaser is to make people curious, but it had become more like inertia, and I felt it was unnecessary‚Ä¶ With no information revealed about the members, people would keep on replaying the music video, and I expected this would lead them to continue searching about them online. After watching the second music video, in which the members‚Äô names are revealed, I anticipated that people would come back to the first video to look them up.‚Äù [(Korea Herald)](https://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20220829000665)

And she was right: With over 440,000 sales, the *New Jeans* EP set a record for first-week sales for a girl group debut, breaking the record set by HYBE compatriots LE SSERAFIM.

*ASIDE: LE SSERAFIM*

*Just two months before NewJeans debuted, HYBE tested out its first original girl group on its Source Music label, the classy and sassy LE SSERAFIM. Two of its members were previously in IZ\*ONE after making it to the final of Produce48, an idol survival competition show. Aside from the selection of members known to the public thanks to Produce48, the rest of the members were named and teased ahead of time ‚Äì something that would ultimately damage the group: before debuting, LE SSERAFIM member Kim Garam was the subject of a bullying scandal.*

*Two months after her debut, Kim Garam was* [*unceremoniously dropped*](https://www.straitstimes.com/life/entertainment/le-sserafim-singer-kim-ga-ram-removed-from-group-over-bullying-allegations) *from the label. It was unclear how the group would recover from such a public, controversial lineup change.* [*It ended up being fine*](https://www.soompi.com/article/1558969wpp/watch-le-sserafim-snags-5th-win-for-antifragile-on-music-core-performances-by-nct-dream-wsg-wannabe-and-more)*.*

If the surprise debut was risky, the [""Hype Boy""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11cta61wi0g) drop was dangerous. ADOR published *four* music videos for one song, including one in which a member of NewJeans has a crush on another girl \[insert eyes emoji here!!!\]. The four videos follow NewJeans members, [now introduced to the public by name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHYWqy_X-tU), falling in love with their own ‚Äúhype boys‚Äù, while at a house party reminiscent of a Disney Channel Original Movie. The next day, [‚ÄúHurt‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVIXY14aJms) dropped as a b-side to the other two tracks. A week later, the final single went live, called [‚ÄúCookie.‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOmIplFAGeg)

You‚Äôve probably heard the phrase ‚Äúthe medium is the message,‚Äù coined by some Canadian guy from the 60s or whatever. Before I move onto a track review, I want to impress upon you how novel NewJeans‚Äô debut is: not just three songs in as many days, with a fourth so soon after, but that they were all good and different and unique and refreshing. But it‚Äôs sheer luck that the songs are good. After all, Min Heejin‚Äôs previous concepts are noted for their character and iconic-itude even if the tracks they accompany are not remembered as fondly by the industry or the public (RIP f(x)). The reason this EP gets an Album of the Year write up is because the frenetic release schedule told a story that This Group is Worth Watching. The music is only one part of that story.

# But now, the music

I‚Äôm going to restrain myself from talking about the music videos here. As much as I really want to go film school mode on you all, this is an *album* review and I‚Äôve already spent a long time on things that aren‚Äôt the album. Onto the songs for real this time!

*You got me looking for* **attention (**[""Attention""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js1CtxSY38I)**)**

The opening ten seconds set the tone: you are in high school, you and your friends are sitting on the bleachers at lunch, clapping along while the performer of the bunch glides and grooves on the grass to a completely acoustic rendition ‚Äì no, *acapella* rendition ‚Äì of TLC‚Äôs ‚ÄúWaterfalls‚Äù, complete with percussive cheers and whoops from those with their hands too deep in a bag of chips to clap along. Maybe that‚Äôs a little too evocative, but that‚Äôs what this song wants you to feel. When the keyboards kick in, you can‚Äôt help the feeling in your neck to sway.

For a majority of the verses, the keys are sparse. The song is profoundly empty in production, but to its success. There is a homegrown feeling, especially in the chorus, where the increase in production complexity is complemented by a simple line, ‚Äúyou got me looking for attention‚Äù, free from excessive ra-ta-tas and stuttered, cluttered lyrics other summer kpop releases relied on.

As the album and video introduction to the group, the minimal production allows the girls‚Äô voices to shine. Two-part harmonies (or at least to my untrained ear‚Ä¶) add variation instead of forcing in a bridge to showcase 3 seconds of a strained high note (really, the NewJeans origin story is very much about what they *didn‚Äôt* do as a debut group, as much as it is about what they did).

Also, member Danielle is credited as a writer on this track, and I have no choice but to credit the sickeningly sweet ‚Äúyou give me butterflies, you know‚Äù line to her. It might actually be the single best English line in kpop history.

My verdict? Song so good I showed my dad, who doesn‚Äôt know anything about kpop.

*You're my chemical* **hype boy (**[""Hype Boy""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11cta61wi0g)**)**

The verdict was out if NewJeans can count higher than three, where they ended in ‚ÄúAttention,‚Äù but luckily in ‚ÄúHype Boy‚Äù we get a satisfying four-count to start the track. And like ‚ÄúAttention‚Äù, ‚ÄúHype Boy‚Äù opens with chopped vocals used as percussion and production details, but darker and faster.

If ‚ÄúAttention‚Äù is about having a crush, ‚ÄúHype Boy‚Äù is about making sure he is yours. Forget the schoolyard chants; an oscillating drone in the bottom layer, muted tropical percussion, and a future bass beat toe the line between refreshing and edgy. Though this track‚Äôs reception is colored by the Y2K-nostalgia of the prior release, it is not so direct a send-up. Instead, the structure, especially the disarming pre-chorus, fits in with contemporary, fourth gen title tracks, but the limited vocal processing, emphasis on the brightness of members‚Äô unstrained voices, and galloping percussion separate ‚ÄúHype Boy‚Äù from other summer releases, like ‚ÄúSneakers‚Äù or ‚ÄúNabillera (ÎÇòÎπåÎ†àÎùº)‚Äù).

This time, member Hanni contributed to the lyrics, though there is an unfortunate lack of her Aussie accent poking through!

*Looking at my* **cookie (**[""Cookie""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOmIplFAGeg)**)**

Of the singles, ‚ÄúCookie‚Äù is the odd one out. It‚Äôs downright mischievous, dark, and mature. It is hard to place ‚Äì imagine yourself listening to this in a salon, or an airport, or on the moon and the experience is the same. Like the other tracks, it sends up popular music of the aughts, with trap trills and a bouncy, funky, Fergalicious synth.

Like ‚ÄúHype Boy‚Äù and ‚ÄúAttention‚Äù ahead of it, and like Min Heejin‚Äôs previously-affiliated artists, there is a humor and sincerity permeating the track. Kitsch is good in the right hands, and perhaps NewJeans are those hands.

*'Cause I'm not gonna be the one to get* **hurt (**[""Hurt""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVIXY14aJms)**)**

Y2K move over, we‚Äôre throwing it back to the Ronettes with percussive *whoos* and hi-hats to keep time while beautiful young girls croon over losing a love.

‚ÄúHurt‚Äù, unfortunately but purposefully (well, presumably), is very dry. It is the quintessential kpop b-side: a competent R&amp;B track, with perfectly cromulent melodic production. If you like Red Velvet b-sides, this will fit in your playlist full of them with ease, but missing the mature vocal color of Seulgi or Wendy.

# Is it the songs or the stunt?

If I finished writing this a couple of months ago, I could‚Äôve asked a really good question: will NewJeans live beyond their stunt debut? Luckily for you and unluckily for my timing, we already have the answer: NewJeans‚Äô sophomore effort proves Min Heejin‚Äôs knack for executing gimmicky concepts that would fall flat in lesser hands. ‚ÄúDitto‚Äù and ‚ÄúOMG‚Äù, their latest tracks, were accompanied by experimental launches, this time with multiple music videos telling a story I will not attempt to describe.

Maybe last month I found myself wondering if the NewJeans‚Äô music was just good enough to serve the experiment, but now I think all of the gimmicks serve to promote the incredible producers, singers, and creatives that make up ADOR. The experiment is working.

# Drop the, drop the question

I was going to ask: Do you think NewJeans continues with a Y2K heavy sound or will they adapt to trends outside of Y2K nostalgia? ~~but NewJeans recently released ‚ÄúDitto‚Äù which I think answers this question to an extent‚Ä¶ Do you think they keep going?~~ Is NewJeans going to last longer than the Y2K nostalgia moment, if they do continue to hammer into the theme?

Will we see a girl crush concept from them? Will it work?!

In a world where ""Attention"" is the only single, like in other kpop releases, would we hear about the NewJeans' b-sides? Would ""Hype Boy"" have been as successful?

1. Meet in a public place.
2. Do not give out your hotel or room number.
3. Be cautious of who you add on some social media. Some social media (like Snapchat's Snapmap) can share your location to friends.
4. Always keep your drink(s) in your line-of-sight and don't take drinks (or anything else-- it's Vegas after all) from someone you just met, unless you see them get it from the bar.

The music video makes me want to dance like she is to this song in my home. I've never been cheated on but I can understand her pain and then growth from this song. It's amazing and I hope others, not just women feel this way if this situation ever happened to them.

"

To me I think the Debut (TV) track list is the more interesting to think to speculate about in the upcoming re-releases because we know Taylor was so prolific and because we have so many of the demo's that exist from that time period. Debut it also such a small album so I think there is a lot of space to add in more things, which I think Taylor will do to try and help drive that #1 (considering debut is the least popular it is the only one with *any* risk of not hitting it). 

I leveraged stuff I remember from that era and things people have written about the demos to guess what the Debut track list will look like. I am using a targeted 26-30 album size considering the sizes of Fearless and Red. 

The Original Track List w. Bonus Tracks 
1. Tim McGraw
2. Picture to Burn
3. Teardrops on My Guitar
4. A Place in This World
5. Cold as You
6. The Outside
7. Tied Together with a Smile""
8. Stay Beautiful
9. Should've Said no 
10. Mary's Song (Oh My My My)	
11. Our Song
12. I'm Only Me When I'm with You
13. Invisible 
14. A Perfectly Good Heart

Unlikely to be on the album 
1. Taylor Swift's 1st Phone Call with Tim McGraw
2. Teardrops on My Guitar"" (Pop Version)
3. Anything from that nonsense holiday special 

Released Songs Not From the Album 
15. Beautiful Eyes 
16. I Heart? 
17. Permanent Market (sold to X)
18. Crazier (50/50 on the chances of this one)

Vault Songs. This is where I struggled the most. She has performed I‚Äôd Lie and Dark Blue Tennessee during this era and I *really* like them so I would love them to be in the section above but realistically probably here. I determined this by which early Taylor songs I like but also what‚Äôs popular with fans. I assume just like the first two re-recordings this section will be six songs. 
19. I‚Äôd Lie
20. Dark Blue Tennessee 
21. Sweet Tea and God's Graces
22. Diary of Me 
23. Nashville
24. This is Really Happening 

One Weird Remix. Come on you know this would be here
27. Our Song remix",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/10fmt3u/debut_taylors_version_predicted_track_list/,Debut (Taylor's Version) Predicted Track List,TaylorSwift,t3_10fmt3u,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/10fmt3u/debut_taylors_version_predicted_track_list/,2023-01-19 00:07:01,Taylor Swift

"Hailing from the UK, PinkPantheress with her jungle/dnb/breakbeat sound is something that she's famously known for. 

And now it seems that NewJeans are inching one step closer to adopting the UK sound as part of their identity as well. (Which I really like).

&#x200B;

So I'm only basing this on two things, their recent testing of waters with Ditto (UK breakbeat birthed baltimore club) and because of the particular writers on the upcoming ASAP. 

&#x200B;

""Lizardo Erika de Casier e Ramos"" (one of the writers on ASAP) or Erika de Casier, is an artist that I've known about for a while and that's because of her affiliation with Mura Masa. Mura Masa, a producer that also hails from the UK, is well known in the producer community and has had a massive influence on the scene en masse and gloabally. 

Funnily enough, he's worked with both of these artists. [""Boy's a liar""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_hj-wT3biU), [""bbycakes""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBXtJGLhSk8) (two of the more famous songs feat. Pinkpanthereess) is a production of his and similar production chops can be heard on Erika de Casier's music, [especially her recent stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbs5Hg2fYD4). E-motions is a banger and the soulful writing meshes so well w/ the deep and swingy groove that accommodates it, it's essentially a hallmark of UK garage.

The way I'd describe the sound that most of these artists have under their repertoire is the fusing of electronic production techniques with organic and eclectic instrumentation, which might be the musical direction that NewJeans are heading towards as well now. 

&#x200B;

I honestly think it's a very unique style that not many in KPOP are doing at all and whomever spearheaded this musical/artistic direction (might be Min Heejin), honestly, they made the right move. 

Adopting this sound as part of their identity (especially in KPOP that have only a handful of archetypical styles) it makes them stand out so much more and I'm really excited to hear how the new EP will sound. As mentioned, I'm going to bet that it will be heavily ""PinkPantheress"" influenced or indirectly ""UK"" inspired because of the connections to the scene. 

&#x200B;

*I also can't forget but I do recognize that Monro who produced Zero is also based in the UK and the production on Zero had a similar flavor profile.*

I'm a lot older than many Swifties, but Taylor got my attention early on as I kept seeing this kind of thing in local news, or hearing about it from people I know.  I've lost count of how many amazing local causes she's supported. 

Some used to wonder what I saw in her (since the rest of my record collection are indie records much cooler than hers. Or so they thought.) I'm glad the world doesn't wonder any more since she's now such an amazing accomplished artist, and I can't say how proud of her I am that she's still doing this after so many years.  #Swiftie4Life #SwiftieOver50 #NashvilleüíôsYouBackTS",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/10eqbqn/taylor_out_being_generous_again_donates_to/,Taylor out being generous again: Donates to Nashville area animal shelter,TaylorSwift,t3_10eqbqn,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/10eqbqn/taylor_out_being_generous_again_donates_to/,2023-01-17 22:54:21,Taylor Swift

"Olivia Rodrigo‚Äôs sophomore album sounds exactly like it was made by someone transitioning out of their teen years and into the peripheries of adulthood, and that‚Äôs both a good and bad thing. Speaking on *GUTS*, the twenty-year-old said that the album ""is about growing pains and trying to figure out who I am at this point in my life.‚Äù With songs dedicated to candidly unpacking a new round of romantic trauma, Rodrigo warmly embraces her role as the industry's premiere romantic doomsayer. Though this part of her character seems rock solid, there‚Äôs an unshakeable feeling that her proper voice is still developing.

  
*GUTS* is an album of two halves. Much like on her last album, Rodrigo alternates between dynamics. The tender ballads are still here, but Rodrigo‚Äôs preferred scenery is pedestrian punk and pop-rock. The pulsating piano keys and gradually swelling percussion that made *drivers license* such a stand-out pop song again set up the framework for the most compelling moments on the album, but Rodrigo‚Äôs ambitions to toy with punk conventions frequently pull her away from what she is best at. 

  
Much of the album is concerned with heartbreak and the struggles of maintaining healthy relationships while being in the public eye. Rodrigo has said that it felt like she had grown ten years between the ages of eighteen and twenty, and part of that can surely be attributed to the emotional turmoil she sings of here. All types of wicked characters materialize in Rodrigo‚Äôs lyrics. There are scheming men who take advantage of her (*vampire*, *logical*) and losers who aren‚Äôt worth mentioning (*love is embarrassing*), however, that‚Äôs only part of the equation. Rodrigo is scathing in her assessment of her exes but she also doesn‚Äôt shy away from judging herself. ‚ÄúWhen am I gonna stop being wise beyond my years and just start being wise?‚Äù she sings on *teenage dream*, cheekily critiquing her own dating habits. It‚Äôs one of the many cases on *GUTS* where she cleverly acknowledges her public perception. 

  
That self-awareness - among others several other qualities - has earned her comparisons to Taylor Swift, an artist whom the singer has identified as an inspirational figure, in the past. With the grittier, angstier tonal shift that defines *GUTS*, that likeness dries up. Many of these songs feature contortion, compositions overcrowded by guitars, and bratty, boisterous choruses, all traits that bring to mind Avril Lavigne. The former pop-punk queen seems to be Rodrigo‚Äôs new fixation, and her attempts to mirror her idol are rarely effective. On *ballad of a homeschooled girl*, Rodrigo blares her words out aiming to recreate Lavigne‚Äôs fervent attitude, however, she mistakes energy for tunefulness and volume for emotion. It‚Äôs often not her voice we‚Äôre hearing but rather a poor affectation of someone else. 

  
Dan Nigro reprises his role as Rodrigo‚Äôs right-hand man. His production is a mixed bag. For forays into the realms of rock and punk, he leans on shiny decorative perks to try and sheath how risk-averse he is. *get him back!* is an empty spectacle. It sounds stadium-sized because Rodrigo uses an exaggerated cartoonish demeanour and there a gurgling, distorted guitars - yet these two elements never coalesce properly, making the song hiccup and splutter across an excruciating three-and-a-half-minutes. The producer‚Äôs greatest offense is mostly just being uninventive. Both *love is embarrassing* and *pretty isn‚Äôt pretty* are suppressed by his peppering of streamlined instrumentation. As Rodrigo amps up her delivery, edging closer to exploding into a fit of rage, Nigro keeps her grounded, putting a cap on her vigour. 

  
Few current pop producers are more proficient a crafting slow-burning ballads, however. Nigro and Rodrigo both sound more comfortable in this mode. Instead of fighting to share a spot in the foreground, Nigro works tirelessly to wring wonderfully stimulated performances out of his partner. The producer pairs Rodrigo‚Äôs sullen purring on *the grudge* with preppy piano keys to advance momentum until the two-minute mark, where Rodrigo finds a second wind. For the final iteration of the bridge and chorus, the roles reverse, Nigro‚Äôs strings cradle the singer as she lets out war cries, expanding her voice to emphasize the venom she holds for an ex that built her up to watch her fall.

   
The one-two punch of *vampire* and *lacy* is also striking. With space afforded to her, Rodrigo performs pressed to the mic, enunciating her words so carefully you can practically hear her frustration (anger on the former, exhaustion on the latter) with the wrongdoers in her life build with each syllable she sings. The close recording method adds tension, magnifying each of her movements and putting on full display Rodrigo‚Äôs emotional range. On *vampire*, the singer is itching to unload her ammunition on a manipulative older man, her performance direct and fierce. There‚Äôs ostensibly less going on during *lacy*; the song is filled with just a gently finger-picked guitar and Rodrigo‚Äôs warbling voice for the most part, yet it stings just as much. 

  
A full album of songs just like *vampire* and *lacy* would be the ideal way to get your dose of Olivia Rodrigo. In just two tracks, she displays so many facets; the loud and soft dynamics, her aggressive streak and vulnerable side, stylistic limberness. This duad exists separately from the rest of *GUTS*, free from the jarring transitions, odd pacing, and gaudy production choices that weigh the rest of the album down. Rodrigo is clearly still trying to figure this whole celebrity thing out. Should she stick with the ballads though, I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôll be a formidable force in the pop world for years to come.

&gt; *My pussy precedes me*

In many ways this album is still not fully real to me - I could not contain my excitement building up to its release, and SZA did it in her typical last minute, mystical fashion. The anticipation mounting through the Shirt video teasers, the SNL performance rumours, the cover art, all before we even got a date! It is like she knows the one thing her fans don't trust her with is actually releasing the music. But I think the long runtime of the album and it happening in December meant for some reason I didn't really sit with this album the same way I have with every other SZA release, so I'm thankful for this writeup getting the chance to reflect on the themes of this album.

SZA (born Solana Rowe, or at least that's what she's told us) has always made the music she wanted to make, her early EP's ([*See.SZA.Run*](https://mixtapemonkey.com/1001/sza-seeszarun), [*S*](https://mixtapemonkey.com/1002/sza-s) &amp; [*Z*](https://open.spotify.com/album/2qCyMMQ785sPH4Yx25GQZ8?si=7fd7a505401e4a6f)) are a gorgeous blend of alternative R&amp;B and neo-soul, with SZA singing over brooding hip-hop beats in the vein of The Weeknd, Kelela and Miguel's early work and tracks like [Aftermath](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfSKna7YEMY) and [Julia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atc2_C-rW3s) being her first interpolation of bright synths into her music! This early work built up her fanbase and set the stage for the absolutely mammoth [*Ctrl*](https://open.spotify.com/album/76290XdXVF9rPzGdNRWdCh?si=d8dbefbf260e4f80), an album where she continued to make the music she wanted to, it just so happened that this time the music she wanted to make was the future of the genre.

Now I could write an entire 4000 words on Ctrl, but that isn't what I'm here to do, so let's summarise mama: Ctrl took her industrial, claustrophobic instrumentals and swapped them out for luscious, diverse production, from the confessional album-opener [Supermodel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tiixq9rT_J0) to the sexy and melancholic [The Weekend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMD63TwzB1o), SZA showed she was multi-faceted not just in musical style but lyrical content too, tackling themes she'd later revisit on SOS like heartbreak, insecurity and fear with ease. Ctrl utilises SZA's star power to have features from giants of the genre, Travis Scott, Isaiah Rashard and Kendrick Lamar and have SZA still run the show. Weaved together with voicenotes from her mother and grandmother, Ctrl is practically a masterclass in how to place yourself in an echelon above your peers and create a tight, timeless album while doing so.

So, how do you follow up a perfect album? For a while SZA's answer was simple, you don't! Unlike most of her [album repellent peers](https://static1.purepeople.com/articles/5/11/66/35/@/1068715-sky-ferreira-and-singer-franck-ocean-950x0-1.jpg) she wasn't allergic to releasing music, she dropped some [brilliant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJlMkMtK7-8) [loosies](https://soundcloud.com/user-666318062/joni-sza?utm_source=clipboard&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing), worked on the Trolls, Space Jam and Dear Evan Hanson soundtracks and had smash collaborations in [All The Stars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQbjS0_ZfJ0) with Kendrick Lamar and [Kiss Me More](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EVVKs6DQLo) with Doja Cat, all while promising an album but never promising when. SOS is a peace offering to the fans, she finally gives us another brilliant album, in return for us giving her peace.

I'm gonna be breaking *SOS* up into the themes SZA explores rather than a track-by-track breakdown, because 23 is a big number! To me SZA is someone who uses their talents to heal, SZA writes and sings what she sometimes cannot say, and I think that is often misconstrued for her promoting toxic or anti-feminist habits and it is not that at all, it is just her admitting those flaws live inside of her. The album touches on many emotions she's written about in the past, while also showing a different side to Solana, a brighter more confident one.

---

### Confidence

&gt; *I'm horny like ""Suck these""*  
&gt; *So daring like ""Touch me""*

SZA embraces her new-found confidence, emulating 90s rap tracks at the start, midpoint and end of the album, a genre historic for it's braggadocious tendencies. Title track [**SOS**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxflcXmtVTM) kicks off the album and couldn't be more of a juxtaposition from SZA's musical persona, where on Ctrl she was meek, on SOS she is brash and unafraid. In the same vein [**Forgiveless**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMmzVvyK1M8) closes off the album, featuring an unreleased Ol' Dirty Bastard verse and a sample of Bjork's [Hidden Place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54LQ_AO1gDI) - I'd always found this a kind of bizarre way to end the album, being that it feels like the feature and sample are more stars of the track than SZA herself is, but here SZA is paying homage to the music that made her, hip-hop and art pop. To me Forgiveless is just a companion piece to the opener, she is reminding you that she can sing about being  afraid and uncertain all throughout the album, but she is multifaceted and that's why she is on top.

On [**Low**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RdnZpZUmCA) SZA flips the dynamics she'd sung about before on their head, where now she is the one in power in the relationship, using her partner for sex and then discarding him *(""I need you to get the fuck out my space, replacement's on the way please don't play"")*, before bragging even further about how little she needs to depend on them in one of my favourite deepcuts [**Conceited**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91_fAY6DLgc), a bouncy, self-assured track.

### Heartbreak

&gt; *We both dangerous*  
&gt; *Moving so close we combust*

To paraphrase [Nicole Kidman](https://media.gq.com/photos/623b53f55b7ff3beb65d216d/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/nicole-kidman-amc-commercial.jpg): heartbreak feels good in an album like this. SZA's commentary on breakups and falling out of love is pensive but necessary, on [**Seek &amp; Destroy**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjQUIq7Rjcc), which samples one of SZA's earliest tracks [Euphraxia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndpl6Wfzcc), she sings about being the one to end the relationship because of her toxic habits, not wanting to but not seeing any other way. Similarly on the fun [**Too Late**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zwcd63tfoU), SZA maturely sings *""is it bad that I want more?""*, but she wouldn't be the SZA we all know and love if she always took the high road.

[**Kill Bill**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSRcC626prw), the breakout single on the release of the album (and hopefully future number one) makes use of the very ironic *""I'm so mature""* hook, in between SZA telling us of her plans to kill her ex. I think my favourite element of the song is that for all SZA mentions her ex in this song, she doesn't talk about him at all, who he is is not important - SZA simply doesn't want to be alone. The [music video](https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SZA-in-the-music-video-for-Kill-Bill.jpg) is such a perfect homage to the film too, I'd love for SZA to talk more in depth about films and actresses after how many songs she's had inspired by or named after them. Like where did she first see them? Because we know it wasn't on a TV.

&gt; *Shitty of you to make me feel just like this*  
&gt; *What I would do to make you feel just like this*

It's actually [embarassing](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/847522843733655645/1068610704933933127/image.png) how many plays I have of [**I Hate U**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEAEDKzjQTY), but that is a testament to just how cathartic of a song it is. Nothing really more complicated than what the song presents itself as, my favourite part has to be the *""I do""* and *""Fuck you""* ad-libs in the chorus, they bring such a level of pettiness and genuine anger that just *hits*. SZA does try to repair the relationships she's lost, as she sings on [**Used**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-DN5fG4HtM), but often the problems are the men she's with, that they *""loved me better when I tried less""*.

### Insecurity

&gt; *I don't wanna be your girlfriend*  
&gt; *I'm just tryna be your person*

I don't think many artists can capture insecurity the way SZA does, [**Notice Me**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPyaKVgVnFI) probably being the most on the nose but also most desperate lyrically on the album. She doesn't even need to be his girlfriend, she just needs to be loved by him, with or without label. The bright and boppy production is in such stark contrast to the lyrics, like SZA is in denial, trying to hide how much she just wants to be held. [**Nobody Gets Me**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNd_ufPG3x4) even in SZA's vocal delivery is pleading to just be heard, she sings again about how hard it is to be on her own (*""only like myself when I'm with you""*). Personally I was never a huge fan of Nobody Gets You on the album, the like kinda whiny west coast rock never did it for me a whole bunch but I can definitely understand its appeal and catharsis!

The genres SZA uses to explore and explain her own insecurity on this album are I think one of the coolest parts, [**F2F**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4i1fzHbqr_c) is a great pop-rock track (co-written by [Lizzo!!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/1036llk/rpopheads_aoty_3_lizzo_special/)), about fucking people to fill a void left by someone else. I really love the reference to [**Smoking on my Ex Pack**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZET6nvDjM) in the lyrics, and how it completely opposes the attitude of the song: Ex Pack is cool, calm, confident, whereas F2F is frantic and loud and desperate, showing SZA's emotional complexity. [**Special**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS7dvgYr6PM) however is the best song at encapsulating a raw [lack of self esteem](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/847522843733655645/1068645125137383474/image.png) on the album, I love how it flips upside down the theme of [Normal Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2LiwXtuLQ) from Ctrl, when SZA sings *""why'd you have to treat me like I was an ordinary girl?""*. The pure emotion she expresses at worrying that she's wasted the best of herself on a loser isn't just insecurity, it's fear.

### Fear

&gt; *Can you distract me from all the disaster?*  
&gt; *Can you touch on me and not call me after?*

[**Ghost in the Machine**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8EU5Sm9GQY) is my favourite song from the album and probably one of my favourite approaches to modern day fears of any song, SZA sings about wanting simpler distractions from the grander fears of life, if she's having relationship problems then she isn't thinking about the bigger problems that she can do nothing about. [Phoebe Bridger's](https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article22078436.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_PAY-TDMesP21052001.jpg) feature is a brilliant addition, her voice as always is hauntingly beautiful and she makes for the perfect co-star seeing how she tackles similar themes in [her music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i63yumCNdJs).

Another aspect of fear SZA sings about is a fear of being alone, or who you've become since you were last alone. On [**Far**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbXVLa8w_GU) SZA no longer recognises herself, being far from who she thinks she is. But I think the best way she handles this theme is in [**Shirt**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdFDrjfW548), a slick trap, R&amp;B beat being the backdrop for what is, to me, almost a stream of consciousness. The chorus is quite meandering in message, *""blood stain on my shirt, new bitch on my nerves, old n\*\*\*\* got curved, going back on my word, damn bitch you so thirsty""* is basically just SZA rambling off things she needs to sort out, kind of a sequel to [Broken Clocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVc-K1kKkVk) imo.

&gt; *I don't regret, just pretend shit never happened*  
&gt; *Half of us laying waste to our youth, it's in the present*

The fuzzy, dreamlike sound of [**Good Days**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p3zZoraK9g) makes for the perfect nostalgic storm. Good Days is one of those songs that really feels like a hug, SZA's slightly incomprehensible voice is the most heavenly tone as she sings about lost time and believing in the best. Without trauma dumping completely, I remember when the song finally dropped on Christmas 2020, I was having a not-very-good-time and after months of looping the teaser as a local file in my college library while I studied, it was the thing that calmed me down from quite a bad panic attack. Speaking of, [that snippet](https://texxandthecity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/sza-good-days.jpg) is one of my favourite SZA looks of all time. And funnily enough I used the [Hit Different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJlMkMtK7-8) music video as a reference for the short film I made later on in college.

From one iconic teaser to another, [**Blind**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UEM0dKbzAA) is another touching song about recognising your own imperfections and recognising their is often nothing you can do to change them. SZA is phenomenal at capturing that [twenty-something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnZcB5oA4U4) lost, unfulfilled feeling - A feeling as SZA discovers is a lot less daunting when you're not on your own.

### Love

&gt; *Nobody get the truth up out me quite like you*  
&gt; *You the definition of my right hand*  
&gt; *Never mind riding backseat when you lead me*

Love is an emotion pretty untapped by SZA until this album, she'd sung about longing, lust and attention but never actually being in love as openly as on [**Love Language**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnjg0CK3Ltw), where she pleads to her partner to tell her how to connect to them better so they can stay together. [**Snooze**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs0qR3-7lIY) and [**Gone Girl**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA6DIHIg5To) both are primarily about wanting to spend time with a significant other, even if they aren't completely receptive. Even SZA's love songs admittedly have a shadow hanging over them, on Snooze she sings *""How you threatening to leave and I'm the main one crying""*, but I want her to be happy so I'm just calling these ones love songs!

However on [**Open Arms**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyn2GzEV5JM) it really is pure love, and I think that makes it the heart of the album. SZA sings about being completely devoted to her partner, sharing what lengths she would go to just to stop herself from fucking it up. I do think the Travis feature is kinda unnecessary because like I don't want him on a SZA song unless he's singing about planting seed, but SZA's vocals are so beautiful it more than makes up for it.

---

### In conclusion

&gt; *Tryna find deeper meaning in nonsense*  
&gt; *Tryna grow without hating the process*

SZA clearly was not trying to create a body of work as tight and epic as Ctrl, if she was it wouldn't be 23 tracks long lmao. I think the album will probably always live in Ctrl's shadow, but if I'm honest I think like all R&amp;B albums of the last 5 years do and it's probably helped by the fact I've just sat here dissecting all the themes and looping the album, but lyrically and structurally this is clearly a cohesive project, and it is really cool to see how much she experiments with new sounds on the album! I felt a similar way with Solar Power ~~don't drag me~~, in the sense of the artist is clearly not trying to recreate a body of work they've already made, or even evoke the same reactions/response, so they're very hard to compare. At the end of the day, I think SOS has Good Days on it, so it slays.

ballad of a homeschool girl (I told Olivia how I felt and she brought out this song üíÄ)

love is embarrassing (me)

the grudge (something about this song makes me feel something‚Ä¶ different, I don't know how to explain it, it's so me and not at the same time)? The only thing I know for sure is that it is a tremendous song and tremendous lyrics üòû)

logical (I LOVE IT, IT GIVES ME TOO MANY VIBES TO ‚Äú1 step foward and 3 steps back‚Äù üòç)

Get him back! (TOO CONTRADICTORY I LOVE IT ü§™, it's like I love him but I hate him AHH I love it üòª)

making the bed (me in my most depressive moments üòü)

pretty isn't pretty (with a lot of important meaning for me üóø)

all-american b\*tch (to feel pretty while I get ready to go out üòã)

bad idea right? (me years ago)

lacy (it's as if what she sings is what I say to the ‚Äúperfect version of me‚Äù   )

vampire (actually I already listened to it ENOUGH and I got a bit bored but it's still very good, 10/10 ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è)

teenage dream (I really didn't want to put it down so low because I liked it, it just didn't touch my heart like others üò™)

"A little more than a month ago, I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/11a46cd/tomtsong00s20s_pop_song_with_a_catchy_chorus/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on r/tipofmytongue hoping and praying that someone knew which song I'd heard based on a couple of seconds of me whistling a melody that I barely remembered. Some absolute legends came through almost immediately and introduced me to Hype Boy by NewJeans. I honestly didn't know what I'd gotten myself into back then.

Fast forward to today and I just have to say, I'm absolutely enamored by their music. Every single one of their songs has been an instant click for me but I'm struggling to put into words as to why that is. I'm only somewhat relieved to know that I'm not alone in this feeling judging from some of the other postings in this subreddit. There is still an enigma about this group for me though. I mean, this is my first foray into K-pop so I thought it's just a genre specific thing but after checking out a couple of other groups, nobody even comes close to evoking emotions like NewJeans has done with their music.

I don't ""stan"" things but this is probably the closest I'll ever come. Apologies for not asking any questions or discussing any fan theories but I wholeheartedly just wanted to share my new found love for this amazing group. There is no doubt in my mind that they'll be the next big thing (some might say they're there already) but I'll always be rooting for their success from afar.

**Edit:** Not sure if I could reply to everyone but I wanted to thank all of you for the comments. Also, I didn't realize that the link to the whistling had 404'd but [here it is again](https://www.whyp.it/tracks/86807/mystery-song?token=AbGzq). It might be more obvious now I guess but at the time I was amazed how quickly people were able to figure it out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/NewJeans/comments/12evnno/discovering_newjeans_a_love_letter_from_a_new_fan/,Discovering NewJeans: A Love Letter from a New Fan,NewJeans,t3_12evnno,/r/NewJeans/comments/12evnno/discovering_newjeans_a_love_letter_from_a_new_fan/,2023-04-07 19:04:08,New Jeans

"So I been thinking about paying for the phoning subscription cause I want to support the girls, but I have some questions, I will appreciate if someone could answer them

1. Do the (One to One) option when you text to each individual member, do they see it the same as you, or it is like a private chat where the NJ member sees all the messages from everyone and she answers to them? 

2. All the messages the girls reply that everyone always can see them, or they have an option to answer to an specific person without anyone else‚Äôs seeing it? 

3. (Not a question) I will appreciate answers with at least some kind of evidence or proof that makes there answer have sense, if you are going to answer with speculations I will prefer for you to don‚Äôt answer my questions. Even tho, I will appreciate any answer that can help me finish with this debate I have.

(Extra) I know the girls are most of the time busy, or simply not getting on the app, and I know hundreds of persons text to them every day so I‚Äôm aware that probably they are not going to answer my messages, Im asking this questions cause I want to know everything as detailed as it can be, so I fully know what am getting on to, and to don‚Äôt face a disappointment after thinking things that are not going to happen.

Minji - 1. https://youtu.be/e1SCPHJdLNU ; 2. https://youtu.be/p1cE9T0CFCQ

In the first fancam i love the MV outfits, they look fun nd chill plus minji just looks really handsome there. I know people typically call girls beautiful but handsome is a word I think suits minji well. The second fancam honestly is one of my favourites for the whole of the group. 

Hanni - 1. https://youtu.be/lmJPeFW75qQ ; 2. https://youtu.be/7g7Xw_uJ4XE.

Hanni is my bias nd I would have added a lot more fancams but i restricted myself to only 2 fancams per member. Anyway, for the first fancam - the smile at the start. That's it, that's enough reason. The way her face glows up when she performs is just sooo endearing to watch. For the second fancam, hanni nd glasses r a combo I need more of. She's just gorgeous here nd I loved these outfits in the mv so I'm glad they did a stage with these. 

Danielle - 1. https://youtu.be/D0x7KSdVWYs ; 2. https://youtu.be/he_kmGDIB-o

First fancam - Same as hanni, it's the smile for me. Danielle is like the sun, always glows bright nd happy and her smile just lits up every inch of her face. Seeing her happy makes us audience smile too. For the second fancam I love the stickers nd makeup for this stage on dani. She looks extra beautiful. Plus her expressions r always fun to watch. 

Haerin - 1. https://youtu.be/Mfd7euBZANI ; 2. https://youtu.be/fajvR2IjnRc

A cat stuck in a human body üê±,  that's basically haerin ü•∞. Nd the first fancam here is the best example to support that statement. The long black hair looks beautiful on her plus her expressions here r really captivating. For the second fancam, this is their first stage I watched nd I remember it making an impact on me. I used to go back to this stage nd fancams for quite some time. Haerin looks gorgeous here. 

Hyein - 1. https://youtu.be/P8CTQxfxoqo ; 2. https://youtu.be/lg6O00c0dGU

It's funny how for hyein i love her expressions even before the song starts in the first fancam. She looks sooo cute nd the styling suits her a lot. I go back to this fancam especially for the first part before the song starts. The second fancam was their debut stage one nd she mesmerized me with her performance skills. Hyein really has an X factor to her on stage. She's really commanding. 

Anyway, what r ur favourite fancams / facecams of the members individually.

"I love the song Brutal.  It really captured my feelings when I was a teen. 

I like how it‚Äôs rock pop not the stereotypical sad ballad song. 

People probably roll their eyes toward this song. Cuz it‚Äôs so typically angsty teen vibe. 

However it feels like it helps me to release the anger and frustration inside me that I‚Äôve held for so long throughout my high school years.  Almost every part of lyrics is how I felt.  

I still feel about this way about myself on some days.   But not really anymore.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OliviaRodrigo/comments/15yn3vk/i_love_the_song_brutal/,I love the song BRUTAL,OliviaRodrigo,t3_15yn3vk,/r/OliviaRodrigo/comments/15yn3vk/i_love_the_song_brutal/,2023-08-22 23:58:12,Olivia Rodrigo
"( Talking into a üîä) CALLING ALL BUNNIES TO ACTION, ATTENTION PLEASEEE. 

Lol if it's cringe I apologise, but I just wanted to make sure i got u guys attention ( üé∂ u got me looking for attention üï∫ üé∂ ~~~~~). Anyway onto the main point of this post. 

I want this subreddit community to be a more involved nd  inclusive one to such an extent that anything related to newjeans nd discussion regarding the group, I come here instead of going to other kpop subreddits. Don't get me wrong, it's already good here as all news nd pics get updated immediately. I want more involvement from the bunnies side. 

Anytime I wanna talk about my love for newjeans, I can't talk freely in other subreddits without everyone nd their mother being toxic nd acting superior. Other kpop subreddits have their own hypocrisy nd bias against certain groups nd seems like newjeans is also becoming such a group. 

One thing I observed is that for such groups, their own subreddit is very inclusive, active nd encourages people to have discussions freely. So people who follow the group stick to their own sub reddits. Bts, blackpink, enhypen, stray kids etc sub reddits r really active nd exclusive to their fans but also welcoming to the new members. I want newjeans sub reddit to also be like that. 

Hope everyone participates in weekly discussions thread, shares their daily lives here to the extent they r comfortable, talk about what's happening in kpop not just limited to newjeans in that thread. Also mv theories posts, posts about the music etc r already being uploaded here so I'm happy. I hope everyone feels comfortable to talk nd interact here. let's grow a loving nd welcoming community here.",https://www.reddit.com/r/NewJeans/comments/102y9x8/calling_all_bunnies_to_action_a_need_to_become_a/,"Calling all Bunnies to Action, A need to become a welcoming community.",NewJeans,t3_102y9x8,/r/NewJeans/comments/102y9x8/calling_all_bunnies_to_action_a_need_to_become_a/,2023-01-04 08:31:21,New Jeans

"Hi! I recently got super into NewJeans' music and decided to order a random album on Amazon, and ended up getting Hyein! It arrived today and after looking through it I saw these photocards still in my package. I looked online everywhere but I don't think these are part of any sets, so I'm wondering if anyone else received them. They're reversible as well, so there are three in total with each member.

"Like many of you here, I have my Taylor playlist on repeat in anticipation of my tour date. I can‚Äôt wait to hear her live and experience the different eras. However, I noticed that 1989 has the smallest presence on my playlist. There are only 4 songs I actually listen to (Blank Space, arguably her best pop song and the best video, Wildest Dreams, New Romantics, and Clean). This is tied with Debut for me with the least amount of songs present. I know that 1989 is one of her most critically acclaimed albums and the one that made her a superstar, but I‚Äôm wondering if anyone else is underwhelmed by the album as a whole?

For context, I did a quick count of the number of songs from each era on my playlist:

Debut - 4
Fearless - 7
Speak Now - 13
Red - 5
1989 - 4
Reputation - 6
Lover - 7
Folklore - 15
Evermore - 11
Midnights - 11",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/130ss30/does_anyone_else_not_get_the_hype_for_1989_as_a/,Does anyone else not get the hype for 1989 as a whole?,TaylorSwift,t3_130ss30,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/130ss30/does_anyone_else_not_get_the_hype_for_1989_as_a/,2023-04-27 15:46:32,Taylor Swift

"Our favorite 5 person KPop group, is back! With a vengeance. NEWJEANS - NEWJEANS really blurs the line between singing and rapping. This group, consisting of gen Z members, are really embracing the ""tik tok"" sound. The beat is reminiscent of UK garage ala Pink Pantheress, and a little bit of Pop. 

This is ONLY an intro, so it's hard to judge or review an intro, but I feel like the bar has been set so high for me, due to Hypeboy, Ditto and OMG, that this FEELS like an intro 

The music video is A+, Warner bros really helped visualize the concept of super girls, and finding power within each other. 

Over all, the lyrics are very Gen Z, Tik Tok, the beat is very upbeat, energetic. 

What are your thoughts on this video? Where would you rank it in their current discography? Remember this is only an INTRO for their album. 

I would give this a solid 7-8/10. (10 being Ditto, OMG and Hypeboy)

"Honestly, I LOVED it and thought it was pretty good. It was not amazing, but it was a really good show. She sang really well, and the simplicity was nice. Also the platform was anxiety inducing as hell, especially for a pregnant women. It was a very good show, but of course snobby people like some of y'all on here can never be pleased. Y'all always have something negative to say. Sometimes I feel like people on the internet can be followers, so if 3 people say it was bad, EVERYONE thinks it's bad lol. And some of y'all just hate her because of the johnny deep think. I am a rihanna fan, but this is completely unbiased. She did great! Singing was pretty on point too. One thing I didn't like was no big big suprise or performers and also her dancing was medicore, actually a bit bad, but she was pregnant, so that could excuse it.

I would also like to point out the disgusting comparison to famous pregnant women performing. Someone said ""BEyOnCe dId bEtTeR PReGnaNt"" and that is rude and insensitive as hell.

When posting, please include all relevant information: date, number of tickets, cost, ticket section/row/seat(s), and willingness to separate tickets. I'm included a template below. You don't have to use this of course, but it gives a nice idea of what a helpful post includes.

"As the first US leg of the Eras Tour comes to an end, I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about what made this tour so special. I went to a show and tailgated another, and I had an incredible time. Taylor made everyone feel so welcome and made those nights some of the best in my entire life with what is probably the best show I‚Äôve ever seen. However, to me, the tour was more than just the few hours I got to spend in a stadium with Taylor. Even if we were all stressed over getting tickets, Swifties still came together and organized projects and chants for Taylor during the tour. From the champagne problems cheer to the phone lights during marjorie, Swifties found a way to make the concert even more special than Taylor intended. When I was in the stadium, I got complimented on my outfit from a Swiftie who recognized the themes I was going for, and her words made me so incredibly happy. This community that Swifties have built extends far beyond just physically being at the concert, though. It became about the hours spent making friendship bracelets and trading them, about watching livestreams as the anticipation for surprise songs begins during Bad Blood, about playing Swiftball (even if I never won), and about the incredible people who I‚Äôve gotten to meet and talk to (both in person and virtually) because of this concert. So, to me, the magic of Eras Tour didn‚Äôt just come from the shows I went to‚Äîor any one show at all, really‚Äîit was about every experience I‚Äôve had (no matter how small) from when the show first started in Glendale, to now. I‚Äôve been a fan since 1989/Reputation, but this is the first tour that I‚Äôve truly been ‚Äúinvolved‚Äù in, and Swifties have just made it an incredible experience even for people not going to any show. I guess what I‚Äôm trying to say is that the reason the tour became even more incredible than I thought it would was because of the fans and the community Swifties have created. I‚Äôm really grateful to be a part of this community, and I‚Äôm so excited for the international leg of the tour!",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/15k3ddr/why_the_eras_tour_is_so_special_to_me/,Why the Eras Tour is so special to me,TaylorSwift,t3_15k3ddr,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/15k3ddr/why_the_eras_tour_is_so_special_to_me/,2023-08-06 23:00:09,Taylor Swift

I honestly feel like IBYTAM is on the level of All Too Well in the way that she... just... tears this man apart. Goddam. She's insane. I love it. The punch that each and every lyric in this song delivers is something to behold. 

Every time I listen to it I am just like, wtf?! this is literally the best song ever üò≠ and i'm not sure if it's 100% intended to be a country song (I am NOT a country music fan whatsoever), but if it is, I feel like it is THE perfect country song. And that is saying a lot, coming from me!

Anyway - Main point is I am almost fully confident that this song is on the same level of All Too Well TV, and the fact that they are on the same album is just a masterpiece.

I hear similarities sometimes when people make posts, but I‚Äôve heard songs that remind me of other songs my whole life. 

Another thing I‚Äôve noticed is that people will compare one of her songs to multiple other songs, but no one ever says that the other people are copying each other if that makes sense?

Assuming she releases reputation Taylor‚Äôs Version the same way as Speak Now and 1989 during surprise song o‚Äôclock with a song that represents the album, what song do you think she‚Äôd do for reputation?

When she played End Game I realized we‚Äôre running out of songs from reputation for surprise songs‚Ä¶kinda like how New Romantics was the only song 1989 she hadn‚Äôt played yet‚Ä¶.

"title. i feel like a lot of fans wonder why GUTS, though extremely successful, hasn‚Äôt quite been doing the same numbers that SOUR did in 2021. and I don‚Äôt think it has to do with the quality of the music or anything, but rather that the promotion of the ‚Äúsingles‚Äù has been kind of terrible. besides ‚Äúvampire‚Äù, not ONE other song from GUTS has received the ***FULL*** single treatment imo. sure, ‚Äúbad idea right?‚Äù and ‚Äúget him back!‚Äù also got music videos but the playlisting, radio and other marketing has not been there for those two tracks. I‚Äôd consider both of these songs to have been ‚Äúpromotional singles‚Äù rather than ‚Äúofficial singles‚Äù. This would mean that, so far, GUTS has had only 1 official single (vampire) and 2 promotional singles (bir? + ghb!). In comparison, SOUR had 4 official singles (drivers license, deja vu, good 4 u, traitor) and 1 promotional single (brutal). 

As it relates to live performances, besides ‚Äúvampire‚Äù, it seems that Olivia‚Äôs team is sort of just randomly choosing for Olivia to perform whatever songs may best represent/promote the album. ie. ‚Äúget him back!‚Äù at the VMAs, ‚Äúall-american bitch‚Äù on SNL + Vevo, ‚Äúballad of a homeschooled girl‚Äù on Jimmy Kimmel, ‚Äúlove is embarrassing‚Äù for Tiny Desk Concert. 

However, by the looks of it, ‚Äúall-american bitch‚Äù is the next GUTS track to receive a commercial push, which would bring the underwhelming marketing run of ‚Äúget him back!‚Äù to an equally underwhelming end. I am just really crossing my fingers that this song will be serviced as an official single and not merely a promotional single because so many songs from GUTS, including AAB, deserve to be known by everyone the same way that the 4 official SOUR singles were. 

What does everyone else think?",https://www.reddit.com/r/OliviaRodrigo/comments/18l27c4/has_vampire_been_the_only_official_single_from/,has ‚Äúvampire‚Äù been the only official single from GUTS?,OliviaRodrigo,t3_18l27c4,/r/OliviaRodrigo/comments/18l27c4/has_vampire_been_the_only_official_single_from/,2023-12-18 06:30:21,Olivia Rodrigo

"Went to the merch store recently and I was surprised by a few things‚Ä¶

1. The fabrics for the shirts and sweatshirts are so thick!!! They‚Äôre not soft either. I‚Äôve read on here that they are high quality though, so I‚Äôll see how my t shirt is after I wash it. 
2. The deck of cards‚Ä¶ Maybe I glanced at the display too quickly, but I thought there would be more photos‚Äînot just six. I was also a little disappointed that the back of the cards was the 30 album cover, rather than something generally Weekends with Adele themed (especially since the box says ‚ÄúADELE Vegas‚Äù). Speaking of the box, it is super thin and cheaply made. Seems like a lot for $25.
3. Not that this was super surprising, but items have not been restocked like the casino chip magnet, wine opener, bucket hat‚Ä¶ at least when I was there
4. My shopping bag handle broke within 10 minutes of carrying the bag around! Disappointing because it is a cute bag and the handle and bag material seem to be good but not well glued together. 
5. There is an option to tip cashiers when checking out. I think I‚Äôve seen this at a few shops /merch stores now, and I think tips may be warranted during super busy times but it still feels a bit weird to me to tip on merch.

Everything else seems to be on par with other posts here, but wondering if other people have also had disappointing experiences shopping at the Adele boutique.

"Disclaimer: this is not hate in anyway to Taylor or those who call midnights an era. 

I saw on twitter that Taylor should not release ‚ÄúSpeak Now TV‚Äù because it will ruin the ‚Äúmidnights era‚Äù which is her biggest in a decade. But would it though? When I think of eras I think of everything as a whole. Her lifestyle, clothing, interviews, performances, all of it together as a theme. The last time she did this was Lover which got cut short. Folklore kind of just because it was different and distinctive, but not to the caliber other ‚Äúeras‚Äù were. She hasn‚Äôt done a ton of promotions, no live performances, not many public appearances (including being seen out in public,) midnights doesn‚Äôt really feel like an ‚Äúera‚Äù and with the rerocordings, people make it seem like she‚Äôs redoing the era. Go back to similar outfits and styles she had at that time but not really. I saw it some with red, but it was very toned down and I don‚Äôt think very similar at all. I really thought she was entering an ‚Äúera‚Äù when she announced midnights because of the iconic looks she gave at the VMAs. But promotion for midnights is over. The looks aren‚Äôt very distinctive, I just don‚Äôt think eras are the same as they used to be, which is okay, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that. It‚Äôs just an observation. 




Also, I am so happy for her. I really feel like by not having ‚Äúeras‚Äù it shows she‚Äôs content and happy and confident. I know she values privacy and I‚Äôm happy she has that and doesn‚Äôt feel the need to promote with an ‚Äúera.‚Äù Or reinventing herself. She‚Äôs made it so big she has that luxury now. I think it‚Äôs a good sign. I just don‚Äôt think she goes through ‚Äúeras‚Äù anymore and wanted to get some other opinions on this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/101yezv/taylor_swift_is_done_with_eras/,Taylor Swift is done with ‚Äúeras‚Äù,TaylorSwift,t3_101yezv,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/101yezv/taylor_swift_is_done_with_eras/,2023-01-03 04:45:07,Taylor Swift

"Have you ever successfully converted a friend, family, *someone* to being a fan? I want to hear your stories! What album/song/circumstances convinced them?

I have a friend who never liked Taylor growing up. She didn't hate her or anything, but she definitely thought she didn't like her music.  Last fall I convinced her to listen to Midnights and she finally got into Taylor's music. She's not a huge fan, but she went from not considering herself a fan at all to saying she likes some of Taylors music.

I got my dad to kind of like her music, too. He's a huge fan of Cruel Summer and some other tracks, mostly her later pop albums (He doesn't like folklore/evermore, alas).

"The Production

The way he orchestrated the song

The build up! The way he divided the song thru different stages

The change of tempo

When the drums came in on the second chorus was soooooooo fucking satisfying

The grunge guitar, pads, piano, sound effects (1:09), mild violins

Olivia‚Äôs vocals was really different this time, I‚Äôm not sure if the effect is added saturation but it was painful to the ears (in a good way) especially on the ‚ÄòBloodsucker, fame fucker part‚Äù

The BRIDGEEEEEEEEE

"Just because a lot of us believe that Travis is real after him showing up in Argentina and getting a video of Taylor running to him backstage doesn't mean that those of us who think he's real don't believe in Gaylor anymore. We can gush over how cute he thier relationship is and still be gaylors because we can still believe Taylor is bi. 


Personally I've always believed that she was bi and I can't bring myself to think he's fake after that video. It just involves too much backbending now because the implication is fake now includes Taylor running a stage and jumping into his arms and kissing him and purposely having it recorded so it could get released. I just don't think that Taylor would remember to do all that just to try and sell is on a relationship.

NOT ONLY IS SHE RELEASING AT THE SAME TIME BUT SHES ALSO USING THE SAME COLORS AS MOTHER! THIS CANNOT BE.

HER SONG IS CALLED VAMPIRE BTW WHICH IS SO FITTING BECAUSE SHES ONLY SO SUCCESSFUL AS AN ARTIST BECAUSE SHE FEEDS OFF OF OTHER PEOPLES ART. REMEMBER CRUEL SUMMER AND MISERY BUSINESS? WELL I DO.

SHES ALSO CLEARLY COPYING MOTHER'S MARKETING SCHEMES. ITS SO SUSPICIOUS THAT SHE USED 5 H'S AND 7 !'S ON HER CAPTION ANNOUNCING THE SINGLE ON INSTAGRAM.

"I am a 24-years-old male and own my own record store here in Canada.

Last summer, I wrote a song by accident on my guitar just joking around trying to mimic Billie's style but it actually turned out amazing. Where do I post it or share it!? I know the odds of Billie ever wanting to record it, let alone hear it, are probably zero, but even just another (preferably female) artist who is inspired by Billie, I would love for someone more vocally talented than myself to record it and do their thing with it!!!!!! I think the potential truly lies in how creative you can make the production, like a Xanny sort of thing.

"Yeah I know, it's the weirdest combination of acts ever. Yet it has protentional. All three of them seem to get along well and have collaborated on Taylor's projects (the Bad Blood remix and Castles Crumbling). And while Kendrick is mostly known for his deep thought provoking songs, he does have a few that match the other two's style (some of the tracks off TPAB for example). 

Like just imagine: First Taylor opens with Ready for it? followed Blank Space, Cruel Summer, and maybe Anti Hero. Next Paramore comes out and go through a mix of their big hits like That's What You Get, Misery Business, Ain't it Fun and Hard Times; alongside some of Taylor more pop rock songs like State of Grace, Holy Ground, Better Than Revenge, and a duet of Castles Crumbling with Hayley Williams. Then finally Kendrick is brought on and performs ""I"" with Taylor and Hayley doing the backing vocals. He then goes through Swimming Pools, King Kunta, The Heart Part 5, maybe HUMBLE if you can stretch it. And the concert ends with all three of them singing the Bad Blood remix.

Again, one in a million chance of this actually happening, but it's fun to dream.

"We went to the 2/3 show this past Friday and it was such and amazing time! Definitely worth the wait. We (like many others who bought tickets during the original sale) had waited for so long and we‚Äôre finally glad to be there to see the show and sit by other awesome fans, dance, sing, cry and laugh.

I want to thank everyone in this group who provided tips, answered questions, and were there for support and venting when we were all so frustrated with what originally happened with cancellations then radio silence for so long. I‚Äôm glad I never caved in and got a refund - and maybe in the long run, the show we got was the best version because it was INCREDIBLE! 

Some final pointers/info for those who have still yet to go:

- Try to look at the merchandise online (from peoples past or recent posts) and decide what items you want. We went the Friday the Merch store opened and there was a line but we knew what we wanted, grabbed the items, and checked out quickly while others were still busy looking around. We got in and out in about 3 mins.

- This has been mentioned before but buy a poster tube if you plan to get the show poster. For me, the easiest was going to my local UPS they had a triangle shaped long packing box that worked excellent. 

- If you book dinner, book early at 4:30 or 5pm to give yourself plenty of time to eat and make it there in time. Location wise, these places are probably the radius you‚Äôd want to stay in for a closer walk to Caesar‚Äôs. The obvious choice (Caesar‚Äôs), Bellagio, Paris, Flamingo, Planet Hollywood, Cosmopolitan, and maybe Aria. We ate at Superfrico at the Cosmopolitan and it was excellent. 

- Those of you going Friday and plan on being in Vegas extra days I would opt to stay Wed/Thurs/Fri if you want to have a few days with less crowds. Wednesday &amp; Thursday it was much slower and nicer to walk around. Once Friday/Saturday hit it was noticeably busier and a lot more line waiting and crowds. 

- Lastly, and granted - everyone paid for tickets and will opt to experience the concert in their own way (so this is really just a recommendation) but try to not be on your phone the whole time and enjoy the show through your eyes and not the lens of your phone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/adele/comments/10wj095/amazing_show/,Amazing show!,adele,t3_10wj095,/r/adele/comments/10wj095/amazing_show/,2023-02-08 01:09:33,Adele

* They sang the Ditto remix at their fanmeeting, Bunnies Camp (here's a [fancam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmP8zrmqPr4))
* They performed what seems to be a sample of the OMG remix at the 2023 Asia Artist Awards (here's the [performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI-AtARfI7o))
* They played the Hype Boy remix instrumental in the background of their 2023 Bunnies Camp [VCR tape](https://twitter.com/bunniesupdates/status/1675073002734755842) which was shown in between performances 
* They played the Cookie remix instrumental in the background of a [promotional video](https://twitter.com/NewJeans_ADOR/status/1605895964442890240) for their Nudake Cake collaboration 
* The Hurt remix has been known (and loved) for a while since it was officially released as a [special video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uONSk48LW1A) on YouTube a while ago

I love how deliberately planned everything seems to be. The above listing is likely not even the only times they've played/performed these remixes. They have other remixes for these songs too that the girls have performed (their Lollapalooza remixes for example) that aren't in the remix album which is crazy lol

It would be fun for them to remix the Get Up EP and maybe the next comeback this time next year! I actually think it's likely. They've been [teasing](https://twitter.com/hurtsaz/status/1737057866123825663) a lot of Get Up remixes lately in performances and on social media so I think it's likely that there will be another remix album. I think (and hope) that they might do this every year where they tease remixes throughout the year, finally ending in a remix album like this one. 

Another interesting thing: The theme of the first Ditto hallway-running-scene was the number '6' and for this year (redone in different outfits and shoes) it's '7'. A korean fan was looking at the photos they released for NJWMX on NewJeans' website and was attempting to download them and noticed that there were photos with the numbers 1-35 embedded but number 8 was missing. The director of the Ditto MV (Shin Wooseok, who has directed several of their music videos) posted a picture of the number 8 on his Instagram, which is interesting. I'm thinking the '8' might come next year with the return Ban Heesoo and Ditto videos once again.

"Olivia Rodrigo was the breakout star of 2021 with the massive success of ""SOUR"" and breaking multiple streaming records and sales across platforms. Since, she has toured and is now working on her upcoming and highly anticipated second album. With a quick rise to fame and the subsequent comparisons to the likes of Taylor Swift, Paramore's Hayley Williams, and more, the follow up record to SOUR will be a defining moment in her career. Done right, her individuality as an artist should be solidified.

Personally, I believe SOUR's highlights are Jealousy, Jealousy, Happier, Good 4 u, and Deja Vu. All four songs showcase her versatility and songwriting chops at their very best. Moving forward, I hope Olivia continues to blend pop-rock, explores more experimental production, utilizes her emotional delivery, and veers from the diary style writing that made songs like ""Hope Your Ok"", ""Enough for You"", and ""1 step forward, 3 steps back"" the more forgettable songs on the album.

I would love to see her unabashed love for greats like Jack White, Fiona Apple, Alanis Morissette, and The Cure to be demonstrated more clearly in this upcoming album. Of course, adding nuance and fresh takes to not copy but find inspiration.

I find her more gritty and concise (less storytelling) lyricism to be Olivia at her peak. Her lyrics feel most inspired when she delves into more messy emotions. Her voice also feels right at home during these times. With pop-punk making its comeback, I hope she is not pushed into an album full of Paramore style songwriting and production. Even though Good 4 U is an instant classic, the bratty teenage heartbreak of the song should be used as a stepping stone to create more mature &amp; well-rounded, but, equally as cutting songs like Fiona Apple's ""I Want You to Love Me"".

The most natural progression, in my eyes, is really honing in on her ability to write lyrics like ""I'm happy for them but then again, I'm not"" and ""you will never have to hurt the way you know that I do"" The intensity in her delivery during those moments is what gives those songs the gut-punch they want to achieve.

So far, she has proved her singing ability has improved, as seen in her rock Hall of Fame cover performance of ""You're So Vain"". Atop that, I hope this means she is really taking notes from Carly Simon and Alanis Morissette on how to nail that candid, ""take it or leave it"" style of singing and writing they have mastered.

All in all, Olivia is set to release this year, and I, for one, am amped to see her progression from SOUR. I see so much potential in her as a fresh voice in pop music, and I am rooting for her to prove her longevity in the genre this year!

"170,000 tickets

# Record advance sale of Taylor Swift tickets

**On Tuesday, the pre-sale for the three Taylor Swift concerts as part of the ""Eras"" tour in August 2024 began. Those who won the bid after the registration process cheered on the short message service Twitter - even if the cheapest standing room tickets cost 100 euros. In the run-up, there were still hectic attempts to sell and exchange pre-codes. According to initial reports from fans, the pre-sale went off without a hitch.**

Around 170,000 tickets for three concerts in a row: that's a Vienna record. Those who had pre-registered by 23 June were selected on Tuesday, with a little luck, to be allowed to buy a ticket for the three dates on 8, 9 and 10 August 2024. Until the last second, people tried to exchange or sell presale codes via social networks - although it was not even clear whether that was possible.

You pay 99.90 euros for a standing room, 179.80 euros for a standing room right at the front of the stage, between 69.40 and 211.45 euros for seats in eleven categories and 512.75 euros for a ""hospitality package"" including a good seat, buffets and drinks. Quite apart from the price, ticket sales already caused debate in the run-up.

**Arrival only in the group of buyers**

For example, the buyer must be present at the concert entrance of everyone for whom he or she has bought tickets. One person could buy up to four tickets. All persons are checked with a photo at the concert entrance. If someone has bought four tickets, he or she must be present at the entrance with the other three along with their ID.

This is apparently to prevent tickets from being resold afterwards at horrendous prices. Of course, this is not practical for fans. By the way, the third date was booked by the organisers only a week ago - due to the huge number of fans who had registered for tickets in June.

**Rejoicing among those who get hold of tickets**

The reaction of those who were able to get a ticket shows that the Swift concerts in Vienna are an exceptional event. The corresponding jubilant postings in social networks are proof of this. A researcher from the Finnish Oulu University, for example, tweeted: ""A teenage dream is coming true next year - got tickets to Taylor Swift's concert in Vienna"". Immediately afterwards she asked for help in another post: ""Anyone have a map of the stadium at Vienna? I got tickets (yay!) but have no idea where they are located"".

Another user, on the other hand, can probably retire as a father: He has achieved everything there is to achieve - and got hold of standing tickets directly in front of the stage for 180 euros each for his daughters.

**15 minutes on hold**

The field report of an [ORF.at](https://ORF.at) editorial team member shows that the ticket purchase was quite lengthy and exciting, but also went off without a hitch. First the registration in June, then the anxious wait for the 12.00 noon appointment on Tuesday. Until the very end, it was not clear whether everyone who registered would get a ticket.

From 12.00 p.m. onwards, the [ORF.at](https://ORF.at) editorial team was then in the official queue - classic with a bar that slowly filled up - only 15 minutes later there was the opportunity to buy a ticket. The good seats were already taken on the third date, but there was still enough for third row at 119.99 euros.

Meanwhile, the queuing system didn't work so well in France - there the bar got stuck and didn't move for anyone. The pre-sale day had to be cancelled and postponed indefinitely.

**Fixed prices in the USA no longer fixed**

With Swift, there are fixed prices for tickets that can be used as a guide. In the USA, however, the industry giant Ticketmaster is now causing annoyance among concertgoers at many events with a new pricing system, as reported by dpa. There, demand determines ticket prices for many artists, comparable to the principle followed by airlines and hotels. Prices for tickets, which normally cost around 100 US dollars, can then easily rise to 300 US dollars if many fans want to order tickets at the same time at the start of sales.

The system is setting a precedent. Organisers of concerts by Harry Styles, Coldplay and the Korean band Blackpink, for example, have also raised prices in Great Britain in line with demand. On social networks, many fans reacted indignantly to the sometimes astronomical amounts. ""Basically, you have no right to expect every ticket to cost the same,"" said the German Consumer Advice Centre. Anyone who wants to go to a concert is at the mercy of the intransparent procedure. But there is one tip: ""If you want to have the ticket, you can at least look on different end devices at the same time and compare if you find a cheaper price somewhere.""

"Hello, you guys, this is update 1: 

I'm doing this map of a Taylor's World. By now I have three islands:

\-Real Island: London, Paris, High Watch (The Harkness House), Big Sur, The Getaway Motel, Samuel Goldy State (Tay's house in LA), Upstate (All too well forest), Coney Island, And the places of NY (Tribeca, Cornelia st, The bar from Delicate, The sisters House from All too well, Upstate). 

&amp;#x200B;

\-Magical Island: India (For Seven Lyrics), The castle of Bejeweld and the long pond studio near because is in the video like this. Willow's Village, The Safari (Wildest Dreams), Ivy's House, The woods and the Blank Space House

Also the Lover's house but in the mini island, near than anything to the lakes. 

\- The lakes Island: I think is like Neverland, so I made it far far away, 

\---------

\-New york and High Watch are in front of each other like the houses on The Great Gatsby. 

\- a Evil Snake for the anti-heroe

\- I put the river in the Magical Island connecting The studio and the Willow's and Cardigans Sea, BUT, I dont know where should I put the Highschool for James, August and Betty.

Make suggestions as you please, I'm happy to read.

"With Vampire still doing well on streaming and radio, I feel like the second and third singles, ‚ÄòBad Idea Right?, and ‚ÄòGet Him Back!‚Äô shouldn‚Äôt have been released so soon. 

Bad Idea Right should have been released in September with Get Him Back preceding the album in November. This would have left more room for the singles to breathe and each shine. 

Drivers Licence came four months before the album  similar to the gap between Vampire and GUTS if the latter was released in November instead. 

Lastly, this means GUTS would compete for AOTY at the 2025 Grammys instead and have a higher chance of getting the award.

"around like a year ago, i had just gotten out of a toxic friend group where it was full of backstabbers. ever since those few months, ive had trust issues and i thought everyone was backstabbing me because the friend group i got out of had a really big group of friends so almost everyone knew them.  
i really felt like i had no one to trust or become true friends with, it was until i found a group of friends that i knew werent part of that huge toxic crowd of backstabbers. ive never been so happy with friends, they make me feel like im actually apart of something.   


when i found out about ditto and newjeans, i wasnt in that new friend group yet. but when i relistened to the song and watched their music video, it reminds me of them. im also the type of friend to document funny moments like when someone makes a funny joke and everyone laughs, i just start recording it so we can have something to look back on in the future so i guess i have something similar to ban heesoo. it makes me kind of cry because my family are planning to move out the country soon and i know my friend group and i wont be able to see each other much anymore, even online with all the timezone problems. i remember i talked to them about watching the ditto mv and i couldnt help but bawl my eyes out in front of them, and it didnt help that they started hugging and comforting me.  


im happy i got to connect with newjeans and their music, i guess one reason i love them is how i see me and my friends in the members. this was just something i wanted to share and get off my chest, and id like to know if other people had similar experiences.",https://www.reddit.com/r/NewJeans/comments/17ec54l/ditto_reminds_me_of_my_friends/,ditto reminds me of my friends,NewJeans,t3_17ec54l,/r/NewJeans/comments/17ec54l/ditto_reminds_me_of_my_friends/,2023-10-23 04:28:16,New Jeans

I'm a fan of both Charli XCX and Ariana Grande, and I know this is silly, but I'm very excited about coincidences and fun facts.

1- Ariana's character in Don't Look Up, Riley Bina has a fanbase called 'Vroom Vroom Army'. Charli XCX has released an EP in 2016 called 'Vroom Vroom', which has a song called 'Vroom Vroom' (An absolute favorite!). She even says 'vroom-vroom' in a 2022 song called 'Hot Girls (Bodies Bodies Bodies)'.

2 - Ariana has portrayed a girl named 'Charlotte' in 13: The Musical. Well, guess what, Charli XCX's actual name is Charlotte. I can't post pictures of this character because Ariana was under 18 at that time. (Gladly I read the sub rules before posting it, this is my first post here)

3 - Both Ariana and Charli have collabed with Iggy Azalea in 2014. Iggy Azalea was featured in Ariana Grande's 'Problem' and Charli XCX was featured in Iggy Azalea's 'Fancy'.

Ari and Charli have very different vibes, but as I said I love them both and I'm enthralled by coincidences.",https://i.redd.it/wnq6ozwjxk7b1.png,Similarities to Charli XCX,ArianaGrande,t3_14g50n5,/r/ArianaGrande/comments/14g50n5/similarities_to_charli_xcx/,2023-06-22 14:27:43,Ariana Grande
"(I‚Äôm not a vinyl expert, pls correct me if I‚Äôm wrong abt anything) It seems like there is a brand new version of Lover out on vinyl this week, and it‚Äôs an all black pressing. From what I can tell nobody‚Äôs seen these before, some people on the Taylor swift Vinyl subreddit didn‚Äôt believe the OP when they posted a picture of a store selling them, they thought it was fake. Others claim it is being pressed on black like a classic vinyl as it has the best sound quality, others say, with technology these days, different colored vinyl sounds exactly the same. I‚Äôm wondering, how many albums, at least recently, has Taylor specifically released a black pressing of? 

Fans have been confused and said things such as ‚Äú‚ÄúLover is a pink album for me, a black pressing just feels wrong‚Äù‚Äù.

"With this being Taylor's 6th tour we've got some clear favourites that get performed on every or nearly every tour (namely Love Story, You Belong With Me, WANEGBT, Blank Space, Style, Bad Blood, Shake It Off, ...Ready For It?, LWYMMD, Delicate and Don't Blame Me). What songs from both the represented albums and Lover, folklore, evermore and Midnights would you add to this list?

From the new albums I'd say:
Cruel Summer, The Man, YNTCD, TLGAD, Willow, Champagne Problems, Lavender Haze,  Anti-Hero, Bejeweled and Karma

And from the older albums:

I emailed them about cancellation and getting a refund and they said: ‚ÄúIf you would like to cancel your order, we will charge a processing fee of 6.9% of the order value + $1 per cancellation policy. We will refund to you after your confirmation. If you change your mind, we'll send a small gift with your order. Thank you very much for your understanding.‚Äù

"Hi Swifties,

Backstory: I recently started liking TS when midnights came out because it was commercial and the music was fun. Never was a fan/stan but liked her radio hits. Once Eras Tour kicked off I saw some videos and knew this was a tour I wanted to see as it looked nostalgic and I can relive my highschool memories of those songs with my highschool friends. Bought 4 VIP tickets to Sydney show so I‚Äôm excited to see her for the first time in concert (don‚Äôt hate full swifties who didnt get tickets)

So I decided to listen to her albums to make sure I know the songs and feel of each Era and started with Folklore. 

Wow, this Album made me feel things I didnt want to hear. Favourites were Cardigan, Exile, This is me trying.

Definately gave me anew found respect for TS, and also made me feel sorry for her to go through what she went through making that album haha.

Going to start listening to Evermore tomorrow as I listen on my train to work (45min) so I am excited to see how that makes me feel. Kinda cheated as I was reading reddit posts about Folklore vs Evermore and people said that Evermore feels like drinking tea compared to cold water lol. 

Once I‚Äôm done I will make a new thread about it :) let me know if there is anything I should watch / listen to before the tour",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/14nljv1/first_time_listening_to_folklore_review/,First time listening to Folklore Review,TaylorSwift,t3_14nljv1,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/14nljv1/first_time_listening_to_folklore_review/,2023-07-01 04:29:44,Taylor Swift

"Red has always been that girl. I remember when it came out I was so shocked at the lyrical content. Her lyricism in this album is absolutely beautiful. We always talk about folklore and evermore and although I adore those albums, the lyricism in red is just overlooked.

Here‚Äôs some of my favorite lyrics:

‚ÄòWe are alone with our changing minds, we fall in love til it hurts or bleeds.. or fades in time‚Äô

‚ÄòTime is taking it‚Äôs sweet time erasing you, and you‚Äôve got your demons and darling they all look like me‚Äô

‚ÄòPut your lips close to mine, as long as they don‚Äôt touch.. out of focus, eye to eye - til the gravity‚Äôs too much‚Äô have you ever heard of anyone explaining kissing like that?

‚ÄòWe blocked the noise with the sound of I need you, and for the first time I had something to lose‚Äô

‚ÄòWords how little they mean when you‚Äôre a little too late‚Äô



Like she was 21 when she wrote most of this album. 21!!! It‚Äôs just amazing. It makes me so sad people always put this so low down in the ranking.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/186af60/red_was_so_ahead_of_its_time_and_so_underrated/,Red was so ahead of it‚Äôs time and so underrated,TaylorSwift,t3_186af60,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/186af60/red_was_so_ahead_of_its_time_and_so_underrated/,2023-11-28 23:32:26,Taylor Swift

"I love NewJeans soooo much. I wanna talk about them with likeminded people , hype ourselves up for every small thing they do, get excited for comebacks, what concepts they're gonna do, what variety content we will get, what social media updates they share everyday, talk about the girls sweet relationships with each other nd their personalities.. Just all in all be a fan nd have a kind community to be part of. 

This sub is exactly that. We r growing sooo fast as a community, everyone is kind nd welcoming, we all have our girls best interests at heart, we wanna go on a journey along with the girls being their fans nd make good memories.

I'm happy to see posts talking about the girls skills nd everyone discussing it in a mature way nd not being toxic ( yk that's hard to find in many other kpop fandoms). Posts appreciating all the members ( love whoever did the hyein ditto humming part appreciation post ‚ù§). 

Honestly at first I was put off with how there was a lot of negativity surrounding newjeans in other subs that I was sad there wasn't a place for me to share my love for the girls. But this sub put all those worries to rest. I always visit this sub at the end of the day before going to bed to check all the updates, posts etc it's becoming a daily routine atp.

"Seriously she could've easily idk not answered their questions? does she know what outing actually means lol. It's not like variety found photos of her making out with someone or recorded a conversation and leaked it... girl things you said yourself while on the record isn't ""outing"" and after years of her specifically trying to garner and use the gay community to her advantage by queerbaiting yet dating homophobes, this is ridiculous. Her saying she's ""attracted to females"" isn't even coming out it's giving ""i'd kiss a girl but I could never date one"" just because she's trying to be quirky, unique and different and say ""girls are intimidating"" as an excuse as to why she doesn't date them lol. As someone who's bisexual I actually can't stand her and this whole situation is making me angry that people are acting like she can do no wrong and saying variety did indeed out her, or that she is bisexual. She isn't labelling anything so she can feed into peoples para social relationship with her so people can be delusional and feed into their little crushes on her.

I already know i'll get downvoted for this, but it needed to be said and can't believe she'd date a homophobe and then act like she was outed for something she said during a literal interview.

Outing has severe and real consequences for people, who can be kicked out of homes, bullied, etc. She has pretty privilege and is famous, I find it pretty messed up to accuse a magazine out outing for a question they asked and she answered while literally smiling and laughing lol. So of course she's using the word ""outing"" to her advantage for more publicity, when her ""coming out"" would only boost her publicly, the fact she said to stream her song in the same line as accusing them of outing her says everything.",https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/18anhtm/billie_eilish_was_not_outed/,Billie Eilish was not outed,popheads,t3_18anhtm,/r/popheads/comments/18anhtm/billie_eilish_was_not_outed/,2023-12-04 16:10:53,Billie Eilish

After hearing Is It Over Now?, this line takes on an additional/new meaning. She kept her nights out of sight, so it seems kind of vindictive, revealing like 'oh, you thought you were the only one seeing other people'? (and that yes, she still thinks of him anyway)

"I love Taylor so much. I‚Äôve been a massive fan for 15 years. Seeing the Eras show this year was one of the most fun nights of my life, especially being with so many people who love her music as much as I do. I‚Äôm proud of her.

But I, along with millions of young people, have spent the last two months watching a genocide on my phone. I wake up every day hoping that young journalists, like Motaz or Hind or Bisan are still alive. They have risked their lives and completely disrupted mainstream media, exposing so much that was misrepresented on TV by our elders. They brought millions of people into the streets to protest. The reason so many young people, especially young Jewish people, have broken from their elders is because they had the opportunity to see the truth with their own eyes. Over 60% of Gaza‚Äôs housing units are damaged or destroyed. I see it in the photos. 1000 children have been amputated. I have seen them. 77 journalists have died. We watch them mourn their colleagues. 1.9 million people are displaced, and surviving on pieces of bread. We have watched them walk under gunfire. And we have seen the more than 15,000 dead, every day for two months. 

During the eras tour in the US, I‚Äôd wake up in the morning and look up what the special song was and text my friends. Today I wake up checking if Motaz and Bisan are still alive and I  call my senators. These young people are my heroes and they are the people who have made the greater impact on me this year and forever. Bisan is 25. Plestia is 22. Motaz is 24. Hind is 28.

So I feel as if the photoshoot, the nomination, all of it, no longer fits the moment so many of us young people are living in. I love Taylor, but I‚Äôm praying for peace over any new album or concert tickets this year. I wish the Time cover had represented that. I wish Taylor would use her platform for that.

"***Sorry for the boring title name, I didn't want to make it too exaggerated. I also wrote a lot in this post, if you have low attention span, I apologize.***

Firstly I'd like to say that this is supposed to be constructive critique, I'm not here to bad mouth NewJeans or anything. I truly love all of their songs, and from a music producer lens, I love how they grab influences from genres or sounds that are less heard in Korea let alone KPOP. (All I can think of when listening to Hypeboy is Kaytranada). I do have some issues with OMG (MV+song) but overall in the grand scheme of things, NewJeans truly have been consistently innovative and strong in their vision. This post is all about love and the reason why I wrote this is because I want them to be the best they can be and by formulating the things that I believe they can improve on, I feel is a big defense against nonconstructive criticism from randos on the internet because (hopefully) through this post, people can then find their own words to fully articulate themselves and their opinions better.

Also I'm aware that I'm mostly speaking to a brick wall since this is Reddit and I'm not in front of the producers of NewJeans discussing with them or anything although if there's an off-chance that an ADOR/HYBE employee just happens to stumble upon this post, then please hear me out.

*(Btw I'm not going to discuss about whether or not there's a good/bad message in the story itself. Imma just let ADOR cook since that's not what my critique is focusing on).*  


So briefly, what did they do well with OMG?   


Well its a good song. I love the chord progression, the synths, the drums, it sounds modern, the song is well written with a really good topline melody (big props to the songwriters for this song and their other songs that came before). There are a couple of things that I have problems with but I'll mention that later on in the post.

The MV and its cinematography is undeniably more or less well directed and I guess this new film/camera director (which I'm not familiar with) has kdrama chops, we saw that with Ditto as well. It honestly feels very big budget mostly because of the acting. For some reason I was thinking that they had to take acting lessons for these MVs lol. 

Having said all that, OMG has some major pacing issues which I cannot gloss over.   


I think an amazing thing that ADOR did with their recent story-based MVs (Attention/Hypeboy) is that I could pretty much understand and conceptualize what the world they inhibit is about, what the characters in the MV are, the motivations and emotions that they harbor. Essentially there was a great sense of world building which made it compelling thanks to the great shots and the directing. I.E with Hypeboy I could immediately understand what was going on with the story, there was always a thread that you were able to follow even though it's all compact and compressed into a 3min+ video and I say this for all the member versions. Close-shots of vital facial expressions, angles that forces you to hone in on certain characters/objects, all of these little directing tricks brought clarity and helped amplify key parts of the story. Not to mention the animations which weaved in and out which acted as a transition for the chorus, bonus points for that flex. 

Small things like these truly made Hypeboy what it was.

&amp;#x200B;

For OMG I don't think I can say the same thing.   
There's a sense of erratic-ness that emanates from the whole video that I did not expect going in and I honestly had very high expectations. The beginning part of the video is really interesting and compelling and they don't do a ton of expos√© dumping which naturally makes you expect things to be clarified throughout the rest of the MV.   
But it turns out whether or not they accomplished in telling that rest of the story (which I had trouble following) it's still too convoluted and confusing to actually properly digest in one go let alone twice. Paired that with a song structure which is a little unusual, having a verse which acts as a ""pre-chorus"" into the chorus but not having a clear indication that that is the pre-chorus (verse 1B), it makes it all a bit too much to handle and it's hard to keep up with the structure. 

*(I understand that in especially western songwriting, you don't actually differentiate that much nor do you usually have a pre-chorus that leads into the actual chorus but I think they needed that for OMG. In Hypeboy they made the outline explicitly clear with Hyein followed by Minji and you get a sense of* ***""it's going to drop at this moment!""****).*

There's also a sense of things being constant with no change in the song because of how long the first chorus feels. Correct me if I'm wrong but it seems like there's 8+8+8 bars for the first chorus which is odd to me. A initial chorus followed by a post-A and a post-B when most would just opt for only one post-chorus, it feels **very long**. Then you also have the verse 2 which feels **short** and again there's the same issue of the faint outline before it transitions to the chorus. I don't feel like the **""he's the one that's living in my system baby!""** is doing a good enough job at easing the listener into the chorus to be very honest. 

Circling back to the MV as well, when the 2nd chorus hits, the visual impact is not provided by the MV and again it feels like I'm wallowing in ambiguity of how to feel as I'm at this point a little lost in the structure and arrangement. I could also feel that the director might've not been that experienced in providing good shots of choreography as the shots that were shown didn't show a lot of the interesting parts of the dance nor did they linger long enough for it to make an impact (every Haerin shot getting cut in odd places I.e. Why?).   
But thankfully I think they did a good job with the bridge into the final chorus both sonically (I appreciate the buildup from the bridge into the final chorus) and visually because of how they showcased the last choreo part and the throwback to the sets from Ditto, which gave off a good sense of ""resolution"" in the end.  


Anyways, why am I even giving this long list of feedback? 

Well as mentioned before the pacing is very off this time around and it's so noticeable and apparent that my gut feeling is telling me that that many first time listeners and even long time listeners of NewJeans will be thrown off and not in a good way. I do think they did a good job of having really strong creative elements, so for the MV, incredible cinematography which is drama level, the song has strong musical elements with super smooth synth chords and I love the chorus vocals that Hanni + Danielle sings (whoever wrote that top-line, good job). 

Unfortunately it is undeniable that the MV is convoluted and with how the song interacts with the MV. The disconnect exists which you can't ignore and the structure + parts of the arrangement sometimes feels like a speed-bump which kinda hampers the potential of the song. Not to mention the possible listeners that will write this off inevitably because of having to repeat watch an MV to grasp the story. With Hypeboy I did not have this problem and I could gladly watch it once and walk away with a compelling story etched in my mind. Also as I'm writing this I'm now aware that a couple of performance videos are out for OMG and I can't help but think that if they took more shots from those sets it'd look better because of how they shot the choreo in those videos.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, OMG is **good**. The vocal melodies they provided to these girls are really well written. The cinematography is really nice looking. So I implore ADOR, Min Heejin, HYBE, or whomever, to be a little more careful to not clutter the amazing ideas they already have. The MV with the odd shots, exposition that doesn't really clarify the story and then the song with an odd-ball structure that makes first time listeners ""lost in the sauce"". 

First impressions are truly everything and that's the only reason I'm here today and listening to NewJeans, because of the impact their songs and MVs had not just on me but really the whole of South Korea. There's goodwill out there for NewJeans and people want the best for them. Now this one speed-bump is not enough to make them falter obviously but why risk it? 

All in all, I wish the best for them because honestly they're really one of the few interesting girl groups out there at the moment. And the vocals, man. It's been a while since I've heard a GG sing melodies like these. (Those Ditto vocals resides in my hall of fame.)

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR**

I feel like the MV and the song is a little convoluted and its a bit hard to follow the first couple of times. There are definitely things they can avoid since their initial creative ideas for both the song and MV is already very strong. Hopefully they're able to remedy this next time since this might give off a not so good impression since they've had such hot streak of amazing roll-outs.",https://www.reddit.com/r/NewJeans/comments/105gfrt/some_critiques_about_omg_and_the_importance_of/,Some critiques about OMG and the importance of pacing.,NewJeans,t3_105gfrt,/r/NewJeans/comments/105gfrt/some_critiques_about_omg_and_the_importance_of/,2023-01-07 05:05:26,New Jeans

"There's three separate auctions for these fake Tear Drops on my Guitar 7 inch records on Shopgoodwill. The bid is already up to $3,000 on all three of the auctions. However, these are fake/bootleg copies. The real 7 inch debut era pressings are numbered on the back out of 5000. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fake records end up at goodwill all of the time so always beware when bidding on something for such a high price without a confirmation that it's authentic. Also considering how limited and rare this vinyl is just think about how likely it is for a random goodwill to have 135 sealed copies out of 5000. 

&amp;#x200B;

The bidders are more than likely scalpers considering this is labeled as a ""reseller lot"", so keep an eye out in the coming weeks for a flood of bootleg copies of this album! Be safe on shop goodwill guys lately it's been mostly fake signatures and bootleg vinyls, and they've been caught multiple times using bots to make popular auctions even more expensive. High key feels like they support scalper culture.

The lights are so bright

Interpretation:
She's new to the city, she's encountering the lights of the city ‚Äî the scale, the scrutiny, the game ‚Äî and making an almost bravado-like statement that she can keep up with it.

Is It Over Now lyrics:
""And did you think I didn't see you? There were flashing lights""

Interpretation:
She has lived up to the promise and flash of 'Welcome to New York' and even gone beyond it. Not only does she coexist with 'the lights', they are a tool/force that she can work with. The lights inform her. Obviously this is a paparazzi metaphor but paired with that is the idea of fame, being watched, being scrutinised. I think by the time this song rolls around 'the lights' have become an integrated, though not necessarily benevolent, part of her life, and she has gotten to the point where she scrutinises others. In a way, through this song's POV she BECOMES the blinding lights.

"In anticipation of 1989 (Taylor's Version), I was listening to Clean, followed by one of my favorite vault tracks, You All Over Me (feat. Maren Morris) (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault), and Fearless (Taylor's Version), and I was shocked by how many parallels there are between the three songs and the references to water (in various forms) in all three songs.

**Fearless**

*There's somethin' 'bout the way*  
*The street looks when it's just rained*  
*There's a glow off the pavement*

Fearless documents the beginning of a new relationship, the heady rush of emotions after an amazing first date, the anticipation of something and someone new. The use of the word ""glow"" implies something positive; the rain came, drenching the pavement, cleaning it of all the gunk and dirt, making it ""glow"". The rain falling on the pavement gives the illusion of a blank slate, washing away past scars and dirt; the relationship feels like the beginning of something shiny and new. 

*And I don't know why but with you I'd dance*  
*In a storm in my best dress, fearless*

Storms are negative; they imply chaos, destruction and discomfort. Her feelings for her date are so strong that she's unafraid to do something that would ordinarily make her uneasy. She doesn't mind dancing in her best dress in the middle of a storm that could be chaotic and violent.

**You All Over Me**

*Once the last drop of rain*  
*Has dried off the pavement*  
*Shouldn't I find a stain?*   
*But I never do*

Her use of rain as a metaphor here is pretty different from the previous song. In Fearless, the rain was welcome. It cleansed everything it touched. Here, she equates rain with leaving a stain behind, something that leaves an indelible mark on everything it touches, quite like the relationship that ended. 

*The way the tires turn stones*  
*On old country roads*  
*They leave it muddy underneath*  
*Reminds me of you*

She uses ""muddy"" as a metaphor for the hurt she's experiencing. The past relationship has left a sour taste in her mouth. If the beginning of the relationship felt like a pavement that the rain washed clean, the end of the relationship reminds her of a muddy road. 

*But no amount of freedom gets you clean*  
*I've still got you all over me*

This is a clear parallel for the clean, blank slate feeling in the previous song versus how she feels the relationship has left a stain on her, her heart, body and memories. She mourns the feeling of feeling ""clean"" and feels there are marks on her that she can't scrub off. She's almost resigned to the fact that these feelings will stay with her. 

**Clean**

*The drought was the very worst*  
*When the flowers that we'd grown together*   
*Died of thirst*

Droughts are long and tough, associated with thirst and heat. Water implies something essential and life-giving; without it (if there's a drought), there is death. The relationship died because something that was essential to it was not provided, and the relationship died as a result.

*You're still all over me*  
*Like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore*

This line sounds very similar to You All Over Me. The relationship and the marks it left stay with her. It has ruined and tarnished things, like the dress she can't wear anymore. 

*Hung my head as I lost the war*  
*And the sky turned black like a perfect storm*

Unlike in ""Fearless"", where the relationship gave her the strength to face a storm and dance in it, she hangs her head in resignation when the storm comes. There is no dancing this time. 

*Rain came pouring down*  
*When I was drowning*  
*That's when I could finally breathe*  
*And by morning, gone was any trace of you*  
*I think I am finally clean*

The use of the word ""drowning"" here is very interesting. She has presumably been drowning in grief due to the end of the relationship. When someone drowns, they die because they can't breathe. But here, she can breathe only when the rain comes when she is drowning due to her emotions. The rain has the same cleansing effect she references in Fearless. It makes her feel clean, just when she sang about how ""unclean"" she felt in You All Over Me when she couldn't scrub the effects the relationship left on her.

*Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you*  
*The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud*  
*But no one heard a thing*

The flood (from the heavy rain) here is washing away her memories of this person who hurt her, doubling down on the cleansing effect it has. In the second line, ""water"" is not used to describe the rain that poured down; it is a metaphor for the grief she references in the previous verse, the grief that drowned her. The grief and hurt filled her lungs and she screamed (presumably for help), but no one heard her. She has been carrying the weight of this break up for a long time, and it has been a heart-wrenching, isolating experience for her. 

*Ten months sober, I must admit*  
*Just because you're clean, don't mean you don't miss it*  
*Ten months older, I won't give in*  
*Now that I'm clean, I'm never gonna risk it*

Lots of references to drug abuse, addiction and recovery here. ""Clean"" is used as a metaphor for being free of substances. This is an indication that the relationship was not healthy. My interpretation is that she indicates she was anxiously attached and misses the chaos and the high highs and low lows that come with a turbulent relationship. However, she is older now and knows better, and knows that pursuing a turbulent relationship like that doesn't bring you peace. 

The three songs put together tell a complete, full circle story of falling for someone, mourning the relationship and feeling like you'd never move on, to finally finding peace and moving on.

"Over my teenage years I've been shown and began to interact with K-pop a couple times, but it never really clicked with me. I'd look up some stuff about it for maybe a week, and then would never think about it again.

Recently though, I found NewJeans and something about them made me really fond of the group. I enjoy the music, but am mostly interested in the variety content. If I were to guess, it's probably a mix of how most of them are about my age, and how much English is present in their content, as well as just their whole theme appealing to me.

On top of that, and more related to the topic in the title, they all felt more natural, free, and happy than other K-pop groups I interacted with. There was always someone who didn't look like they wanted to be there, friendships being forced, the artists being uncomfortable, or just looking straight-up tired -- For NewJeans, this was very much the opposite. From an outside perspective, they all seem to really enjoy eachother's company, they seem to have more time to themselves and general freedom, ane they all seem to respect eachother's boundaries, staff included, to keep everyone comfortable. It just felt like a group of friends enjoying their dream, rather than a group of people who went in expecting a dream and ended up tired, somewhat unhappy, but famous.

What's the point of the post, then? The point is the following: Am I incorrect in my assumptions and NewJeans is actually just the same as every other group, or am I correct in thinking what was mentioned above? If they are like most other groups, are there any things that you've felt differentiate NewJeans specifically?

I'd like to point out that I do understand that NJ still have an insane work/life schedule, they still struggle a lot like every other group, whether it be physically or mentally, and they still experience a lot of the ""dark sides"" of the K-pop industry -- I am in no way saying they don't, I just believe NewJeans seems to be a step in the right direction for the quality of idol's lives.",https://www.reddit.com/r/NewJeans/comments/15tdtpc/in_what_ways_is_newjeans_different_to_or_the_same/,"In what ways is NewJeans different to, or the same as, other groups?",NewJeans,t3_15tdtpc,/r/NewJeans/comments/15tdtpc/in_what_ways_is_newjeans_different_to_or_the_same/,2023-08-17 05:21:28,New Jeans

"As we bid farewell to 2023, which has thankfully been a really successful year for our girlies, I thought it'd be nice if we all put down our predictions for next year and then we can come back to them at the end of 2024 to see if we were right. 

I'll start with some of my own: 

\- A collab with another artist (within the kpop sphere or the west) 

\- Some more variety show appearances 

\- Hopefully a full album of atleast 10 songs (I BEG üò≠üò≠) 

\- Longer songs with bridges because the jeanies have majestic vocals (side note: do we have a collective name for the girls yet? If not, ""jeanies"" is my formal submission)

\- Attending and being nominated at more major US award shows (e.g VMAs) 

\- Even more daesangs, PAKS and other record-breaking achievements in SK

\- A WORLD TOUR (pls come to the UK)

\- And this last one might be a bit too ambitious but a grammy nom? (a girl can dream üòå)

" I know it has been discussed on this sub quite a lot in the years since *Future Nostalgia* dropped, but with the lead single seemingly right around the corner, I thought I'd organize all the information we have so far from Dua herself, collaborators, and 'inside sources' (taken with a grain of salt, of course) on her forthcoming third album. 

**Collaborators** 

This is an incomplete list of the songwriters, producers, and artists she's been seen with during the production process. (Not all will necessarily appear on the album, probably not all who will appear have been seen.) 

*Return Collaborators*

* Andrew Wyatt
* Watt (*Break My Heart, Prisoner*) 
* Ali Tamposi
* Caroline Ailin
* Jeff Bhasker (*Future Nostalgia*) 
* Mark Ronson (*Dance The Night, Electricity*) \[Although this could've been only for Dance The Night\]
* Sarah Hudson (*Levitating, Physical*) 
* Emile Haynie
* Koz
* Ian Kirkpatrick *(New Rules, Don't Start Now*) 
* Grades (*No Goodbyes*)
* Tove Lo (*Cool, Bordeline*)

*New Collaborators*

* Danny L Harle
* Tobias Jesso Jr. 
* Kevin Parker
* Caroline Polachek

Caroline joined Dua as an opener for her Future Nostalgia Tour, while the three writer/producers have been seen with Dua multiple times throughout the recording process. 

**Information**

*From Dua Herself*

‚ÄúI‚Äôve done a big chunk of writing: It‚Äôs starting to take shape; I‚Äôve got a lot of it recorded. It has a vision. It has a name, I think - for now. It‚Äôs just been fun experimenting. I‚Äôm always going to make pop music, but it has its own unique sound, which is exciting and something that feels like a movement from *Future Nostalgia*. It‚Äôs still in baby form, so we‚Äôll see as it progresses‚Äù (The Guardian, Jan 2022)

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs starting to feel good, it‚Äôs starting to take shape. I‚Äôm very excited about some of the new songs so it‚Äôs always exciting to look forward towards something.‚Äù (At Your Service: Elton John, March 2022)

‚ÄúI‚Äôve definitely grown up. Overall, whether it‚Äôs sonically or in terms of the themes, I‚Äôve matured. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm coming into my power and not afraid to talk about things. It‚Äôs about understanding what I want.‚Äù (Vogue, May 2022)

‚ÄúAs I'm writing my new album, I feel even more liberated in a completely different way,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúAnd even more in control than I thought.‚Äù (Vogue Australia, Sept 2022)

‚ÄúI‚Äôm very excited about it. It‚Äôs really starting to take shape, but I‚Äôm still be working on it. Maybe something will come out next year. I have to feel really good about it before I put anything out.‚Äù (BBC Newscast, Sept 2022)

‚ÄúWell when I was speaking to Elton I really felt like I was halfway done. But it‚Äôs taken a complete turn as I‚Äôve carried on working, and I really feel now that it‚Äôs starting to sound cohesive. The album is still pop but it‚Äôs different sonically, and there‚Äôs more of a lyrical theme.‚Äù (Variety, Nov 2022)

""It has a lyrical theme, more so than sonic. It‚Äôs still pop so I‚Äôm not getting away from that. I still want to dance and have fun, and do another crazy tour. It‚Äôs like a bit more mature in some ways. If I told you the title, everything would make sense ‚Äì but I think we‚Äôll just have to wait"" (ESNS23, January 2023)

‚ÄúThe only baby I‚Äôm thinking about is my new album.‚Äù (Vogue France, August, 2023)

‚ÄúI listen to Sting, who my dad used to love, and all those voices that I grew up with: The Police, Stereophonics, Primal Scream, Pulp, Sades‚Ä¶ And, of course, David Bowie, Prince, Elton John‚Ä¶ I also love *la chanson fran√ßaise*, Spanish music‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm very eclectic, actually.‚Äù (Vogue France, August 2023) 

‚ÄúThe next record will still be pop, she says, lest her ‚Äòfans have a meltdown.‚Äô She doesn‚Äôt want to ‚Äòalienate‚Äô them, although she‚Äôs developing a new sound that may be informed less by the house and disco beats beneath songs than by 1970s-era psychedelia. (‚Ä¶) The next album will \[also\] be ‚Äòmore personal‚Äô.‚Äù (NYTimes Style Magazine, August 2023)

‚ÄúI feel most creatively free in the studio. Writing and experimenting with new sounds always gives me a feeling of release.‚Äù (Evening Standard, September 2023)

*From Others* 

‚ÄúI mean, I‚Äôve heard some of it and it‚Äôs incredible. I think that‚Äôs why there‚Äôs the disco ball that smashes in the video, right? This feels like her triumphant stomp on that era of her music into whatever she does next.‚Äù (Mark Ronson, Vulture, July 2023)

‚ÄúKentish says Lipa is ‚Äúalready thinking‚Äù about her third album and is planning to pull off ‚Äúsomething completely different and at scale.‚Äù ‚ÄúShe was talking about album No.3 when we barely had No.2 done!,‚Äù he marvels. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre half-expecting that she might want to take a break or go about things differently but she‚Äôs like ‚ÄòRight, what‚Äôs next?‚Äô Her interests, her knowledge, her thirst to learn new things and to be in control of what she does just grows and grows. She‚Äôs taking time to fully realize the album conceptually, but her belief in herself and the belief that she can pull off something completely different and at scale has only grown.‚Äù‚Äù (Joe Kentish, Variety, May 2021)

*Unfounded Sources*

‚ÄúShe has already come up with great songs, but she won‚Äôt release DL3 until she is completely happy. She is putting the hours in to get some amazing music‚Äù (‚ÄòA source‚Äô, The Sun, Oct 2021)

‚ÄúDua‚Äôs third album is really personal to her and she has been hands on at every turn. She has spent hundreds of hours in the studio and has written on every song - that is really important to her. Dua has been very clear about her direction in keeping it upbeat and fun, but she will be a lot more revealing in her lyrics. The label are really excited about it and are planning a lengthy campaign on a whole new scale to maximize the music‚Ä¶‚Äù (The Sun, Feb 2023)

**Conclusion** 

So what can we expect? Thematically: This seems to be the part we have the most information on. I think we can expect something more mature, more personal, tied to searching for identity, perhaps even more political. Lyrically: She talks about lyrics as much if not more than the sonic vibe of the album, so I think we can expect an upped pen game, especially with collaborators like Tobias Jesso Jr. and Caroline Polachek. Vocally: In recent releases like Potion and Dance the Night, Dua seems playful with her vocals, going into a higher range, and she sounded really strong on her most recent tour, I think we can expect to hear her new things with her voice. Sonically: So far we only have the addition of Kevin Parker, Danny L Harle, and ""70s psychedelia"" to go off. Expect the unexpected. Visually: Little to no information but new rumors and interviews suggest a radical change of hairstyle to lean into the era. I also think the talks of 'doing something at scale' suggest a major effort for a cohesive era. As a last bit of my own unfounded speculation, she mentioned the word 'duality' A LOT in her Vogue France interview, and there's the obvious idiosyncrasy with her own name. I don't think an album called/themed Duality can be anything other than a double album. Beyonc√©'s third solo album was I Am...Sasha Fierce, could Dua replicate the success of a more personal, sonically divergent double album?? We can only wait and see.

"In a podcast with Rivers Coumo, NPR host coined a new term for a punk based ""white rap"". 
Lots of emo and indipop rock bands have used this style around the time Rivers published his songs Beverly Hills and I Was Scared. 
The a recent song most similar to Olivia's in my opinion is Chaise Longue by Wet Leg which may be inspiration for her. 
Her song is def alt/indi related so it's not like she's scribbling with a pen to create a random new song, it's a real genre.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OliviaRodrigo/comments/170tihx/bad_idea_right_is_indipop_whiterap_genre/,Bad Idea Right?

"So by now you have probably heard the theory that BE3 is coming out on 7 July 2023 because Wwafawdwg came out 2 years after dsam on 29 March maggies(billies mother)'s birthday and hte came out 2 years later on finneas' birthday (30 july) and July 30 2023 will be 2 years after hte on patrick(billies dad)'s birthday.There is also a possibility that it could come out on 
21 August 2023 because that is Jesse's birthday but they could have been working on BE3 before billie and jesse started dateing 


billies website changed its now black and white with a different font and for a few days she had a red pfp on insta and posed on her story ""I'm not being sneaky I just wanted to change the picture"" but a few days later it was slightly darker.this leads me to believe that the albums main colours will be white,red and black.

‚ö†Ô∏èTHIS PART IS MY SPECULATION/OPINION‚ö†Ô∏è
Personally I think that it will be like if billie now wrote Wwafawdwg and sadly I don't think that billie will be dyeing her hair again because she said she prefers black and it helps her blend in more but I think that we might see her with a red or white wig for a music video or even the album cover.tgere is also a high chance that a single for the new album will come out in the next few weeks.I also think that blohsh will make a comeback because we haven't seen it much on merch from hte and billie has started to wear it again (I keep wanting to call blohsh a him and idfk whyüò≠)i think blohsh also will suit BE3 more than it has hte.She will probably also delete most of the hte merch from the site.On the tour I think the setlists will be similar to the ones from the hte tour with the songs from BE3 included ofc(bad guy and hte at the end with confetti drops,the oxitocin/copycat transition ect) but I also think that because she played xanny,wywg,wiwo and ily recently she's going to bring some older/less popular songs back onto the setlists e.g coap,lbig and 8.Im not even 50% sure about this but I'm being hopeful that she will do meet and greets again but because she's gaining popularity and will continue to because of BE3 she might not but then again its billie sges unpredictable and loves us so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I think she's  going to go back to being more like ""old billie""(not in a mental heath way) with BE3 ill make another post when I get more evidence/info <3 also sorry if this has been really wordy I'm not very good at big blocks of text üòÖ

For example Hyeins storybook features mostly fairtales right, and yet at the end of the book contents list after she opens it there is not actually a  fairytale at the end of at that list it's actually the title of a book from like a hundred years ago called the revenant about a man killed  while hunting by a bear.

"Collaborations have been in music since the dawn of time. People feature on each other's songs, or they enlist popular producers to write for them or make beats for them.

After Le Sserafim got the legendary guitarist Nile Rodgers, who's been in the industry 50+ years (his more popular Collab was he played the guitar with Pharrell and Daft Punk's ""I'm Up All Night To Get Lucky) which was a HUGE hit a couple years ago. 

It got me thinking, who is your DREAM collaboration or Feature on a NewJeans song? 

Any Artists or Producers come in mind that would just BLOW UP your mind if they collaborated with NewJeans? 

What sounds or songs can you imagine? 
And this discussion is open to KPop AND Western artists too, both! So is there any KPop soloists or groups you think would be a great feature for NewJeans? Any American Artists? 

Here's some examples I saw on the internet:

Fifty Fifty & NewJeans (BILLBOARD HIT MAKER 100%)
BAD Bunny (? Lol bunny concept fits I guess? It would make sense for the Spanish speaking fans too)
Justin Beiber (HYBE America's CEO is Justin Beiber's manager, so the relationship is there)
CHARLIE PUTH (this one makes sense, charlie loves newjeans)

"Hi everyone! Going to see Adele on Saturday 2/25, sitting in section 204. I was wondering when Adele is walking around during her performance what sections is she in? It looks like it‚Äôs between the 100s and 200s but I wasn‚Äôt too sure. Wondering if anyone who‚Äôs been already can give some insight here? 
Also, will we be able to get confetti if seated in the 200s?
I saw a post about the shop being open on Fridays and Saturdays only from 12-8pm. What is in the store besides programs and I assume t-shirts? Trying to figure out how much money I‚Äôll be needing lol

"I believe the original intent of the MV, as with all of NewJeans MV's is the concept of growing up as a girl.  But in Ditto it's mostly done symbolically, metaphorically.

Of course theres some other dimensions to it, references to other Korean film and even the fandom in general, but the main thrust I believe is experiences as a girl while growing up.

NewJeans in the Ditto MV are symbolic representatives of childhood, carefree, innocent, with energy.  Heeseo, who is filming them, is part of that group, the song is pumping, then she notices a boy looking at her.  She looks away, she never noticed that boy before.  The music becomes tense, has something changed in her?

The music stops, the scene changes.  Shes idly drinking at the fountain, and the boy approaches.  The song begins, as if to signify something washing over her.

As both music videos progress, you see Heeseo begin pulling away from NewJeans, sometimes agitated.  Focusing herself more on the boy.  And watching NewJeans at a distance, as if they are fading into the background. The vanishing NewJeans and destroyed camera perhaps signifying a fear of change, or that shes destroying a part of herself.

At the end of both MV's she watches afar at a Fawn, the symbol of innocence, and in MV2, the fawn walks out of view, followed by a shot of Heeseo with the boy, symbolizing the end of her childhood and the start of her teens.

Years later she is watching her old videos, and gives a smile, and NewJeans walks in and is there with her again.  She realizes she didn't destroy a part of herself as she feared, her childhood is still within her, in her memories, able to be experienced again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/NewJeans/comments/100adhs/the_ditto_mvs_are_metaphorical_not_literal/,"The Ditto MV's are Metaphorical, not Literal.",NewJeans,t3_100adhs,/r/NewJeans/comments/100adhs/the_ditto_mvs_are_metaphorical_not_literal/,2023-01-01 03:00:40,New Jeans

Paid a visit to HYBE headquarters, home of many successful K-pop labels and groups. What I found inspiring is the amount of time and focus they put into building an empire that constantly reinvents pop music and culture, a vision I can truly relate with!

"Hey guys!

I think there's no place better than here to ask for some help, as me and my girlfriend are currently contemplating going to tomorrow's gig at Sziget Festival. She likes Billie a lot, but obviously the daily ticket price is hefty so she's a bit hesitant (and our original plan was to not go on the final day, cuz by then people are already exhausted af). As far as I'm concerned, I only know a couple of her songs (which I like!), and don't rly know what her other stuff is like when played live, or generally how well she performs live. I've done my fair bit of research in the past 60mins, but I was wondering if someone could paint an objective picture as to what to expect during a live show? Would Billie's sets be something that a complete stranger to her music enjoy, or is it more tailored to people really familiar with her music?

Hey everyone!
So my little sister recently became a big fan of Taylor. She's 13 and she started listening a lot to Taylor recently and it's really cute. I wanted to give her something for Christmas maybe Taylor related, but the thing is I'm not really √† huge swiftie and I don't really know what I should give her. I thought about giving her merch or something. The problem is it's √† bit expensive and I don't have a lot of money since I'm barely 16 and I don't work, so I'll have to use my pocket money that I saved. I was thinking of maybe using 30‚Ç¨ (i'm french so we use euros)

"Posted every Monday for the following weekend. Use this post to find fellow Daydreamers to meet up with in Las Vegas! 

At the risk of sounding like an overbearing parent, your mods ask that you PLEASE use your own discretion when scheduling a meetup. Vegas is a very busy city with lots of wild characters. Tips to stay safe:

1. Meet in a public place.
2. Do not give out your hotel or room number.
3. Be cautious of who you add on some social media. Some social media (like Snapchat's Snapmap) can share your location to friends.
4. Always keep your drink(s) in your line-of-sight and don't take drinks (or anything else-- it's Vegas after all) from someone you just met, unless you see them get it from the bar.

# Understanding the FENTY Ecosystem (the basics)üë©‚Äçüè´

Fenty is an ecosystem that consists of [Fenty Fashion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenty_(fashion_house)), [Fenty Beauty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenty_Beauty) and [Fenty x Savage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savage_X_Fenty).

These are three separate companies. Different funding, different shareholders. Different businesses entirely.

Fenty Fashion launched in 2019. That was a flop. A really cool fashion channel called [Understitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcLGDfUtYCI) made a whole video about it. I highly recommend watching that to get the 411 on why the brand ultimately failed.

Fenty Beauty and Savage x Fenty on the other hand have been resounding smash hits.

*Why?*

From what I understand *(would love your hot take‚Äôs on this!)*, it seems to have boiled down to; the right kind of products, backed by the right kind of people, with the right kind of distribution, marketed/positioned in the right way and launched at the perfect time.

So in retrospect, we can understand that Rihanna‚Äôs promotion of [Fenty Beauty & Fenty x Savage at the superbowl ](https://www.forbes.com.au/news/billionaires/super-bowl-halftime-show-rihanna-earns-5-6-million-from-makeup-touchup/)was a kind of Victory Lap moment for two break-out brands that since their respective launches in 2017 & 2018 have been blowing up the internet‚Ä¶ and Rihanna's wallet.

Fenty Beauty was such a success that it‚Äôs quite literally what made Rihanna a Billionaire based on the [1.4 Billion dollar value](https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-58084543) of the 50% stake she owns in the company. [Fenty Beauty makes more money than Kylie Cosmetics, KKW Beauty & Jessica Alba‚Äôs Honest company](https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-58084543). Savage x Fenty on the other hand will likely double Rihanna‚Äôs wealth based on the 30% stake she owns of that company, if the [3 billion dollar IPO](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-11/rihanna-s-lingerie-company-said-to-weigh-ipo-at-3-billion-value#xj4y7vzkg)\` the company is shooting for goes through.

This deep-dive will focus specifically on[ Fenty x Savage](https://www.savagex.com/featured/aboutus) but given who owns what, you may find it relevant to Fenty Beauty as well.

# The Disruption FugaziüçùüáÆüáπ

My beef jerky with Savage x Fenty begins with the [concept of disruption](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/8-tips-overcoming-disruption-hederik-laloo/).

&#x200B;

>[**Disruption**](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/new-market-disruption#:~:text=Disruption%20is%20the%20process%20by,new%20entrant%20for%20market%20share.) is defined as; *‚Äúa company or form of technology that causes radical change in an existing industry or market by means of innovation.‚Äù*  
>  
>But I prefer this explanation; [*‚Äúa company is disruptive*](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/8-tips-overcoming-disruption-hederik-laloo/) *if it has found an innovative way of doing business in an existing sector or is creating a new market and in the process, is shaking up the status quo.*  
>  
>*Many organizations have been described as disruptive, but the label is only really justified when the company permanently disrupts the existing sector, forcing established businesses to change their approach.‚Äù*

The words I want you to keep in mind here are üòà‚ùó**radical change** & **shaking up the status quo‚ùóüòà**

Since Fenty x Savage‚Äôs launch in 2018, the narrative that‚Äôs been building itself around the brand is that it‚Äôs a [disruptor](https://www.marketingweek.com/100-disruptive-brands/) that is literally [changing the game](https://fabrikbrands.com/25-disruptive-brands/). This is a narrative that has not only been pushed by Fenty x Savage. It‚Äôs also a narrative that has been amplified by media, blogs, and influencers on their payroll.

In 2022, they even received the[ Femmy Brand Disruptor award](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/savage-x-fenty-parade-among-191507300.html)**.** I have been curious about this narrative since the beginning. I think anyone with any experience in relevant industries (mine is media!- what‚Äôs yours?) will tell you that the amount of money, power, connections and labor it takes to manufacture the kind of buzz Savage x Fenty did and does is quite simply not possible for most brands that are truly, **‚Äúdisrupting the world. ‚Äú** So the question I started my research for this deep-dive with was;

**Who and what are really powering Fenty x Savage ?**

# Blood Money ü©∏

Fenty x Savage was launched in 2018 as a partnership between Rihanna and a company called [Techstyle Group.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TechStyle_Fashion_Group) Techstyle Group is a LA based incubator with many brands under it.[ Some of those brands include Kate Hudson‚Äôs Fab Athletics, Shoe Dazzle, Just Fab and Fenty x Savage.](https://www.techstylefashiongroup.com/)

Techstyle Group‚Äôs whole shtick revolves around this online-based membership model where customers are charged monthly for credit towards their purchases. Yes, this is the same membership model that landed Fenty x Savage in hot water for [alleged consumer fraud-](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/11/business/rihannas-savage-x-fenty-deceptive-marketing.html) we‚Äôll get to that.

I wasn‚Äôt able to find information on what stake Techstyle Group has in Fenty x Savage but we do know that Rihanna‚Äôs stake in Fenty x Savage is reportedly 30%. However what we also know is that [Fenty x Savage has gone through five rounds of funding](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/savage-x-fenty/company_financials). They‚Äôve raised a total of [310 million dollars](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/savage-x-fenty/company_financials). So the distribution of who owns what and how much of it may have changed and will continue to.

***Bottom line***\*: if you want to know where your consumer dollar is going you gotta look at the shareholders and that‚Äôs where things get kind of funky.ü¶®üí®\*

When we look at [series A funding](https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/savage-x-fenty-series-a--bc77580a) we can see that Savage x Fenty got money from [ACME Capital](https://www.acme.vc/), J[ay Z‚Äôs Marcy Venture Growth](https://www.marcyvp.com/about) and [Avenir Growth Capital](https://www.avenirgrowth.com/). Nothing really to see here. Other than the fact that [ACME Capital](https://www.acme.vc/) has a stake in pretty major companies like Uber, SpaceX, AirBnb, RobinHood. The only real fashion player they have is Poshmark but vintage is a completely different beast. So by looking at Series A alone you could still kind of buy-into this disruption narrative. You can buy into it until you get to [series B](https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/savage-x-fenty-series-b--f7f10557)‚Ä¶.and[ series C. ](https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/savage-x-fenty-series-c--02857f95)

In February 2021, Fenty x Savage secured 115 million dollars in [series B funding](https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/savage-x-fenty-series-b--f7f10557). A company called L Catterton was listed as being one of the investors.

**Well who is L Catterton?**

[L Catterton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L_Catterton) was previously called Catterton Partners. In 2016 they rebranded to [L Catterton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L_Catterton) following a merger. A merger is when different companies join forces and become one entity so everybody can make more money. So this new gang consists of Catterton, [LVMH ](https://seekingalpha.com/article/2525615-map-of-brands-in-luxury-fashion-lvmh)and Financiere Agace which is the family holding company of [Bernard Arnaud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Arnault).

So then I asked myself - Who is the f\*ck is  [Bernard Arnaud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Arnault)?

Ah yes, the world‚Äôs literal richest man. [Bernard Arnaud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Arnault) is also the founder, chairman and CEO of[ LVMH,](https://seekingalpha.com/article/2525615-map-of-brands-in-luxury-fashion-lvmh) Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy. One of the companies involved in the merger.

Who is [LVMH](https://seekingalpha.com/article/2525615-map-of-brands-in-luxury-fashion-lvmh)? What is [LVMH](https://seekingalpha.com/article/2525615-map-of-brands-in-luxury-fashion-lvmh)?

Literally the company that already owns **ALL** of the luxury fashion brands. There‚Äôs a Youtube Video called *‚Äú*[*Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy Owns Everything In Your Close*t.‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKVQ4FX5tw8) Louis Vuitton, Loewe, Fendi, Celine, Dior, Givenchy, Kenzo, Marc Jacobs, Emilion Pucci.

So, t[he richest man in the world](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/worlds-richest-billionaires-over-the-past-10-years/) is getting even richer thanks to Fenty x Savage, he owns \*almost\* the entire luxury fashion industry and now he has his fingers even deeper in intimates. The funniest thing is, I was able to find market insight information that dates back to 2018 that had already listed LVHM as [a major dominant player in the lingerie market](https://www.openpr.com/news/1408350/lingerie-market-industry-growth-2018-2026-by-major-players-lvmh-mo-t-hennessy-louis-vuitton-se-l-brands-inc-hanesbrands-inc-jockey-international-inc-nike-inc-phillips-van-heusen-corporation-groupe-chantelle-mas-holdings-limited-ggi-holdings.html) before they even had a stake in Savage x Fenty.

**Congratulations but disruption where?**

Buckle up, it gets worse..

When I took a gander at Fenty x Savage‚Äôs[ series C investors](https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/savage-x-fenty-series-c--02857f95) I noticed this flashy name. The [Abu Dhabi Growth Fund](https://www.adg.ae/)**.** I wondered, who could that possibly be?

The[ Abu Dhabi Growth Fund](https://www.adg.ae/) is a global investment fund owned by the Government of [Abu Dhabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Abu_Dhabi). The Government of Abu Dhabi is a subnational authority that governs the Emirate of Abu Dhabi and it‚Äôs one of the seven monarchies that make up the United Arab Emirates. The guy who runs the Government of Abu Dhabi is this guy, a monarch called[ Sheik Mohammed Bin Zayed Al Nahnyan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_bin_Zayed_Al_Nahyan).

**A Sheik? Who is this man?**

Other than the man who will likely get at least \*some\* percentage of every dollar you spend on Fenty x Savage, he also happens to be the leader of [an authoritarian regime](https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/UNITED-ARAB-EMIRATES-2019-HUMAN-RIGHTS-REPORT.pdf). In this man‚Äôs authoritarian regime political and civil rights are limited, free speech is restricted and there is no free and independent media.

More relevant to Savage x Fenty, If you watch my [Beyonce Short](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/f6pZtYKAYKo), where I explain why her performance in Dubai was so controversial, you‚Äôll also discover that the[ UAE ](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2022/country-chapters/united-arab-emirates)is a regime that in order to maintain its grip on power, according to [Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2022/country-chapters/united-arab-emirates), practices things like torture, arbitrary detention and the forced dissappearance and some argue straight up murder of citizens, dissidents and residents. In the UAE homosexuality is a crime punishable by death and women still live under a male guardianship system.

# TechStyle Groupe & alleged Consumer Fraud

Many of you know about this tea, but I promise I'm about to make it taste even sweeter. üç≠

As I mentioned earlier, Fenty x Savage at its inception was primarily a partnership between Rihanna and the company TechStyle Group. What you need to know is that the online subscription-based business model behind Fenty x Savage is powered by Techstyle Group.

If you‚Äôre one to follow the gossip, you likely heard [people ](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/lckykn/savage_x_fenty_review_not_worth_it/)online calling Fenty x Savage‚Äôs subscription service [a scam](https://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/qqp9mn/do_not_buy_from_savage_x_fenty/).

Well, according to the government of California, rumor, it is no more.

Here‚Äôs a recap of what happened. In 2020, the Consumer WatchDog Group called [Truth In Advertising](https://truthinadvertising.org/brands/techstyle-fashion-group/) filed a [formal complaint to the FTC](https://truthinadvertising.org/brands/savage-x-fenty/) against Fenty x Savage and Techstyle. This kickstarted what would lead to a lawsuit filed against the company in August 2022.

In August 2022, Santa Clara County and four other California Local Governments alleged that Savage x Fenty defrauded customers by automatically enrolling them in the brands VIP plan & making it really hard to get out of it. They were also [accused of falsely advertising](https://remake.world/stories/rihanna-savage-x-fenty-scores-worse-than-shein-in-accountability/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rihanna-savage-x-fenty-scores-worse-than-shein-in-accountability) the ability to use store credit and misled consumers over product pricing.

In December 2022, [Fenty x Savage was fined 1.2 million dollars](https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/savage-x-fenty-rihanna-lingerie-company-settles-california-consumer-protection-lawsuit/) in order to settle the lawsuit. They have to [pay 1 million dollars in civil penalties, along with 50 000 in investigative costs. ](https://www.thefashionlaw.com/rihannas-savage-x-fenty-to-pay-1-2-million-to-settle-consumer-protection-lawsuit/)They also have to pay restitution totalling 150 000 to California VIP customers who tried to cancel their membership and did not get refunds.

The funny thing is, this isn‚Äôt the first time Riri‚Äôs business partners Techstyle Group have been in hot water for this very thing. In 2014 [Techstyle Group reached a legally-binding settlement of 1.8 million dollars](https://truthinadvertising.org/brands/techstyle-fashion-group/) after being sued by the state of California for allegedly misleading customers about automatic monthly payments charged to their credit cards in connection with justfab.com, fabkids.com, shoedazzle.com, and fab athletics. As part of the settlement Techstyle agreed to refrain from;

>**‚Äú*****Making untrue or misleading statements about products or services; deceptively marketing product prices and discounts that are only available to consumers who are bound by the company‚Äôs VIP membership without clearly and conspicuously disclosing this fact; and failing to provide a timely cancellation mechanism*****.‚Äù**

According to Truth in Advertising, fast-forward 5 years and techstyle was still using the same tactics it did in 2014 with Fenty x Savage in 2020.

The real kicker though is that Techstyle group was co-founded by these two guys, [Don Ressler ](https://www.techstylefashiongroup.com/don-ressler) &  [Adam Goldenberg](https://www.techstylefashiongroup.com/adam-goldenberg). Effectively Riri‚Äôs business partners in Fenty x Savage.

According to this absolutely crazy Buzzfeed News expose I found called [The Dark, Scammy History of JustFab and Fabletics](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/sapna/justfab-the-billion-dollar-startup-with-a-dark-past), at least 6 of the brands/businesses associated with Don Ressler and Adam Goldenberg have been; *‚Äúconning consumers into subscriptions for anti-aging shampoo and wrinkle cream under the guise of ‚Äúbrand-building‚Äù and ‚Äúinnovation.‚Äù‚Äù* since at least 2004.

**So I just had to ask, what are some of the products these two visionaries used to sell?**

üíØOnly the best kindüíØ

We have:

* Dream Shape diet pills, meant for consumption before bedtime and that would, ‚ÄúBurn Fat While You Sleep.‚Äù
* [HYDRODERM BODY SHAPE CELLULITE TONING LOTION](http://www.hydroderm.com/dsp_pBodyshape.php). Which was a ‚Äúsecret weapon‚Äù to help tone and firm the areas that exercise alone can‚Äôt shape.
* [Kronos hair products](https://www.facebook.com/KroneProfessional/videos/704793684143230/) that were sold as BOTOX for your hair.
* [Raw Minerals](https://www.rawbeautyminerals.com/), a knockoff of better-known makeup line BareMinerals. #TheAudacity lmao
* [Hydroderm Antiwrinkle](https://www.hydroderm.info/) creams promising results ‚Äúbetter than botox.‚Äù

But the real masterpiece was a company called Sensa. According to [Buzzfeed News,](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/sapna/justfab-the-billion-dollar-startup-with-a-dark-past) Sensa is better known as one of the [largest](http://www.buzzfeed.com/sapna/9-crazy-weight-loss-scams-americans-fell-for-this-year) weight-loss scams ever targeted by the FTC and as the bureau‚Äôs [second-biggest](http://www.nbcnews.com/health/diet-fitness/miracle-weight-loss-nope-feds-say-34-million-suit-n5351) deceptive advertisement settlement ever. In 2014 the same year as the other lawsuit, [Sensa was fined 50 million dollars for deceptive advertising](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2014/01/sensa-three-other-marketers-fad-weight-loss-products-settle-ftc-charges-crackdown-deceptive).

# WTF Johnny Depp

In November 2022, Fenty x Savage aired the fourth volume of its much-hyped runway show. [Johnny Depp made an appearance](https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2022/11/rihanna-johnny-depp-savage-x-fenty-show) and the internet lost its mind. It was super controversial. Yes Johnny [**won his defamation suit**](https://maifeminism.com/the-avalanche-of-misogynistic-hate-speech-directed-at-amber-heard-must-unite-women-against-resistance-to-our-voices/) against Heard but Johnny [**did not** ](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/johnny-depp-not-defamed-by-wife-beater-story-u-k-judge-rules-4085421/)come out of the trials [**unscathed reputation wise**.](https://www.reuters.com/article/britain-people-depp-idINKBN27H1UB) And so, I honestly still can‚Äôt crack the code of why Savage x Fenty thought this move would be a good idea‚Ä¶Part of me thinks it was just a PR/shock value stunt but another part of me, given the [political polarization of the trial,](https://www.vox.com/culture/23131538/johnny-depp-amber-heard-tiktok-snl-extremism) thinks that it may be part of a larger strategy to test the waters‚Ä¶or appeal to in a wink-wink-nudge-nudge way to a more ‚Äúconservative‚Äù consumer base. [‚ÄúThe inclusive consumer‚Äù ](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/the-rise-of-the-inclusive-consumer)is here to stay, but so is [progressive backlash](https://translegislation.com/), maybe they want to capitalize on both these social movements.

After all, If you can go from selling [alleged scammy weight loss products](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2014/01/sensa-three-other-marketers-fad-weight-loss-products-settle-ftc-charges-crackdown-deceptive) to selling [big is beautiful.](https://yitty.fabletics.com/)(Techstyle Group/Fabletics are also partners in Lizzo‚Äôs x Yitty!

"I know the following individual fashion collabs have been announced:
Minji - Chanel (& Chanel Beauty)
Hanni - Gucci (& Armani Beauty)
Danielle - Burberry (& YSL Beauty)
Hyein - Louis Vuitton
Haerin - not announced but Dior speculated 

Pretend these haven‚Äôt been announced yet, what would you choose for each member instead?

For me:

Minji - Prada because it‚Äôs just as sophisticated as Chanel but more edgy. Chanel has gotten too classic and boring with the tweed sets. Minji is classically beautiful but she‚Äôs also a little androgynous and cool which would go great with Prada 

Danielle - Dior because to me she is so sweet and has the most princessy feminine vibe and would look absolutely gorgeous in Dior‚Äôs big gowns like Jisoo 

Haerin - She screams Givenchy to me because she‚Äôs very intriguing and stunning in an atypical way. Givenchy‚Äôs moody romantic style has that elusive sort of vibe just like her

Hanni - I think she is absolutely perfect for Gucci. Gucci is dominating with most of its models/celebrity reps being really creative, unique, and talented people like Hanni and the clothes suit her as an artist 

Hyein - I like Louis Vuitton for her but think she would also look absolutely fire in Moschino, Fendi, or Versace. She has so much confidence for being the youngest and looks the most like a model so she could really rock the bold looks those brands are known for 

These are just my opinions :) What would you choose??",https://www.reddit.com/r/NewJeans/comments/128sjx1/if_you_could_assign_their_fashion_brands_what/,If you could assign their fashion brands what would you pick for each member?,NewJeans,t3_128sjx1,/r/NewJeans/comments/128sjx1/if_you_could_assign_their_fashion_brands_what/,2023-04-01 17:17:57,New Jeans

"I was listening to Taylor's albums back to back and I really didn't like the vocal performance on Red (Original), as it just felt weak. In Speak Now, her vocals actually felt fuller and better, more emotional (even though all too well exists). Fearless doesn't have particularly strong vocals.

The lyrics too, are great. She seemed to stop writing lyrics/melodies before of the production for the next few albums and that's why I think they are weaker, except some standouts from red. (All too well, I almost do, etc.) Her albums got worse lyrically.

These downward trends ended with Lover, I really loved lover and I think it's the first album that compared to SN, of course most disagree. Evermore and Red TV are also great; but for nine years Speak Now was unmatched

What's your opinion, and do you think red has a weaker vocal performance?",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/11wvwyc/speak_now_is_a_standout_among_earlier_albums/,Speak Now is a standout among earlier albums,TaylorSwift,t3_11wvwyc,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/11wvwyc/speak_now_is_a_standout_among_earlier_albums/,2023-03-20 21:06:32,Taylor Swift

"Let me preface this by saying NewJeans is the first K-Pop group I've really liked. I've been aware of K-pop since the 2010s with BigBang, EXO and BTS but none captured me like NewJeans where I can say I'm a legit fan. So I'm not sure how stuff like this typically works in the K-pop scene/culture but Super Shy is ***begging*** for a PinkPantheress remix. 

NewJeans' heavily UK garage/DnB influenced bubblegum pop is PinkPantheress' exact soundscape. The airy vocals, the forlorn lyrics and the whimsical production is pretty much exactly PinkPantheress' style and I think she would be a great addition.

PP would bring an element of star power and crossover potential that is hard to grip in this sound's space. We've seen that PP can be a hitmaker on her own with [Boys a Liar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_hj-wT3biU), [Passion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Szr5Dcwn4Y) etc. and an excellent collaborator with [Boy's a Liar pt.2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oftolPu9qp4). Not to mention that it would be an internet darling for both artists as it seems that NewJeans' definitely feels like more of an internet-y type of group via their aesthetic and the penchant for trending dances and PP was born from TikTok. Both acts also like to have some of their songs run short. 

Both are clearly on an album/ep cycle too as they've been dropping singles all year to great success. And, the monthly listeners are comparable: 26 mill per month for PinkPantheress and 18 mill per month for NewJeans (but they have the machine behind them). Also PinkPantheress has already tapped into the [Powerpuff Girls theme](https://www.youtube.com/@ponies721), years before NewJeans. 

In North America/UK remixes typically are pretty organic, PinkPantheress did Boys a Liar pt.2 after DMing back and forth with Ice Spice to be on the track. Hip hop collabs are usually because of an interpersonal relationships too, Dave and Central Cee made [Sprinter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSY3i5XHHXo&pp=ygUUc3ByaW50ZXIgY2VudHJhbCBjZWU%3D) and [a whole EP together](https://open.spotify.com/album/0On7uutIu9rZRvP9aJbMog?si=55657f8356754d36) because they're friends who turned 25 this year. I have no idea how it works with K-Pop when it comes to remixes but I just see a ton of parallels and potential for collaboration between the two. It would only be beneficial for both acts to link up on Super Shy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/NewJeans/comments/151dowt/super_shy_needs_a_pinkpantheress_remix/,Super Shy needs a PinkPantheress remix,NewJeans,t3_151dowt,/r/NewJeans/comments/151dowt/super_shy_needs_a_pinkpantheress_remix/,2023-07-16 18:32:54,New Jeans

There are singers in this modern r&b genre, or even pop that suits me personally like SZA, The Weeknd, Frank Ocean, or even Janelle Monae. But, I don't like Ariana's music at all.

"The first five pics show the parallel between Nemoralia and the Eras Tour during Willow. 

Nemoralia is also known as Hecatean Ides, a festival commemorating Diana on August 13-15. Observers would travel by boats across Lake Nemi to participate. It celebrated the triple nature of the goddess Diana, goddess of animals and the hunt. ‚ÄúLighting candles and torches, wearing garlands and wreaths, making prayers and offerings to Diana by tying prayer ribbons and leaving tokens near bodies of water and other sacred places‚Äù were all ways observers could participate. 

Next three pics are the visual during Tis the Damn Season. Two girls play hide and seek on the screen, and look at the trees. Cypress, and Dianna had them in her backyard.

I'm just worried cuz I want her to be healthy. 

Am I tripping? Or shes healthy im not a dietician or anything. Whenever I tell my friends shes my bias cuz I like her voice out of all the 5 they always say she's too thin and yeah I can't really counter that since its true.

Night 3: The It Girl - 1989

Night 4: The Moods - Rep/Lover/Midnights

Night 5: The Long Pond Live - Folklore/Evermore

"This is me trying to divert from the fact that we're all shocked taylor is at travis' game, lol.

I love Enchanted. Easily one of my top 5 songs ever, it even inspired me to pick up guitar when I was 12. For so long, I wished there was a MV. When Speak Now TV came out, I (and a lot of us) hoped she'd finally do it. I'll admit, I was heartbroken it didn't happen.

But the more I think about it, the more I think taylor made the right choice. When Enchanted first came out, a lot of us intertwined it with speak now the song - specifically the New Girl wedding scene where taylor made an appear.

We all had our own vision of how the music video should be. Dreamy. Ethereal. Friends to lovers trope. Purple lol. Even with our unified vision, each swiftie had their own customizations - per se lol.

I think if taylor did put out a MV, it would disappoint those high expectations we had. Not to say taylor isn't capable of meeting our expectations - she is and often throws the ball out of the park. But, I think enchanted became such a personal song to the fandom. It became a personal song to every single swiftie. And this was propelled with the titkok trend using the enchanted song. If it were a MV, I wonder how much of our imagination and high hopes would be satisfied.

Some things are better left in imagination - that way the vision is perfected and pure - free from outside influence. That way, the song continues to holds a meaning to people that is so deeply unique.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/16r9455/unpopular_opinion_enchanted_shouldnt_be_a_music/,Unpopular opinion?

To a house, not a home, all alone cos nobody‚Äôs there

Never wanted love just a fancy car

Telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear

We could be the way forward and I know I‚Äôll pay for it

Forever is the sweetest con

I could never give you peace

I can be a phantom, holding him for ransom 

I keep him forever like a vendetta

He can be my jailer

"Hi Everyone!

Lately there have been a number of posts asking for seat views from various parts of the Colosseum. I think it'd be more helpful to have those photos living in one post versus scattered throughout the feed. 

If you've had the pleasure of attending Adele's show in Vegas, please consider adding a photo and include your section/row/seat number. If you can't remember your seat number, but saved your ticket to Apple Wallet, you can recall expired passes and get full ticket details. Please also consider adding your photo to [A View From My Seat](https://aviewfrommyseat.com/venue/The+Colosseum+At+Caesars+Palace/) so those who aren't a part of this wonderful subreddit can see your view as well.

**TL;DR** Post a photo from your view at The Colosseum. Include section/row and seat number (if possible).

"I just finished reading the memoir Educated by Tara Westover. The opening line of exile ‚ÄúI can see you standing, honey

Laughin', but the joke's not funny at all‚Äù sounds very similar to a repeating incident Tara recalls of her abusive older brother where she pretends to brush over abuse with laughter, pretending they were just playing. 

Also there is a line in the book when her other brother begins justifying actions of their family and she writes ‚Äúwas a film I had already seen, and knew the ending of‚Äù. 

The term exile has also been used in the book. Maybe it‚Äôs a stretch, but as I was reading the last few chapters of the book the words of the song came to mind. I always thought it was about romantic love but now I‚Äôm thinking maybe she wrote the song inspired by the book.

"Usually, I check out a group's music + voice + performance + aesthetics if they fit with me. But New Jeans hits different. I like their songs even though it doesn't fit my music taste. Their voices are SO good and got good choreography. But these are my secondary reasons.y primary reasons for finally getting to stan New Jeans is the bunny logo and that the fandom name is bunnies. Oh, and their YouTube shorts are so fun to watch. OH, and some of their promotions give me nostalgic vibes.

I heckin love rabbits, that's how I finally got to stan them. I wasn't into stanning them because I prefer a mature group (NJ are all not adults yet), but I just like to see myself as an older sister. I mean, they're just so cute and pretty I can't help but admire them.

"I had the idea to compile all of NewJeans‚Äô songs into a mini-CD to give to a friend of mine, who is a NewJeans fan (and was also the one who introduced me to them).

Mini-CDs are, as the name implies, smaller CDs (about 8cm in diameter) that can hold about 23 minutes of music, and can be played in any CD player with a tray, which she has. As NewJeans‚Äô catalog up until that point was below this, I thought it was perfect! 

So to make it extra special, I tried to make a mini ‚Äúbooklet‚Äù to go along with it (I wanted to make an actual booklet with multiple pages but it didn‚Äôt work out - or fit the case) and printed faux ‚Äúphotocards‚Äù as well! 

The tracklist was OMG and Ditto, followed by the NewJeans EP, and then Zero. I assembled an interlude, which I called ‚ÄúNWJNS FM‚Äù, to transition between Hurt and Zero since I had about a minute leftover, and I wanted to incorporate a little extra something in the audio front. I used sound effects I found online to emulate a radio, and MINDA‚Äôs top notch remixes of Hurt and Cookie, as if they were in radio stations, and topped it off with a Coca Cola being opened. If you want to check it out: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tTzQqcSRDb7yXxFVUeQUOEFtPOMyUMIM/view?usp=drivesdk

The images present in the ‚Äúbooklet‚Äù and ‚Äúphotocards‚Äù were not made by me, I just picked and assembled everything on that department - and doodled the tracklist.

Both me and my friend own legal copies of all of their music, which was what I used to make the CD.

They disrespect the artist. They spit on their legacy. They do not follow the artist‚Äô wishes.

We cannot let the Grammys do this to Adele!

I believe we should begin with a grassroots campaign, by crafting a hashtag, #CancelGrammys.

Second, we should write many many tweets at industry contacts protesting the awards.

Third, we should picket outside of the Recording Academy.

"# Did you know that flowers have their own secret coded language?

Floriography, or ‚Äúthe language of flowers‚Äù has been around for thousands of years, but it was especially popular during the Victorian era. (rules around etiquette were very strict during this time.) Flowers were used to send coded messages without appearing rude, immodest or causing a *(gasp!)* scandal.

One of the most popular floriography references of the Victorian era was *Le Langage des Fleurs* (1819).

Here are the ***secret coded messages*** behind some of the flowers Taylor has used, according to the English translation of *Le Langage des Fleurs*:

**Forget-Me-Nots:** This one is not really a secret code because it‚Äôs...***‚ÄúForget me not‚Äù.***

**Iris:** ***‚ÄúI have a message for you.‚Äù*** (Typically only used for good news.)

**Daisy:** ***‚ÄúYour secret‚Äôs safe with me.‚Äù/ ‚ÄùI‚Äôll never tell.‚Äù***

**Ivy:** ***‚ÄúI cling to thee.‚Äù*** (Wisteria was used for the same message.)

**Daphne:** ***‚ÄúI would not have you otherwise‚Äù.***

**Single Red Rose:** ***‚ÄúYou are the one.‚Äù/‚ÄùAll my deepest affections are concentrated in you.‚Äù***

**Carnations** were one of the most popular coded flowers of the Victorian era! *(I picture the carnations mentioned in ""Maroon"" as dark red, but she doesn't actually say, so I included a couple different colors.)*

**Dark Red Carnation:** ***‚ÄúAlas, my poor heart!‚Äù/‚ÄùMy heart aches for you!‚Äù***

**Pink Carnation:** ***‚ÄúI will never forget you.‚Äù***

**Striped Carnation:** ***‚ÄúI refuse you.‚Äù***

**Yellow Carnation:** ***‚ÄúMy heart is disappointed/dejected.‚Äù***

# Additional symbolism for flowers Taylor has referenced:

It‚Äôs possible that [Taylor](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/03/taylor-swift-watercolor-paintings) has been using floriography since the beginning of her career. However, it would take forever to go back that far, so I started from Reputation because it was released on *‚ÄúNational Forget-Me-Not Day‚Äù.*

**Reputation Magazine Poem Flowers:**

*(Since these are pressings, it is very possible that I haven‚Äôt identified them correctly. Please let me know if you think they may be something else!)*

**Volume 1:** **‚ÄúWhy She Disappeared‚Äù:**

https://preview.redd.it/cxbcabgxt9da1.png?width=739&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d8b5bc78278281a164131d9ec381ba6a844ab18e

**Yellow Foxglove:** Contradictory, insincerity (Foxglove is both a poison and a medicine, so they can both heal and hurt.)

**Campanula** (Bell Flowers): Everlasting love, constancy.

**Nasturtium** (also on Feb. page in Rep Calendar) : Victory in struggle/conquest. The Latin translation means ‚Äútrophy of war‚Äù.

**Volume 2: ‚ÄúIf You‚Äôre Anything Like Me‚Äù**

https://preview.redd.it/dinysa50u9da1.png?width=617&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f16299d9abb1b46b5090138a99f7f7476e5662a3

**Campanula (Bell Flowers):** Everlasting love, constancy

**Summer Lilac/Butterfly Bush (Buddleia):** Rebirth, resurrection, new beginning

# Lover Era:

**Roses:** There are so many different meanings for roses depending on the number and variety! Red: Passion, desire, romance, love, silence and secrecy. Dark Pink: Admiration. Light Pink: Femininity and friendship. *(Birth flower for June, also associated with Pride month)*

I think that Guts is a better album, in the sense that it's a better statement, and it's more thoughtful, but there's not a lot of excellence on it. Sour is kind of boring compared to Guts, the tracklist is also a mess, a lot of the songs sound the same however .. it has higher highs. 

I don't think there's any songs on Guts that is as good, individually and not in the context of the body of work that it is, as Drivers License or Deja Vu. Guts is a better album but I don't see any masterpieces on it compared Sour. There's a lot of great songs on Guts, but no instant classics.

"I‚Äôm so upset. In the adrenaline rush for the tickets after being off the wait list I bought three tickets on the floor for my sisters and I which were apparently ADA seats. There definitely was no additional marking when I bought them, no ADA or wheelchair labels, no separate section. There MAY have been a disclamer before I purchased them but it looked the same as any other disclaimer fine-print before you buy anything on Ticketmaster. I definitely could have overlooked this but this was the 5th time I tried to buy a set of three tickets so I was just trying to go fast. I have no idea what to do. I don‚Äôt want to take the tickets away from someone who needs them but unfortunately I‚Äôve already purchased the tickets so in that sense the damage is done. I will try to resell but I‚Äôm afraid they will just go to someone who doesn‚Äôt need ADA anyway. Does anybody have any ideas on how I might be able to set up a trade?

 I am extremely disappointed with the Adele record I received. The vinyl is completely warped and unplayable. The quality of the pressing is subpar and I expected better from such a talented artist. I spent a lot of money on this record and it is unacceptable that it arrived in this condition. I am frustrated with the lack of care put into the production and shipping process. I wouldn't recommend purchasing this record unless improvements are made to the manufacturing process.,https://www.reddit.com/r/adele/comments/13uj6z3/record_broken_19/,record broken???

"Hey Livies! ü¶ã   


First off, **thank you** for getting us to over 21,000 Livies in our subreddit community! We appreciate all the love and respect you help give this fan community on Reddit to make it welcoming and safe for Livies to join and dive into. With your help and deciding to click the join, you help make this subreddit more visible when others search for Olivia on Reddit!  


For those new here, this subreddit community is meant to be a **SFW** subreddit community for all Livies to enjoy without having to deal any unwanted NSFW, creepy, or suggestive content and comments being posted. With your help of reporting content when you see them, we can help to ensure that this place stays that way. We have no plans in changing or allowing NSFW or such here.   


If you're reading this before the **'vampire'** single release, you can expect the main big discussion thread to go up on Thursday, June 29th around 9:00 AM ET/6 AM PT. This is to accommodate Livies living in earlier time zones who might have access to the song earlier than the rest of the world and to prevent too many of the same posts. Don't be alarmed if you think the song released already and can't see it, it's likely not released for you yet. Feel free to also grab the new 'vampire' user flairs to flaunt in the subreddit!  


We've updated and rearranged the subreddit's rules and have made it more clearer on how to handle and post other social media content here. This seems to be the biggest rule offender and we don't mean to take down posts on these non-malicious posts and would like to mediate the process. Hopefully this brings more clarity when posting. Rule 5 is titled as ""Properly Post & Credit Social Media Content"" and is listed as:

* When posting content from a different social media platform (Instagram, TikTok, etc.), please post a downloaded version of it or a cleanly cropped screenshot and post that instead.
* You must also make sure to **link to the original post** in the comment section of your post submission or some other variation for others to use for easy reference.  


And finally, with the release of 'vampire' and 'GUTS' and new merch, we will be bringing back the merch megathreads! Please try to read and use these first before defaulting to creating an individual post for your merch related inquiries.   


**TL;DR - We hit 21k Livies. This subreddit will always be SFW. vampire discussion post will go up early on Thursday. Updated rules for social media content.

" Hanni was attacked and politically insulted by netizens in Vietnam after Newjeans won many major awards at awards ceremonies.    


Below is a translation of some of the thousands of comments in that article.  


Note: ( \*3/\* means referring to the Republic of Vietnam regime, the regime confronting communist Vietnam before 1975 )  
\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Don't erase it, 3/ Hanni is still 3/ Hanni, you can't argue with it, Hanni is reactionary.  


2.Stop defending Hanni, In general, Hanni's mind is oriented towards the 3/ - the regime that ignores the Korean American soldiers who cause many massacres must also know that, keeping their mouth shut is golden.  


3. You can still choose to support Hanni, that's fine, but if you have 3/ like this, don't defend her. After defending, don't you see Hanni selling the country?  


4. 3/ will always be 3/, reactionary.  


5. I used to like this girl, even though she's talented, I can't be sympathetic anymore because she is reactionary, country seller.  


6. This 3/ Hanni has so many people defending her, don't do that, pls hate her, that's a reactionary person.  


7. Reactionary  


8. 3/ is still 3/, Dont support for her even though she is of Vietnamese origin, reactionary.  


9. The group is hot these days, so you guys are confidently defending Hanni's 3/ background. Hanni is a reactionary.  


10. 3 generations of selling country, until generations of descendants are defended by fans, Hanni will always be a country seller hahaha.

"Ariana hands me something plastic right before the front desk worker grabs a handful of hair. Ari leans into my ear as she tells me it's a glow stick so she can watch her good little toy enjoying his cock she keeps stuffing her tongue in my ear driving me crazy. She is making my cock throb like never before. Then in the sexy voice that only Ariana possesses she tell the front desk worker to stuff his cock and his ball sack in my mouth together.

As my mouth fills up with dick and balls I fell Ari lift my skirt and spit bullseye right into my virgin pucker hole. Then I hear her unsnapping her stilletto's and that's when I feel all six inches of her $3,000 fuck me pumps getting shoved in my ass. That stilletto's heel is getting pumped into and out of my asshole like she is some kind ass fucking witch. I've never felt anything feel so good.

When she knows I'm getting ready to blow my load she pulls my cock backwards through my legs and pumps my load into her mouth.   She doesn't swallow it. She spits some on my tight sphincter then shoves 2 fingers in and massages my prostate. After making me cum one more time  knowing my mouth is full of dick she forcefully crams her fist into my ass. It was like my balls had an emergency evacuation of every drop of my sperm. I cum so hard I black out. The next thing I know the front desk worker is fuckin my worn out anus like im a 3 dollar hooker who is only getting paid 2.50 in expired condom coupons. 

Ari can see I'm about to pass out and tells the front desk worker he better cum in the next 30 seconds or she would step on his cock wearing her spike heels. I could feel him throbbing and hear his labored ragged breathing. As he  let's loose in my no longer tight asshole  he calls me a good for nothing fucking cum dumpster so I reach back and squeeze his cock and balls until there are tears in his eyes and kick him out the closet to put himself back together and get back to work. I hear Ari talking to him and she keeps calling him faggot and queer and he can't figure out why.   That's when she opens the closet door grabs my leash , pulls me out into the light where you can see his load dripping from me and she starts laughing so hard she acts like she is about to wet herself. She says silly faggot dicks are for chicks.  

You could see the rage washing over him. Ari is laughing so hard she has pissed her panties. All of the sudden you hear hey hoe. Ari looks up while trying to cover her soaking wet panties and that's when he throws a right hook and catches her right in the jaw.  She folds like a flea market sun chair and I catch her. The front desk worker takes his belt and ties her wrists together behind her back. He slides her piss dripping panties from the most beautiful pussy lips we have ever seen. 

He doesn't even hesitate when shoving her piss soaked panties into her mouth then duct tapes her mouth closed. He looks at me and says it's time to wake her up. We both walk up to this angel cocks in our hands and we proceed to test just how waterproof her mascara really is.

"Welcome back to the Popheads Jukebox! Here are [last week‚Äôs results](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/15tzm98/the_popheads_jukebox_revival_week_235_i_am_not_a/):

* Jessie Ware, R√≥is√≠n Murphy - Freak Me Now: 8.25
* Doja Cat - Paint The Town Red: 7.84
* Kali Uchis - Mu√±ekita (with El Alfa & JT from City Girls): 7.60
* Halle - Angel: 7.25
* Tove Lo - Elevator Eyes: 5.50

--
 
* Halsey - I am not a woman, I‚Äôm a god: 9.75
* Katy Perry - Roar: 3.67

It's not great timing, but Jessie and Roisin are this week's highest, and the only track out of our main selection to pass the 8.0 mark. For Doja, Kali, Halle, and especially Tove, we didn't quite love their latest releases though there's nothing really too horrid there. It's a different story in the throwback section, where Halsey manages to get one of the highest scores of all the catch-up tracks we've done (a clear sign that we need to rate IICHLIWP asap!), while Katy completely bombs on the 10th anniversary of Roar.


---

###Rules Refresher

1. Rate the songs a score from 1 to 10. Please keep it to one decimal place at the most (so 7.5 is fine but 7.58 is not). Also don‚Äôt get too hung up on the final scores. This is a fun exercise and not a competition so don‚Äôt worry about over/under rating things. Just give what you think the song is to you.

2. For your review, reply to the comment that will be posted by one of us for each song. Avoid posting your reviews as a top level comment cause we probably won‚Äôt notice them if you do. Non-reviews such as questions or general commentary as upper level comments are fine.

3. Must have some sort of justification. Try to be a bit more concise than ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bop!‚Äù or ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like it‚Äù. Explain why! It doesn‚Äôt have to be long, two or three sentences can be plenty (though more is definitely allowed). We reserve the right not to include a review in the final total if proper justification is not given.

4. You don‚Äôt have to review each song to participate! You can do all of them or only the ones you‚Äôre familiar with.

5. The thread will be open for 6 days and close the following Wednesday at 9PM EST. The scores will be calculated and a new post will come up the next day (Thursday) at 5PM EST  with the next week‚Äôs tracks.

"On the Jimmy Kimmel interview, she said that the original lyrics of All American B*tch were ""All American lips and all American t*ts"" and Get Him Back was ""I miss the way he grabs my a*s""

NewJeans is a new kind of K-pop juggernaut

In a little more than a year, NewJeans has become huge in the world of K-pop, with a reputation for upending industry conventions. They've become the fastest K-pop act ever to reach one billion streams on Spotify, and their new EP, Get Up, just hit number one on the Billboard charts. Plus, their single ""OMG"" went viral on TikTok, spawning dance challenges and memes.",https://www.npr.org/2023/08/15/1193958358/newjeans-is-a-new-kind-of-k-pop-juggernaut,20230831 NPR Pop Culture Happy Hour: NewJeans,NewJeans,t3_16637hz,/r/NewJeans/comments/16637hz/20230831_npr_pop_culture_happy_hour_newjeans/,2023-08-31 06:31:09,New Jeans

"How did we do? üòÇ I ordered iron-on ""seemingly ranch"" patches for the white dress, and then had a Travis jersey made with ""ketchup"" in place of his name. Kudos to waterproof eyeliner for the classic mustache. We thought that it was convenient that his team color is red, and a white dress was an obvious choice for ranch.... A quick steam on the dress to combat wrinkles from shipping would have been ideal to align more with Taylor's elegance, but I didn't think about that until it was almost time to head out to the event.

"I've heard from a couple of industry insiders that a Japanese debut might be imminent (before the end of the year but probably much sooner) so I wanted to put a feeler out to see what everyone's thoughts are.

A couple of things to consider

1) Is the timing right? - There is apparently a lot of discussion within the industry about the big picture as it relates to NewJeans. By playing their cards right, some experts think that the NJs sphere of influence can penetrate the Western market unlike any other K-pop groups (except BTS of course). Given this, is it the right time to try and make inroads into the Japanese market? 

As far as I can tell, it's not entirely unprecedented for a group to debut in Japan this soon. Twice, BP, BTS, IVE have all had their Japanese debut about 1 to 1.5 yrs after their Korean debut. It seems like a logical next step to me but will there be a significant opportunity cost if they forgo a chance to focus on the Western market?

2) Music and Concepting - Do they choose to go with a basic compilation album or do something completely original? There's no doubt that almost all of NJs discography is popular in Japan right now. Releasing Japanese versions of existing songs is probably the safest bet but is it on brand for NJs/MHJ? I do think there's potential here to create a unique enough identity for themselves that can pay huge dividends down the line. 

If they decide to do something original, what kind of music and concept would you like to see? I kind of get the feeling that a city pop vibe would be the fan favorite but still interested to see if there are some diverse opinions.

"She has many allusions to astrology in her lyrics (The Archer, ‚Äútwin fire signs‚Äù, scorpions stinging, etc), she‚Äôs mentioned Mercury Retrograde as recently as this summer when she injured her hand, and here‚Äôs an interview from Rolling Stone in 2019 where she talks about having a discussion with Katy Perry about their astrological signs and how it influences their different responses and approaches to life. 

‚ÄúWe were talking about our signs because we had this really, really long talk when we were reconnecting and stuff. And I remember in the long talk, she was like, ‚ÄúIf we had one glass of white wine right now, we‚Äôd both be crying.‚Äù Because we were drinking tea. We‚Äôve had some really good conversations.

We were talking about how we‚Äôve had miscommunications with people in the past, not even specifically with each other. She‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a Scorpio. Scorpios just strike when they feel threatened.‚Äù And I was like, ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm an archer. We literally stand back, assess the situation, process how we feel about it, raise a bow, pull it back, and fire.‚Äù So it‚Äôs completely different ways of processing pain, confusion, misconception. And oftentimes I‚Äôve had this delay in feeling something that hurts me and then saying that it hurts me. Do you know what I mean? And so I can understand how people in my life would have been like, ‚ÄúWhoa, I didn‚Äôt know that was how you felt.‚Äù Because it takes me a second.‚Äù",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/taylor-swift-rolling-stone-interview-880794/,Taylor Swift believes in astrology,TaylorSwift,t3_17abs2b,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/17abs2b/taylor_swift_believes_in_astrology/,2023-10-17 23:17:39,Taylor Swift

"Idk if anyone else had this idea but I‚Äôve been thinking about it all of this morning. I was up late last night and saw some people on the internet personifying the albums, which I think is super cute (I think Alef Vernon does it best, I love his art). As I was thinking about it, I imagined if the albums had actually names instead of being called Rep, 1989, and Folklore. Sooooo I was wondering if anyone had any fun suggestions for each album‚Äôs human name. So far I only came up with a cute name for Rep: Tate, because it kinda is within the name Repu[Tate]ion. 

Debut ‚Äî

Fearless ‚Äî

Speak Now ‚Äî

Red ‚Äî

1989 ‚Äî

Reputation ‚Äî Tate

Anyways today I showed my mum one of Billies songs and she complimented it and talked about it with me for like 10 minutes and afterwards I cried (of happiness ofc LMAOOO) afterwards. Please, I don't know why I cried, but it made me feel so happy that she likes her music which makes it more likely for me to go to a concert, and it just made me happy that she liked the music I like. 

I'm just an emotional wreck üò≠ü§£ü§£ but anyways sharing this idk why and it'll probably be deleted soon haha",https://www.reddit.com/r/billieeilish/comments/18rkkfg/am_i_weird_lmao/,Am I weird lmao,billieeilish,t3_18rkkfg,/r/billieeilish/comments/18rkkfg/am_i_weird_lmao/,2023-12-26 22:46:57,Billie Eilish
Lacy comes off as if Olivia is coming out. Sure I believe Lacy has multiple meanings but I believe Olivia being bisexual is one of them. But I‚Äôve noticed people doesn‚Äôt like this when mentioned. If Olivia came out as bi would it actually be problem if she was. Because she writes a songs about bad break ups with boyfriends. Would it be so bad that she represents LGBTQIA+ too?,https://www.reddit.com/r/OliviaRodrigo/comments/18gdq3b/would_people_really_be_mad_if_olivia_came_out_as/,Would people really be mad if Olivia came out as bi?,OliviaRodrigo,t3_18gdq3b,/r/OliviaRodrigo/comments/18gdq3b/would_people_really_be_mad_if_olivia_came_out_as/,2023-12-12 04:38:11,Olivia Rodrigo

"Hi everyone! I got a ticket for the Palm Desert show in February (so excited!).

It‚Äôs the smallest venue of her entire tour - though it is the opening night of her tour, so maybe she wants to kick off things with a smaller crowd?

"I've been seeing a number of comments regarding the lovely posters sold in the Adele boutique store. I want to share some helpful information to consider if you're thinking about buying one at the show.

Things to know:

1. There are two unique posters for each weekend and the show date is included at the bottom.
2. They're relatively cheap compared to the rest of the store, only $20!
3. Available by request only i.e they are not set out in the store for you to pick up. You must ask for the poster at the checkout counter.
4. Consider how you will travel home with the poster! They'll give you a rubber band to roll it up, but no protective sleeve. I ended up buying a dry erase calendar kit from Walgreens (aka long rectangular plastic box), ditching the calendar, then putting the Adele poster inside. It was \~$10 and worked really well. Notably I was in a pinch for time and couldn't locate a proper office supply store to find a poster tube.
5. The posters will sell out! I would absolutely NOT recommend waiting until after the show to make your purchases (posters or anything else really). After seeing such a phenomenal show, you and many others might feel you absolutely \*need\* and may flock to the merch table in the Colosseum and/or the Adele boutique nearby. The lines will be long and the poster in particular will very likely already be sold out. Going to the boutique during the day time or in the evening before the show is much more laid back and easier for perusing/fawning over all the items for purchase!

Adele and her show is beautiful and wonderful and amazing. Enjoy!",https://www.reddit.com/r/adele/comments/10554kl/tips_for_buying_weekends_with_adele_posters/,Tips for buying Weekends with Adele Posters,adele,t3_10554kl,/r/adele/comments/10554kl/tips_for_buying_weekends_with_adele_posters/,2023-01-06 20:50:57,Adele
"To preface this: I‚Äôm a fan of nwjns and am in no way hating on them, but them getting brand endorsements so quickly is kind of too soon? It‚Äôs great that they‚Äôre getting their coin, but they are a rookie group less than a year old and haven‚Äôt established themselves in fashion yet. I don‚Äôt have a feel for any of the members‚Äô sense of personal style, and their outfits feel coordinated by their stylists mostly. In a way, it feels inorganic almost - I mean blackpink were going to different shows and built connections in the fashion world before becoming brand ambassadors and every member matches what their respective brand (Chanel, Celine, Dior, YSL). 

I know nwjns is big right now, but are they actually being noticed by brands or do you think the company might be reaching out to the brand? Honestly hyein being a LV ambassador at 14 is interesting because I don‚Äôt think her body is fully developed enough for the clothes LV makes. Someone like Milly Bobby Brown was over 18 when she was signed to LV. 

If anything, I thought Sakura would‚Äôve been an official luxury brand ambassador over a nwjns member because of her extensive career and reach in Asia and especially Japan (a target Asian market). Nwjns should‚Äôve done a group brand endorsement like aespa is for Givenchy because the group as a whole is doing good, but the members individually haven‚Äôt built a strong fan base yet to be endorsing the brands individually. I guess you can make the argument that they‚Äôre big in Korea and only Korean ambassadors but some of them are global ambassadors for the brands they have. Is MHJ trying to market them as expensive teenagers?  

I‚Äôm curious to know what people‚Äôs thoughts are on this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/117w7gr/is_new_jeans_working_in_fashion_too_soon/,Is New Jeans working in fashion too soon?,kpopthoughts,t3_117w7gr,/r/kpopthoughts/comments/117w7gr/is_new_jeans_working_in_fashion_too_soon/,2023-02-21 06:07:54,New Jeans

"Now that everyone's had some time to listen on repeat the new NJWMX album, I thought it might be a good idea to revisit ranking the tracks. Curious to hear how you'd rank them, here's mine:

1. Hype Boy - The jazziness and slower tempo is amazing. Best remix on this album, hands down.


2. Cookie - I get serious Wii music vibes (Wii Shop Channel) from this one especially at the start, and I love it. I didn't think I'd like this as much as I did, it's really good.


3. OMG - It sounds more Christmasy but not too over the top which I appreciate. The chorus goes hard.


4. Ditto - It doesn't sound as dark as the original, but I do enjoy the slight variation to this one.


5. Hurt - As a new fan, I wasn't aware of this remix before, so this was my first time listening to it. I do like this remix a fair bit, but maybe not as high on it as others are.


6. Attention - Wasn't too fond of this one as much as the others for some reason. Much prefer the original.

I can't wait for when we get official remixes of the Get Up tracks, I'm guessing it could be a possibility next Christmas.

"For context I‚Äôm 26, I was (very luckily) able to see Taylor Swift twice when growing up. I had decent seats and got them for $100 (or less). Understand that times have changed but I‚Äôm genuinely in awe of the prices I‚Äôve seen on here. Most of Olivia‚Äôs target demographic is much younger than me, and not working. How are people expected to pay $200 PLUS for a ticket to see an artist they like? What is making the prices so horrible? Concerts are no where worth $100 plus IMO even if it‚Äôs someone who is your idol.

Maybe it was only perfect time they could've think of, since Ariana, Taylor and other big names are expected to release something soon.

**ISO:**

All ISO related posts should be commented in this megathread from now on. *Individual ISO posts will be removed.*

&#x200B;

**SELLING & TRADING:**

Please review the [selling](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwiftMerch/wiki/selling) & [trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwiftMerch/wiki/trading) rules before commenting. As a reminder, your Reddit account should be at least one month old if you want to sell or trade.

The *basic* rules are (but PLEASE review the full rules):

* **You MUST upload a photo of the items you are trading or selling** \- No stock images or images that are not yours. You can upload images to Imgur and share the link in a comment on this post. **THIS ALSO APPLIES TO TRADE OFFERS. Comment with a photo of your item you are offering to trade before private messaging.**
   * Any very RARE items should have a photo with a handwritten timestamp (your Reddit username and the date handwritten on a piece of paper).
   * i.e. ""Record Store Days"" Vinyl Records, 'Lover' Snow Globe, Signed Items, and Lithographs
* If you are interested in a sale or trade, comment ""Sent a private message to you. I accept your listed price or I have X item to trade"" so the moderator(s) know who is reaching out to who.
* No ""Taking offers"" comments - **Items being sold must have a clear price**. If anyone tries to sell something to you ABOVE their listed price - please let the moderators know.
   * If you want to negotiate a lower price or offer something else that is not an ISO, please do so in the comments first.
   * Insane price gouging is not allowed.
   * If you are unsure about the value of an item, feel free to make a post with the ""Fair Trade/Value Question"" flair.
* ***Please edit your comment once you've accepted an offer and tag the user you are selling or trading to.***
* **No trade or sale sniping** \- If an offer is accepted, other members should wait 24 hours before commenting to ask if the transaction went through. If two users make the same offer, the person who offered first gets priority.

There are a lot of scammers out there or bad sellers so these rules are in place to help protect the members of this subreddit. There are new members joining every day and some people are completely new to Reddit. No worries if you make some mistakes.

"I highly doubt I'm the only one who's thought this, but I haven't seen many people talking about it. In 'Seven,' the lyrics, ""And I've been meaning to tell you, I think your house is haunted. Your dad's always mad and that must be why,"" have a double meaning.

The first meaning being a more child like view on anger and not fully understanding it, chalking it up to a haunted house weighing down on a soul, making the person consistently agitated, angry, and aggressive. 

The second meaning, the most compelling in my opinion, is that the house in question isn't an actual house, but instead the person Taylor is talking to. The house being a metaphor for our minds, bodies, lives; that we're always haunted by this anger, that it's changed us to our core. ""Your dad's always mad and that must be why,"" this like pointing to the way we grew up, the things we had to deal with, had to witness and survive and that this overwhelming anger is what caused the ""haunting"" in our minds, completely changed down to our foundation. 

In short, we are the house. Our minds are the house. We are haunted by the events of our past and Taylor wishes to take us away, even in imagination, from the pain, hoping to distract us enough to keep us from crying.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/17sfwz7/seven_and_the_double_meaning_of_some_lyrics/,'Seven' and the double meaning of some lyrics,TaylorSwift,t3_17sfwz7,/r/TaylorSwift/comments/17sfwz7/seven_and_the_double_meaning_of_some_lyrics/,2023-11-10 22:39:42,Taylor Swift
